Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images By Sara Castellanos Close Sara Castellanos Biography @SCastellWSJ sara.castellanos@wsj.com Sept. 9, 2021 4:11 pm ET Information-technology leaders say they are boosting compensation packages and flexible work options to widen the pool of prospective job candidates, as demand surges for tech talent. The IT job market in the U.S. has added an average of about 13,000 positions during each month of 2021 so far, up from a typical monthly average of between 5,000 and 8,000 jobs, said Victor Janulaitis, chief executive of Utah-based consulting firm Janco Associates Inc., which analyzes data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Growth in the IT job market has been largely driven by the push toward digital initiatives such as e-commerce during the pandemic, as well as the need for cybersecurity experts, he said. Overall demand for workers in the U.S. remained strong, with postings on job-search site Indeed.com up about 39% at the end of August from February 2020, The Wall Street Journal previously reported . Newsletter Sign-up WSJ | CIO Journal The Morning Download delivers daily insights and news on business technology from the CIO Journal team. PREVIEW SUBSCRIBE Data from the Labor Department showed there were 10.9 million unfilled jobs at the end of July, when the Delta variant surge started, exceeding the 8.7 million Americans who were unemployed and seeking jobs that month. To recruit employees and retain existing tech staff, IT leaders say they are offering flexible work options, such as a combination of in-person and remote work. The median salary for IT professionals is expected to grow to between $96,000 and $97,000, up from $94,600 in January and $95,600 in June, Mr. Janulaitis said. “The talent market is very competitive and becoming more so, given the continuing importance of digital transformation and digital business models,” said Arthur Hu, chief information officer of personal computer-maker Lenovo Group Ltd., which currently has hundreds of IT job openings. Positions such as technical product managers are in high demand and sometimes difficult to fill, said Mr. Hu, adding that he often sources “nontraditional” candidates who might come from a different industry, geography or discipline. Prakash Kota, CIO of Autodesk Photo: Autodesk “Good ideas can come from anywhere,” he said. Software company Autodesk Inc. has hired about 250 IT staffers since the start of the pandemic in early 2020, said Prakash Kota, the company’s CIO. The IT group has not recruited at that rate before, he said. He attributes the hiring push to the company’s goal of insourcing technology talent related to artificial intelligence, data science and cloud computing, Mr. Kota said. Data science jobs are difficult roles to fill, he said. The company offers competitive pay and the option of a mix of in-person and remote work to recruit IT staff, he said. “Culture plays a significant role” in hiring and retaining talent, he said. For example, it is important to ensure that IT staff members feel like they are contributing to important initiatives and making an impact on the business. Talent is a top priority for Rob Alexander, CIO of Capital One Financial Corp., which aims to hire more than 3,000 technologists by year’s end. Many of those roles include software engineers focused on cloud computing, data, machine learning and cybersecurity. Rob Alexander, CIO of Capital One Photo: Capital One To differentiate itself from competitors and attract top technology talent, the bank has been putting an emphasis on continuous learning, diversity and workplace culture, Mr. Alexander said. The company is also using its migration to Amazon Web Services, Amazon.com Inc.’s public cloud, as a selling point for new hires because it allows engineers to focus on building and deploying new applications and services quickly while using the latest software tools. “For me and my leadership team, our highest calling is to build a world-class technology team and to unleash the potential of that talent,” Mr. Alexander said. Cathleen Southwick, CIO at Pure Storage Inc., a data-management and storage firm, said it is tough to find qualified candidates, particularly software engineers, in the U.S. and globally. The Mountain View, Calif.-based company is competing against other Silicon Valley giants for technology talent. Pure Storage tries to entice prospective employees by offering a flexible work style on a case-by-case basis, as well as competitive compensation packages. Ms. Southwick said the company also offers certification programs in areas such as cloud and IT services, to make IT staffers aware that the company is investing in their careers. IT leaders will need to play a pivotal role in recruiting and retaining talent in the competitive job market, she said. “We’re going to have to keep reinventing how, where and what we offer to employees, whether it’s our benefits, flexibility or locations,” she said.

Global ATP Chair John Kleeman, Founder of Questionmark, in emphasizing the importance of this year’s virtual Security Summit focusing on Artificial Intelligence, had this to say: “In reality, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a confusing and sometimes misunderstood term. Many testing organizations are planning or using AI, others are using algorithmic or automated decision-making. All of us need to be aware of the potential benefit but also the risks of bias and the threat of regulation of AI and of other algorithms in assessment. We need to be asking how AI can help in assessment, what is its future and how can we be responsible using it?"" To understand and address these questions, Kleeman noted, the first challenge is to truly grasp what AI is, and what it means within the assessment industry.  “The ATP community is leading the conversation on responsible use of AI in assessment. And that’s what this year’s two-day Summit is about – to understand, to parse out the complexities, and to influence where AI is going…or perhaps, where it is taking us,” Kleeman remarked. The Summit begins even before it opens – with a pre-read ATP White Paper assigned to all attendees: Artificial Intelligence and the Testing Industry: A Primer,  which is available on the ATP website at www.testpublishers.org . Then, building upon the wave of information about AI that has been made available over the past year, the two-day Summit will: •	Engage in discussions on test security, privacy, compliance challenges, and opportunities at play when building and administering tests using AI and automated decision-making; and •	Provide actionable steps testing programs, test publishers, and industry service providers can take to address them. Kleeman noted, “this really is an opportunity to learn how to responsibly use AI in assessment from industry professionals specializing in test creation, security, technology, and privacy.” This year's Summit program, (which can be accessed online at http://eatpconference.org/security-summit-agenda.aspx ) includes speakers from industry leaders such as Microsoft, Duolingo, and Multi-Health Systems, Inc. and will address the theme with sessions focusing on the ethical use of AI to improve security, the future of regulating the use of AI, and strategies to educate public policy makers about how AI can be responsibly managed in the assessment industry. Registration and sponsorship is open at: http://eatpconference.org/register.aspx [Registration for the Summit can be as a stand alone event, or combined with a registration to ATP’s virtual European ATP Conference being held a week later, 27 – 29 September, 2021.] About the ATP and the ATP Security Committee Established in 1992, Global ATP is an international, non-profit, trade organization representing providers of tests and assessment tools and/or services related to assessment for clinical, occupational, certification, licensing, educational or other similar uses. The ATP Security Committee provides a forum to encourage assessment organizations to collaborate in addressing test security concerns. The goals of the Committee are to: (1) identify methods to improve test security; (2) establish and disseminate security best practices; and (3) protect the integrity of assessments and assessment programs. By focusing on industry needs and providing solutions, we are creating a resource center for ATP members to access information and assistance for implementing or improving security efforts and programs.

Today, much robotic technology is developed without considering its potentially harmful effects on society, including how these technologies can infringe on privacy or further economic inequity. The new UT Austin program will fill an important educational gap by prioritizing these issues in its curriculum. “In the next 10 years, we are going to live more closely alongside robots, and we want to be sure that those robots are fair, inclusive and free from bias,” said Junfeng Jiao, associate professor in the School of Architecture and the program lead. “And because the robots we create are reflections of ourselves, it is imperative that technologists receive an excellent ethics education. We want our students to work directly with companies to create practices and technologies that are equitable and fair.” Called CREATE (Convergent, Responsible, and Ethical AI Training Experience for Roboticists), it will offer graduate coursework and professional development in responsible design and implementation. CREATE is a collaboration among Texas Robotics, industry partners and the UT grand challenge research initiative Good Systems , which seeks to design AI technologies that benefit society. The program has been recently awarded a $3 million grant from the National Science Foundation through its Research Traineeship Program , which will support 32 doctoral students to receive coursework, mentorship, professional development, internships, and research and public service opportunities. Students will focus specifically on how to ethically design, develop and deploy service robots, which can make deliveries, work in factories and clean homes. They will consider factors such as how to design delivery service robots so they are more inclusive and can reach all people and how to ensure home service robots protect occupants’ privacy. Several notable robotics companies have also said they will offer students internships, including Sony AI, Bosch, Amazon, SparkCognition and Apptronik. Researchers involved in the program cross many disciplines at UT, including computer science, architecture, engineering, information, and public affairs. Faculty members from these units will teach courses as part of the curriculum, and two faculty members will mentor each trainee during the five-year program. Additionally, each trainee will receive help with career development, grant writing, and exposure to local startup companies. More than half of the program’s trainees will be chosen from underrepresented groups in STEM education, including women and racial minorities, to help bring much-needed diversity to the field of robotics. The coursework component, which includes five classes in ethical robotics, will be institutionalized as a graduate portfolio program and will be available to all STEM graduate students at UT Austin. “This program will enable us to educate well-rounded roboticists who are not only grounded in the technical details of designing and building autonomous robots but also are equipped to fully consider the societal implications of their work,” said Peter Stone, director of Texas Robotics and a professor of computer science. “That is a missing part in robotics education in the U.S. and the world. We believe this is a game changer for the future of robotics.” Copy link Email Share Link Twitter Share Link Facebook Share Link LinkedIn Share Link Copy link Email Share Link Twitter Share Link Facebook Share Link LinkedIn Share Link Media Contact Mary Huber Office of the Vice President for Research e: mary.huber@austin.utexas.edu The University of Texas at Austin Explore Latest Articles Sep 13, 2021 UT Austin Climbs in Latest National Undergraduate Rankings Read More UT Austin Climbs in Latest National Undergraduate Rankings Sep 10, 2021 We built this city.

By Kim Martineau September 09, 2021 Columbia researchers Pierre Gentine (left) and Galen McKinley will lead the new climate modeling center. (Image: Marley Bauce) This past summer was marked by intense wildfires, heat waves, flooding, and drought around the world. How much more extreme weather can we expect in the coming decades? It’s hard to say. Climate change is complex, and the farther ahead we look, the cloudier the projections get. Globally, this uncertainty has often been used as an excuse to put off expensive or unpopular measures like building seawalls, retreating inland, and upgrading or relocating electrical grids, transit systems, and other critical infrastructure. A Q&A with Columbia researchers Galen McKinley and Carl Vondrick How Next-Generation Climate Models Will Improve on What We Have Now To bring greater precision to climate modeling and encourage societies to prepare for the inevitable disruptions ahead, the National Science Foundation (NSF) has selected Columbia to lead a climate modeling center called Learning the Earth with Artificial Intelligence and Physics (LEAP). In collaboration with the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), the center will develop the next generation of data-driven physics-based climate models. It will also train a new wave of students fluent in both climate science and working with big datasets and modern machine-learning algorithms. The center’s larger goal is to provide actionable information for societies to adapt to climate change and protect the most vulnerable. “Until climate models can offer more precise projections, at the regional level where planning decisions are made, it will be difficult to make the billion-dollar investments needed to adapt,"" said Columbia President Lee C. Bollinger.  ""I can think of no better university than Columbia, with its interdisciplinary focus, to lead the way in tackling the climate prediction problem.” Wildfires in New Mexico in 2020. (Photo: USFS, National Interagency Fire Center, via Wikimedia Commons) The center will be led by Columbia Engineering, Columbia's Faculty of Arts of Sciences, and Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, in collaboration with Teachers College, Columbia Business School, the School of Social Work, and the new cross-cutting Columbia Climate School. Global climate models agree that the planet will continue to warm in the next 40 years. But they disagree on how much, and how severe the impacts will be, from sea-level rise to an increase in floods and drought. Much of the problem comes down to trying to represent the details of complex physical and biological processes—like clouds reflecting sunlight into space or trees absorbing carbon from the air—into the models. Processes interact, and many are poorly understood. With the help of big data and machine learning, researchers will dig deeper into these processes and update the models with new knowledge to improve climate projections. Researchers will harness existing algorithms to analyze satellite images and other large-scale observational data missing from today’s models. They will also develop new algorithms to take detailed observations and generalize them to broader contexts, discover cause and effect relationships in the data, and find better equations to describe the processes represented in the models. As new knowledge gets woven into the models, researchers will use machine-learning tools to test their predictions. In addition to NCAR and GISS, Columbia researchers will collaborate with peers at New York University, and universities of California at Irvine, Minnesota, and Montreal to update the NSF-funded and NCAR-based Community Earth System Model . More accurate modeling will allow researchers to gaze farther into the future, and at closer geographic range.  “Let’s say I want to know the number of heat-wave days in NYC in 2050,” said center director Pierre Gentine , a professor of earth and environmental engineering. “Some models may say 10 days. Some say 20 days.

More accurate models will help give us a clearer vision of the future.” Dealing with massive data requires a modern infrastructure. In collaboration with Google Cloud and Microsoft, Ryan Abernathey , an associate professor of earth and environmental sciences based at Lamont-Doherty, will create a platform to allow researchers to share and analyze data. To achieve its mission, the center will create a new discipline merging climate science with data science and AI. Carl Vondrick , an assistant professor of computer science, will lead the team developing new algorithms to advance the science of climate change and improve current models. Tian Zheng , a statistics professor and chair of the department, will lead a team developing undergraduate and graduate educational programs that blend climate science and data science, and classroom learning with research experience. Climate change will affect all of humanity, yet most climate science research to date has failed to draw from the full diversity of people and ideas available. To address the imbalance, the center will make diversity, equity, and inclusion central to its research and education mission. Courtney D. Cogburn , an associate professor of social work and a member of the Data Science Institute, will oversee diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives and the transfer of knowledge to communities most vulnerable to climate change. “Confronting the threat of climate change will require our brightest minds and best technologies,” said Columbia Provost Mary Boyce . “The LEAP center, with its entwined research and education mission, will play a pivotal role in getting us there.” Columbia will contribute to two other NSF Science and Technology Centers chosen for funding this year, joining Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in studying how ocean microbes impact carbon cycling and climate, and the University of Washington in developing optoelectronic materials, devices, and systems to generate, sense, and control light.

Edit Story Sep 10, 2021, 01:53am EDT | How Do We Use Artificial Intelligence Ethically? Bernard Marr Contributor Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Enterprise Tech Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin I’m hugely passionate about artificial intelligence (AI) , and I'm proud to say that I help companies use AI to do amazing things in the world. But we must make sure we use AI responsibly, so we can make the world a better place. In this post, I’m going to give you some tips for making sure you apply AI ethically within your organization. How Do We Use Artificial Intelligence Ethically? AdobeStock 1. Start with education and awareness about AI. Communicate clearly with people (externally and internally) about what AI can do and its challenges. It is possible to use AI for the wrong reasons, so organizations need to figure out the right purposes for using AI and how to stay within predefined ethical boundaries. Everyone across the organization needs to understand what AI is, how it can be used, and what its ethical challenges are. 2. Be transparent. This is one of the biggest things I stress with every organization I work with. Every organization needs to be open and honest (both internally and externally) about how they’re using AI. One of my clients, the Royal Bank of Scotland, wanted to use AI to improve some of the services they provide to their clients. When they began their initiative, they were (and continue to be) transparent and clear with their customers about what data they were collecting, how that data was being used, and what benefits the customers were getting from it. MORE FOR YOU It’s Time To End The SEC’s “Clarity” Charade On Crypto Digital Transformation Is Only The Beginning: A Company’s Journey The Crypto Uprising The SEC Didn’t See Coming When I look at the recent Cambridge Analytica scandal, I feel like a big part of the problem was Facebook’s lack of transparency about how they were using AI and how they were collecting and using their customers’ data. A clear AI communication policy could have solved a lot of problems before they even happened. Customers need to trust the companies they work with – and that requires full transparency about how AI fits into the company’s overall strategy and how it affects customers. 3. Control for bias. As much as possible, organizations need to make sure the data they're using is not biased. For instance, Google created a huge database of facial images called ImageNet. Their data set included far more white faces than non-white faces, so when they trained AIs to use this data, they worked better on white faces than non-white ones. Creating better data sets and better algorithms is not just an opportunity to use AI ethically – it’s also a way to try to address some racial and gender biases in the world on a larger scale. 4. Make it explainable. Can your artificial intelligence algorithms be explained? When we use modern AI tools like deep learning, they can be “black boxes” where humans don’t really understand the decision-making processes within their algorithms. Companies feed them data, the AIs learn from that data, and then they make a decision. But if you use deep learning algorithms to determine who should get healthcare treatment and who doesn't, or who should be allowed to go on parole and who shouldn’t, these are massively big decisions with huge implications for individual lives. It is increasingly important for organizations to understand exactly how the AI makes decisions and be able to explain those systems. A lot of work has recently gone into the development of explainable AIs. We now have ways to better explain even the most complicated deep learning systems, so there’s no excuse for having a continued air of confusion or mystery around your algorithms. 5. Make it inclusive. At the moment, we have far too many male, white people working on AI. We need to make sure the people building the AI systems of the future are as diverse as our world. There is some progress in bringing in more women and people of color (POC) to make sure the AI you’re building truly represents our society as a whole, but that has to go far further. 6. Follow the rules. Of course, when it comes to the use of AI, we must adhere to regulation. We are seeing increasing regulation of AI in Europe and in parts of the US. However, there’s still a lot of unregulated parts that rely on self-regulation by organizations. Companies like Google and Microsoft are focusing on using AI for good, and Google has its own self-defined AI principles. When I work with organizations, we often put together an ethics council for AI that acts as the North Star for AI ethics concerns for that company. Whenever an organization identifies a use case for AI, the ethics council evaluates it for ethical concerns. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), was founded in 1961 to stimulate economic progress, and it includes 37 member countries. The organization created the OECD AI principles, which are a great starting point for thinking about how your organization can use AI in ways that benefit people and the planet. Then AI should be designed in a way that respects laws, human rights, democratic values, and diversity. AI must function in a robust, secure, and safe way, with risks being continuously assessed and managed. Organizations developing AI should be held accountable for the proper functioning of these systems in line with these principles. The 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations can also be a great resource for you as you’re establishing your AI use cases . If the way you're using AI aligns with OECD principles and the UN Sustainable Development Goals, you're probably well on your way to ensuring that you're using AI ethically.

U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said in a press release on Thursday (Sept. 9) that “top-level candidates” are currently being sought to serve on the National Artificial Intelligence Advisory Committee (NAIAC). See also: LUMO Labs Backs Autoscriber to Advance Healthcare AI Voice Recognition “AI presents an enormous opportunity to tackle the biggest issues of our time, strengthen our technological competitiveness and be an engine for growth in nearly every sector of the economy,” said Raimondo. “But we must be thoughtful, creative and wise in how we address the challenges that accompany these new technologies. That includes, but is not limited to, ensuring that President Biden’s comprehensive commitment to advancing equity and racial justice extends to our development and use of AI technology. This committee will help the federal government do that by providing insights into a full range of issues raised by AI.” Related news: Walmart Partners With Meredith for AI-Informed Contextual Grocery Commerce The formation of the committee comes the National AI Initiative Act of 2020, which called on the Secretary of Commerce to establish the NAIAC in conjunction with the OSTP director and other federal agencies — the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of State and the Attorney General. “We have seen major advances in the design, development and use of AI, especially in the past several years,” said Eric Lander, White House science advisor and OSTP director. “We must be sure that these advances are matched by similar progress in ensuring that AI is trustworthy and that it ensures fairness and protections for civil rights.” You may also enjoy: Mastercard Buys Crypto Intel Startup CipherTrace Experts from an extensive range of AI domains are being recruited to comprise the NAIAC, including accomplished leaders from “across academia, industry, nonprofits and civil society, and federal laboratories,” according to the release. The goal is to have qualified authorities on the committee who can proffer counsel and insight on AI concerning science and tech research, ethics, standards, education, security and more. Since AI is already transforming economic rivalry and presenting new national security concerns, NIST is poised to affirm that all AI advancements are fostered and utilized responsibly. —————————— NEW PYMNTS DATA: TODAY’S SELF-SERVICE SHOPPING JOURNEY – SEPTEMBER 2021 About: Eighty percent of consumers are interested in using nontraditional checkout options like self-service, yet only 35 percent were able to use them for their most recent purchases.

This article was written by Bob Friday, Vice President and Chief Technology Officer of Juniper’s AI-Driven Enterprise Business. In a recent survey of 700 IT pros around the world, 95% said they believe their companies would benefit from embedding artificial intelligence (AI) into daily operations, products, and services, and 88% want to use AI as much as possible. When was the last time you heard that many people agree on anything? Yes, AI is all the rage because it is the next step in the evolution of automation in doing tasks on par with human domain experts whether it is driving a car or helping doctors diagnose disease. But make no mistake while we are starting to see the fruits of AI here and there: By and large, the industry and most organizations are still in the early days of AI adoption. And as with any new momentous technology, organizations need to develop an adoption strategy specific to their organization to get the full benefits of AI automation and deep learning technology. The complication as Gartner put it : “How to make AI a core IT competency still eludes most organizations.” But failing to learn how to leverage the benefits AI/ML will leave an organization at a competitive disadvantage in terms of customer experience and operational efficiency. So, what’s the way to get there? Here are three common traps that companies should steer clear of as they get themselves AI-ready. 1. Data and Mission vagueness Great wine requires good grapes and great AI starts with good data, but great AI also needs a clear business ROI. The business benefit ROI and the data needed to automate the domain expert task must be clearly defined at the outset of the project if the AI solution is to deliver real value and continue receiving the resources to grow from pilot to production. AI ingredients, like algorithms and machine learning, sound very science-y, but business AI projects should never resemble science experiments. The “Shiny New Toy Syndrome” is a real pitfall for AI. To avoid succumbing to it, organizations should tie every AI project to specific business outcomes and know the business outcome question and what task you are trying to do on par with a domain expert. For example, is the objective of using intelligent automation to relieve IT team members of mundane, routine tasks so they can focus on higher-value activities? Beyond the IT department, is it to help the marketing department gain competitive advantage by delivering more personalized experiences to customers? Is it automating more of the sales process to boost lead volume and close rate? C-suite leaders would have to be living under a rock at this point not to recognize AI’s potential and the fact that investment is required for AI-ready technology stacks, but they’re going to want to understand how it’s good for the business. Everyone in a company needs to recognize this reality, and ward off any squishiness in an AI project’s reason for being. 2. Lack of AI/ML skills in the company The AI talent shortage is often cited as one of the tech industry’s toughest challenges. It has even been called a national security threat amid China’s ambitions to become the world leader in AI. According to O’Reilly’s 2021 AI Adoption in the Enterprise report , which surveyed more than 3,500 business leaders, a lack of skilled people and difficulty hiring tops the list of AI challenges. To make sure their companies have the talent to fully leverage the benefits of AI/ML they should start both a hiring and training program. On the hiring side, companies should look for talent beyond the typical data science degree and look at adjacent degrees such as physics, math and self-taught computer science. But hiring talent is not enough for a companies’ strategy to build their AI workforces, especially when they’re competing with behemoths like Amazon and Facebook. Another good solution to consider: If you can’t hire them, train them. While it’s unreasonable to expect someone to become a data scientist after taking a couple of online Coursera classes. Engineers with Physics, Math and Computer Science backgrounds have the foundation to master data science and deep learning. Sources of talent may exist inside the organization in unexpected places. Take, for example, the large business intelligence (BI) ecosystems that many companies have. These have talent that is familiar with using Bayesian statistical analysis that is common to most machine learning algorithms. In making sure they have the right skills to support AI initiatives, it makes sense for companies to re-train existing employees as much as possible in addition to having an AI/ML hiring strategy. Companies need to get creative in pinpointing those employees and AI/ML talent. 3. Building rather than buying I’ve seen companies get bogged down by trying to build their own AI tools and solutions from scratch rather than buying them or leveraging open source. The algorithms being used to develop AI solutions are fast evolving and companies should look to partner with vendors in their industry who are leading the AI wave. Unless it happens to be one of the company’s core competencies, building AI solutions is usually an overreach. Why reinvent the wheel when you can buy one of the many commercial AI tools on the market? Deloitte’s most recent State of the AI in the Enterprise report , which surveyed 2,737 IT and line-of-business executives worldwide, found that “seasoned” and “skilled” AI adopters are more likely than “starters” to buy the AI systems they need. “This suggests that many organizations may go through a period of internal learning and experimentation before they know what’s necessary and then seek it from the market,” the report said. Companies that avoid these three traps will have a much easier time accelerating their AI adoption and enjoying the benefits of revenue growth, lower operating costs, and improved customer experience.

Data is the new oil and therefore, as a consequence data scientist is the most in-demand career in the market right now. The demand for data science abilities will rise as the sector matures with new-age technology and solutions. Businesses of all sizes are eager to use data to improve efficiencies, and as a result, they are always looking to hire someone who can collect, evaluate, and analyse data. Nevertheless, the supply does not meet the industry’s needs. The rise in demand can be attributed to the introduction of big data and the way data is generated and used by businesses today. Businesses will need data science personnel with specialised abilities to collect and analyse this massive amount of data. At the same time, organisations are constantly looking for ways to improve their customer experience through predictive analytics, and data scientists can help businesses understand their data and utilise it to forecast customer behaviour. However, there are certain unique reasons why data science professionals are in such short supply. Data Science- Scope: The discipline of data science is growing at an unprecedented rate, producing a great demand for talent in a variety of fields. Apart from the rapid growth of startups, many large firms and businesses have begun to incorporate data science into their heritage ecosystems in order to increase efficiency and revenues. There is a huge demand for skilled data scientists all around the world, especially in countries like India, which is quickly developing. In India, there is a vast array of data-related enterprises. Data science, data analytics, big data engineers, big data managers, and data architects are the most common employment options. To address these gaps, personnel must be well-versed in a variety of data-related technologies. While a one-month crash course in data science can be a wonderful place to start, if you want to pursue a career in the field, you must have a thorough understanding of the subject. Lack of Skill The learning curve for data science is quite steep. You need to master the underlying math, statistics, and computer science to be a full-fledged data scientist, not simply the Tensorflow or Keras syntax. Despite the fact that there is an influx of data scientists every year, there are very few people who have the necessary knowledge in the field. Most data scientists have formal degrees in computer science, statistics, or mathematics, which is unusual in a world of self-taught coders. In terms of institutions and boot camps offering degrees in data science, India is still lagging behind the United States. As a result, just a few people are informed about data science. More businesses are utilising data Because all firms nowadays are utilising the value of big data in order to make informed business decisions, one of the key reasons for the lack of data scientists in the industry is that all companies are exploiting the value of big data. The growing demand for analytics in businesses has resulted in a severe shortage of data scientists. Despite the fact that many people want to work in data science, there isn’t enough trained labour to fill the positions. The quantity of STEM graduates each year does not keep pace with the industry’s demand for data scientists. Small firms can get by with one software engineer and an analyst who can analyse data, but a large corporation will need a team of data professionals that includes not just programmers and engineers, but also data visualisation specialists and project coordinators. As a result the company’s existing data scientists are under increasing pressure to complete more projects and solve more business challenges. It is therefore critical for data science aficionados to enrol in data science boot camps, complete projects, and seek out additional resources in order to get the essential expertise to close the skill gap.

Database What is Apache Hadoop? Understanding Hadoop Ecosystem & Architecture By Surajdeep Singh September 9, 2021 Share Facebook Twitter Linkedin Email Print Data science is an interdisciplinary sphere of study that has gained traction over the years, given the sheer amount of data we produce on a daily basis — projected to be over 2.5 quintillion bytes of data. The field of study utilizes modern techniques and tools to extract useful information, find undiscovered patterns and make business resolutions from structured and unstructured data. As data science utilizes both structured and unstructured data, the data used for analysis can be obtained from an array of application domains and available in multiple formats. Data science tools are used to construct predictive models and generate meaningful information by extracting, processing, and analyzing structured and unstructured data. The primary goal of implementing data science software is to clean up and standardize data by uniting machine learning (ML), data analysis, statistics, and business intelligence (BI). With data science tools and techniques, you can easily determine the main cause of a problem by addressing the right questions, explore and study data, model various forms of data using algorithms and visualize and communicate results via graphs, dashboards, etc. Data science software like Apache Hadoop comes with pre-defined functions, a suite of tools and libraries. Apache Hadoop is one of the few data science tools you should have in your kit. What is Hadoop? Apache Hadoop is an open source software designed for reliable, distributed and scalable computing. The Hadoop software library is designed to scale to thousands of servers, each of which offers local computation and storage. Using simple programming models, you can process large sets of data across computer clusters in a distributed manner. The software solves complex computational tasks and data-intensive problems by dissecting large sets of data into chunks and sending them to computers with instructions. The Hadoop library does not depend on hardware resources to deliver high availability; all failures are detected and rectified at the application layer. Understanding the Apache Hadoop Ecosystem The Hadoop ecosystem consists of the following major components: HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) – HDFS is the backbone of the Hadoop ecosystem that is responsible for storing large sets of structured, semi-structured and unstructured data. With HDFS, you can store data across various nodes and maintain metadata. HDFS has two core components, NameNode and DataNode. A NameNode executes operations like opening, closing and changing the names of files and directories and the mapping of blocks to DataNodes. DataNodes on the other hand serve read and write requests from clients and perform block creation, deletion and replication upon instruction. YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) – YARN performs all processing activities by scheduling tasks and allocating resources and is essentially the brain of the Hadoop ecosystem. It consists of two primary components, ResourceManager and NodeManager. Resource Manager processes requests, divides large tasks into smaller tasks, and assigns these tasks to NodeManagers. NodeManagers are responsible for the execution of tasks on DataNodes. MapReduce – MapReduce is the primary component of processing in the Hadoop ecosystem, based on the YARN framework. It contains two main functions, Map() and Reduce (). Map() performs functions like sorting, grouping and filtering on data received as input to produce Tuples (key-value pairs). Reduce () aggregates and summarizes the Tuples produced by Map(). Apache PIG and Apache HIVE – Apache PIG works on the Pig Latin language, a query-based language that is similar to SQL. PIG is a platform for data structuring, processing and analyzing. Apache HIVE uses an SQL-like query language called HQL to read, write and manage large sets of data in a distributed environment. Apache Spark – Apache Spark is a framework written in Scala that handles all process consumptive jobs like iterative or interactive real-time processing, batch processing, visualization and graph conversions. Apache Mahout – Apache Mahout offers an environment for creating scalable ML applications. Its functions include frequent item set missing checks, classification, clustering and collaborative filtering. Apache HBase – Apache HBase is an open source NoSQL database that supports all types of data and is modeled after Google’s BigTable, thereby enabling effective handling of Big Data data sets. Hadoop Common – Hadoop Common provides standard libraries and functions that support Hadoop ecosystem modules. Other components of the Hadoop ecosystem include Apache Drill, Apache Zookeeper, Apache Oozie, Apache Flume, Apache Sqoop, Apache Ambari and Apache Hadoop Ozone. Understanding Apache Hadoop Architecture The Apache Hadoop framework consists of three major components: HDFS – HDFS follows a master/slave architecture. Each HDFS cluster has a solitary NameNode that serves as a master server and a number of serving DataNodes (usually one per node in the cluster). YARN – YARN performs job scheduling and resource management. ResourceManager receives jobs, divides jobs into smaller jobs and assigns these jobs to various slaves (DataNodes) in a Hadoop cluster. These slaves are managed by NodeManagers. NodeManagers ensure the execution of jobs on DataNodes. MapReduce – MapReduce works on the YARN framework and performs distributed processing in parallel in a Hadoop cluster. Using Apache Hadoop Apache Hadoop is a must-have data science tool. It offers all the provisions you need to process large sets of data. You can avail of the software for free and use its capabilities to create a tailored solution for your enterprise. Explore the Hadoop ecosystem in detail and learn about each of its components to build a solution of promise.

By Kim Martineau September 09, 2021 Columbia climate scientist Galen McKinley (left) and computer scientist Carl Vondrick Read More Columbia to Launch $25 Million AI-based Climate Modeling Center With funding from the National Science Foundation, Columbia is set to launch a new research center aimed at building the next generation of data-driven physics-based climate models. Current models agree that Earth will get warmer in the next few decades, but they disagree on how severe the effects will be, and what parts of the world will be hardest hit. With collaborators at other universities and national labs, Columbia researchers will update the models with new information gleaned from massive datasets and new machine-learning methods. The broader goal of the center, called Learning the Earth with AI and Physics, is to provide actionable information for societies to adapt to climate change and protect the most vulnerable. Columbia News caught up with the center’s deputy director, Galen McKinley, and its data science director, Carl Vondrick, to dig into the details. Q: How do global climate models currently work? What are their limitations? GALEN MCKINLEY: Climate models, also known as earth system models, work by representing the physics, chemistry, and biology of the climate system as mathematical equations. These equations are solved on a three-dimensional grid with cells representing the atmosphere, land, and ocean. We have no data for the future, and so the models draw from the scientific knowledge embedded in the equations to make their projections. Historical data are used to validate model simulations for the recent past, but are not directly used to guide the model. Most earth system models run on supercomputers, but they require even more computing power than we have available. This limits the size of the cells in our three-dimensional grid. In current models, a cell typically measures 60 miles on each side, with one value per cell representing a single variable like temperature, cloud cover, or rainfall. But, in the real world, these properties vary significantly over an area covering about 360 square miles! Researchers will improve on current climate models by using big data and machine learning to better represent small-scale processes, like cloud cover, and how they influence the climate system. Current models divide Earth into cells to project changes into the future; here’s what a cell representing the atmosphere might look like when greater detail is added through next-generation AI methods. (Image: Columbia University) A second limitation is that we don’t know how to write accurate equations for all the physical, chemical, and biological processes that influence climate. The equations we have are often based on field experiments from a few locations or points in time, and thus do not represent all conditions equally well. We tend to know physical equations better than biological equations, and research is ongoing to improve them. But we still have much to learn. Q: What existing machine-learning algorithms will you apply to the models to improve projections? CARL VONDRICK: The form of machine learning we are using, deep learning, achieves excellent performance when we have large amounts of data. The center will capitalize on this technology to better represent several climate processes like ocean turbulence or ice sheet flow in the models. One technique we’re particularly excited about is generative adversarial networks, or GANs, which will allow us to fill in data gaps with a high level of detail. We’re also excited to leverage techniques for equation discovery, allowing us to interpret the neural networks that underlie deep-learning algorithms to extract equations that may advance our understanding of Earth’s climate system. Q: You'll also be developing new algorithms. What questions will these AI tools address? CV: A key aim of the center is to deliver next-generation machine-learning technology for answering some of the unresolved questions in climate science. We’ve seen many exciting advances in AI lately, but there are still key obstacles to overcome. For example, current algorithms excel at identifying patterns in data, but they often make projections that violate basic laws of physics. Further, large datasets provide the best results, but for many physical and biological processes, collecting this much data is either impractical or too expensive. To solve these challenges, LEAP researchers will investigate how to deeply embed physical knowledge into state-of-the-art machine-learning models, thereby allowing systems to identify causal relationships, make do with less data, and reliably generalize to new situations. Q: Deep-learning algorithms can find patterns and correlations in big datasets but can't tease out cause and effect relationships. How would algorithms equipped with causal reasoning help to improve climate models? CV: Cause-and-effect reasoning is crucial for the models to capture why different physical and biological events happen. For a simple example, standard machine-learning methods tell us whether clouds and rain are related, but not much more. Machine learning with causal reasoning will tell us whether the clouds actually created the rain, and whether more clouds will create more rain. Embedding causality into the models will be pivotal for planning adaptation strategies to different climate processes. Q: Humanity is also unpredictable. It's unclear how much national economies will grow, and how much more greenhouse gases we'll pump into the air. The transition to clean energy could off-set some of our growth-related emission increases. How much does this uncertainty affect climate projections? GM: There is no doubt that our emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are driving climate change. The most important action we can take is to cut emissions as rapidly as possible. But carbon dioxide stays in the air for a long time, and thus any changes we make today to reduce emissions or remake our energy infrastructure won’t have much of an impact until at least 2050. In the meantime, we must adapt to the warming set in motion by current and future emissions. Our center is focused on making climate projections that can help guide the difficult decisions that will need to be made in the next few decades regarding climate adaptation. Right now, we’re focused on uncertainties in the models.

Project AI Off Earth will focus on the cutting edge of innovation in space. It will conduct modelling, emulation and simulation of complex space operations and systems; build algorithms for on-board satellite data processing; develop solutions for the remote operation and optimisation of satellites, constellations and swarms; and address space domain awareness and debris monitoring. The University of Adelaide's Australian Institute for Machine Learning is ranked among world leaders in the application of AI, computer vision and machine learning to real world problems. Microsoft has deep experience in advanced cloud computing and cognitive systems and is building Azure Space, a set of cloud offerings which allow organisations to leverage geospatial data, access anywhere bandwidth, digitally engineer space systems, and engage in remote edge computing  including in space. The University of Adelaide's Professor Tat-Jun Chin is the SmartSat CRC Professorial Chair of Sentient Satellites at the Australian Institute for Machine Learning. ""The relationship with Microsoft will give us access to cloud-based platforms that will allow us to focus on the investigation on the performance of algorithms used to analyse large amounts of earth-observation data from satellites, without needing to be concerned about gaining access to space at the onset,"" he says. ""Our work on these algorithms has the potential to contribute to many applications, including agricultural land management, water management, mining practices and understanding of economic activity among many other applications."" Chin says AIMLs vision is to be global leaders in machine learning research, and high impact research translation. ""To penetrate the global market we need to collaborate with international partners and this relationship with Microsoft presents the opportunity to do that,"" he says. Nicholas Moretti, Azure Space Engineer, Microsoft Australia adds, ""I first got exposed to the space industry while I was studying for my undergraduate degree at the University of Adelaide and crossed paths with Professor Chin. ""We are delighted to be working with AIML and believe this will help identify important opportunities to use these technologies and capabilities to support agriculture and ecology, economics and financial systems as well as the burgeoning space sector itself,"" he says. Although focused on in-space technologies, Project AI Off Earth will explore how space related technologies and data, and cognitive systems can be used to support automation of multiple different industries, help establish smart cities, as well as address sustainability and important environment challenges. AIML and Microsoft are already collaborating using Microsoft Azure Orbital Emulator a cloud-based native space emulation environment that enables massive satellite constellation simulations. Using Azure Orbital Emulator, AIML and Project AI Off Earth can quickly develop, evaluate, and train algorithms, machine learning models and AI intended for space without need to launch a single satellite. ""The University of Adelaide undertakes world-leading research in the space sector, as well as many other fields, which aims to find solutions to the challenges facing society,"" says the University of Adelaide's Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research) Professor Anton Middelberg. ""This exciting new relationship between the Australian Institute for Machine Learning and Microsoft will help AIMLs expertise to have an impact on a truly global scale."" The collaboration comes at a time of soaring interest in the space-related economy; the Australian Space Agency's goal is to triple the space sectors contribution to GDP to $12 billion and create an additional 20,000 jobs by 2030. South Australian Minister for Trade and Investment, Stephen Patterson adds, ""Adelaide has established itself as the very heart of Australias space industry. ""This agreement between AIML and Microsoft, which is building a space team, is a signal of whats to come. Australia has the opportunity to be a leading player in the global space industry and this sort of international collaboration centred on Adelaide but with a truly global focus will strengthen the local industry, help build skills in this important area and reinforce Adelaides reputation as the epicentre of space activity in this part of the world,"" he says. AIML and Microsoft Azure Space also intend to use Project AI Off Earth to advocate for STEM careers, to advise on structuring of STEM traineeships and scholarships, and to encourage greater participation by women, underprivileged groups, and underrepresented groups.

Atkins, D-San Diego , Thursday appointed San Diego City Councilman Sean Elo-Rivera and two others to serve on the governing board of the Cradle-to-Career Data System. The system links information across spectrums like education and social services in an effort to “better equip policymakers, educators and the public to address disparities and improve student outcomes,” a statement from Atkins’ office read. “The Cradle-to-Career Data System is an essential tool in crafting the policies and support services that will give Californians a head start as they navigate the education system and enter the workforce,” Atkins said. “I took special care to appoint experts in data systems, youth development and public policy so that the best of the best are helping guide this important program.” Get Times of San Diego Daily by Email Subscribe By clicking subscribe, you agree to share your email address with Times of San Diego to receive a free newsletter with the latest local news delivered at 8 a.m. daily.

Processing… Elo-Rivera was elected to the San Diego City Council in November 2020. Previously, he served as the executive director of Youth Will and as a trustee for the San Diego Community College District. Atkins said Elo-Rivera was a natural fit for the governing board given his expertise and long-time commitment to working with students. “A trusted community leader and youth advocate, Councilmember Sean Elo-Rivera has dedicated his life’s work to youth development and empowerment,” she said. “As the governing board develops and implements the Cradle-to-Career Data System, Councilmember Elo-Rivera’s experience as a San Diego Community College District Board Trustee will be an essential resource for ensuring the database is a source for actionable data and research that will help guide decisions and provide future generations with the tools they need for success.” Along with Elo-Rivera, Atkins appointed Sen. John Laird, D-Santa Cruz, and Dr. Meredith Lee — who currently serves as chief technical advisor for computing, data science, and society at University of California, Berkeley. The Senate’s two public members will serve an initial two-year term on the Cradle-to-Career governing board and receive per diem and reimbursement for travel. –City News Service Support Times of San Diego With the generous support of readers like you, Times of San Diego publishes timely and accurate news coverage for a better-informed community.

The buildings will be terraced into the hillside between Prospect Avenue and Ivy Lane. This architect’s rendering shows the west entrance of the proposed complex. Image courtesy of Ennead Architects LLP/bloomimages From addressing climate change to developing new ways of delivering vaccines , Princeton’s proposed engineering and environmental studies project will enable breakthrough teaching and research in the service of humanity while enhancing the public experience of the surrounding neighborhood. The University plans to build a new home for Environmental Studies (ES) and the School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS) between Ivy Lane and Prospect Avenue. The four buildings — environmental science, bioengineering, chemical and biological engineering, and an engineering commons — will create a new ES + SEAS neighborhood carefully integrated into the surrounding landscape with strong connections to outdoor spaces. The buildings will include state-of-the-art teaching, research and collaboration facilities for seven academic departments, institutes and centers. The four buildings — environmental science, bioengineering, chemical and biological engineering, and an engineering commons — will create a new ES + SEAS neighborhood carefully integrated into the surrounding landscape with strong connections to outdoor spaces. This rendering shows an aerial view of the proposed buildings, which will create a neighborhood that more closely connects engineering and environmental studies with the rest of campus to foster collaboration with the natural sciences, humanities, public policy and other disciplines. Image courtesy of Ennead Architects LLP/bloomimages SEAS Dean Andrea Goldsmith said the new facilities are essential to conducting research that has tremendous benefits to human health and society — including work addressing climate change and carbon sequestration, new pharmaceuticals and vaccines, better processes for the production of new materials, and greater energy efficiency. The new buildings also will further environmental science studies that are crucial to learning about and mitigating global challenges related to biodiversity, conservation, climate, energy, and environmental policy. “We are at a point where the current facilities for engineering are 60 years old. They are no longer sufficient to do the groundbreaking research that we want to accomplish,” said Goldsmith, the Arthur LeGrand Doty Professor of Electrical Engineering. “The reason that Princeton Engineering needs to grow is that engineering has changed. In the last decades, engineering has become much more interdisciplinary. It is solving much more complex problems that require a broader set of expertise, of disciplinary and interdisciplinary expertise.” Goldsmith said that the neighborhood’s central location is critical to convene expertise across the sciences, humanities and public policy. “All the richness of ideas we need to solve the problems we face. This project is really about maximizing our impact and delivering on Princeton's motto to benefit humanity, through engineering and technology,"" she added. The project reflects the importance of environmental studies and engineering in a 21st century liberal arts university. The buildings will create a neighborhood that more closely connects engineering and environmental studies with the rest of the University’s campus, including the new home for the Department of Computer Science . The proximity of key collaborators in different departments also amplifies connections between the growing fields of bioengineering, data science and environmental research and creates a center of gravity for convening diverse experts and innovators across and beyond the University to address critical societal needs. “It is really designed around connectivity,"" said University Architect Ronald McCoy. The new buildings, all connected underground in one continuous sequence, will maintain distinct identities for disciplines while allowing for strong connections among them. “When we spoke to the faculty they were really clear: 'We need better space and we need more of it.' These are state-of-the-art, flexible, and highly functional teaching and research spaces,” McCoy said. Athanassios (Thanos) Panagiotopoulos, chair of the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, said the new teaching, research, lab and collaboration spaces are “absolutely critical to the mission of the University to serve society by addressing urgent needs.” “Our department’s work is about mitigating climate change, creating new chemical processes that will allow us to replace fossil fuels with renewables, and giving us the tools to address public health and wellbeing,” said Panagiotopoulos, the Susan Dod Brown Professor of Chemical and Biological Engineering. “The technologies that enable the Covid vaccines to become quickly, widely and safely available -- the ability to protect those tiny mRNA packages – uses technology that chemical engineers have developed.” The ES + SEAS project is also a model of the University’s sustainability ethos. The complex meets or exceeds Princeton sustainability standards and will seek LEED certification. It will feature geo-exchange heating and cooling, a green roof, high performance exteriors, rainwater harvesting and sustainable materials. The design also reflects the University’s strong commitment to being a steward of buildings and landscapes while pursuing critical opportunities for innovation, creativity and benefit to society. The buildings will be terraced into the hillside between Prospect Avenue and Ivy Lane currently occupied by faculty and staff housing and parking lots behind eating club buildings. As part of the project’s careful, thoughtful planning and design process, the University is planning to relocate the Office of the Dean for Research building at 91 Prospect Avenue to across the street, allowing for it to remain part of a vibrant Prospect Avenue. The neighborhood will include sunken courtyards and extensive pedestrian paths and outdoor spaces for the public and community. The complex also includes public display spaces for interaction with school groups and the community, as well as lecture halls for public outreach and engagement. This architect’s rendering shows the Prospect Avenue entry of the proposed ES + SEAS neighborhood. The ES + SEAS project is also a model of the University’s sustainability ethos and sustainable building standards.

Log In All Posts Research Results Data Sets Applications and Modeling Tools Commentaries and Articles Search Jeffrey Morris 4 days ago 20 min read What do new Israeli data say about effect of vaccines & boosters vs. death/critical/severe disease? Updated: 9 hours ago Key Points: I downloaded and analyzed data containing daily COVID-19 deaths and critical infection numbers from the Israeli ministry of health dashboard from August 10 and September 8, overall and split out by <60yr and >60yr, to assess effectiveness of boosters and vaccination without boosters relative to unvaccinated. Because of age confounding, it is crucial to stratify by age groups, and further to remove children from the <60yr group; otherwise Simpson's paradox makes vaccines look like they are not effective in protecting against COVID-19 deaths at all. After doing this adjustment, we see the vaccines and boosters are strongly protecting against both COVID-19 deaths and critical infections. For the >60 population, we see ~70% effectiveness for vaccinated, which increases to >93% for boosted, agreeing with other public reports showing boosters reducing serious cases in the older population. For the 12yr-60yr population, we see ~90% effectiveness for vaccinated, whether boosted or not. However, there may still be a remaining ""Simpson's effect"" attenuating the estimated effectiveness of boosters in the 12yr-60yr group, since most boosted are in the 40-60yr group that has higher risk of death and critical disease, so the effectiveness of boosters might in fact be >>90%. One limitation of these data are that the Israeli MoH did not separate out previously infected.  These may comprise a substantial proportion of unvaccinated, especially in the older groups, which may lead to additional attenuation of effectiveness estimates. Overall, these data agree with what we have seen in all careful analyses of vaccine data: that even with Delta and with some waning immune protection after some time, the vaccines are still strongly protecting against severe, critical, and fatal disease. Boosters provide further protection but it is not yet clear whether they are necessary for the younger age groups. In a previous blog post , I highlighted two key quantitative points that often confuse people when looking at COVID-19 data for vaccinated and unvaccinated populations: It is meaningless to consider ""percent of cases/hospitalizations/deaths"" that are vaccinated without accounting for what percentage of the population is vaccinated.  This can easily be done by normalizing the counts of cases/hospitalizations/deaths based on the overall number vaccinated or not in the population, but many fail to make this basic adjustment. With observational data, the failure to account for confounding factors that are associated with both exposure (vaccination status) and outcome (cases/hospitalizations/deaths) can produce misleading results, sometimes dramatically misleading if the confounding is strong enough.  In the previous post, ""age"" was the confounding factor. ""full vaccination"" the exposure, and ""severe disease"" the outcome, with older people much more likely both to be vaccinated as well as to have severe disease, causing the paradoxical result of vaccine effectiveness appearing much lower when computed overall (67.5%) than when computed separately by age groups (91.8% for <50yr, 85.2% for >50yr), illustrating a statistical artifact known as Simpson's Paradox . The data analyzed in that post were downloaded from Israel's Ministry of Health (MoH) dashboard and comprised of all ""currently active serious COVID-19 cases"" as of August 15, 2021.  These data provided a snapshot of active serious cases at that time, and the analysis involved an assessment of how the rates differed among vaccinated or unvaccinated.  The dashboard did not contain information on COVID-19 deaths or critical cases, it did not contain data over a longer period of time, and  it did not contain information on 3rd shot boosters that had just started being distributed on August 1. This 3rd shot booster program, initially limited to immunocompromised and older residents, has now been made available to all adult Israeli residents, and in fact an Israeli resident whose second shot was >5 months ago is not considered ""fully vaccinated"" unless they have received the 3rd shot booster . Recently, the MoH has updated the dashboard to include daily counts of deaths, new serious cases, and new critical cases, on September 9 sharing data containing daily counts from August 10, 2021 through September 8, 2021 split out by boosted , vaccinated but not boosted , and unvaccinated. These data contain both raw counts and normalized ""counts per 100k"" from which the denominators (total population boosted, vaccinated, or unvaccinated) can be inferred, plus they report both overall counts as well as split out by age group (<60, >60).   Because they contain data over a fixed time period, these data enable estimation of effectiveness of vaccine and/or booster summarizing difference in rates for unvaccinated and vaccinated for that period of time, rather than for just a snapshot of currently active cases like the previous analysis, plus enables evaluation of difference in rates for those boosted vs. those fully vaccinated but not yet boosted.   I have downloaded and collated these data together to assess what they can tell us about vaccine effectiveness (VE) vs. deaths, critical cases, or severe cases of COVID-19 for boosters, as well as for vaccination without boosters.  The links to the data sets and transparent explanations for my calculations are provided at the end of this article. As we will see, the same tricky quantitative nuances highlighted in the previous post are evident here for all three outcomes, so once again this post serves as a warning to be careful not to misinterpret simple summaries of the data, and to be sure to stratify by age to avoid the Simpson's paradox effect caused by strong age confounding that also is present for these outcomes. Warning : the initial tables make it appear that the vaccines and boosters are ""not working"" at preventing COVID-19 deaths, but please be sure to see the later tables that show once age is accounted for reasonably well the vaccines and boosters seem to be doing well in reducing risk of COVID-19 death. Also, I must start with a disclaimer: While the following analysis is legitimate and the best I can do with the publicly available data on the MoH dashboard, I do not consider this to be a state-of-the-art analysis that is the end-all indicator of VE vs. death, critical disease, or severe disease in Israel, or effects of boosters.  There are other important confounders other than age that should be accounted for but were not available in this data set, there are some questions about how previously infected or partially vaccinated were handled in this data set that may require additional adjustment, plus there is uncertainty about whether the recorded dates are date of event (death, hospitalization, ICU entry) or date of positive PCR test that shades precise interpretation.  Someone with access to more complete data could do a much more complete and careful analysis with more advanced modeling, as has been done in excellent papers by various research groups inside of Israel.  In spite of these limitations, I think this analysis has value not just for further illustrating how statistical nuances can distort proper interpretation of these types of data, but also in providing some information about how the vaccines and boosters appear to be impacting advanced outcomes like severe disease, critical disease, and deaths. Effectiveness of Vaccination and Boosters against COVID-19 Deaths I will start by focusing on the COVID-19 death data, to assess the estimated effectiveness of the booster and of vaccination without booster in preventing COVID-19 deaths relative to the unvaccinated group during this period of time. Following are the total COVID-19 deaths for unvaccinated ( Not Vax ), Boosted ( Boost , meaning they have received a 3rd shot booster), and vaccinated but not boosted ( Vax (NB) ) combining the counts from August 10 through September 8. We see a total of 667 COVID-19 deaths during that time period, with only 41.5% (277) in the unvaccinated group, 12.5% in the boosted group, and 46.0% in the vaccinated but not boosted group.  Thus, we see ~60% of COVID-19 deaths were at least fully vaccinated.  These raw proportions do not paint a promising picture for the effectiveness of vaccines or boosters, but we know better than to interpret these raw numbers alone without accounting for proportion vaccinated and boosted, right?  The MoH data set does not explicitly contain total number boosted, unvaccinated, or vaccinated but not boosted, but for various outcomes they include both raw numbers as well as normalized numbers per 100k population from which these raw numbers can be inferred as detailed at the end of this article.  Since these numbers change every day as more people are vaccinated or boosted, for simplicity in this table we include the average numbers in each category over the period of August 10 through September 8: We can see that looking across the entire Israeli population, during this time period we have an average of 62% vaccinated, with 13.2% already given 3rd shot booster and 48.8% being fully vaccinated but not yet receiving 3rd shot booster. Given these total number boosted, unvaccinated, and vaccinated but not yet boosted, we can normalize the number of deaths in each group based on number per 100k population. For example, we have 83 deaths in the boosted group from a population of 1,200,310 boosted, which means that in the time period of August 10 through September 8, the proportion of boosted who died of COVID-19 is 83/1,200,310   =  0.0000691. As these small numbers are hard to interpret, we can multiply this rate times 100,000 by shifting the decimal place 5 places to get B = ""rate of COVID-19 deaths per 100k among boosted."" as 6.91, meaning that from August 10 through September 8, 6.91 out of every 100k boosted died of COVID-19. We can do the same for N = ""rate of COVID-19 deaths per 100k among unvaccinated"" and V = ""rate of COVID=19 deaths per 100k among vaccinated but not boosted"" B = 83/1,200,310 x 100,000 = 6.91 per 100k V = 307/4,446,814 x 100,000 = 6.90 per 100k N = 277/3,456,060 x 100,000 = 8.01 per 100k. Note that these numbers are proportion of the respective populations who die from a COVID-19 infection, not proportion of those with COVID-19 infection who die.  The latter proportion is called the case fatality rate , which would be an interesting number to look at as well, but a number we can't estimate here without counts of confirmed COVID-19 cases in these groups and to be more precise, matching of cases and deaths. Based on these normalized rates, we can compute vaccine effectiveness vs. COVID-19 death for boosted and for vaccinated (not boosted) relative to the unvaccinated for this time period: VE_death for boosters: 	1 - B / N =  1 - 6.91/8.01  = 13.7% VE_death for Vax (NB): 	1 - V / N =  1 - 6.90/8.01  = 13.7% Ugh.  This does not look good.  A 13.7% effectiveness vs. COVID-19 deaths would suggest that the boosters (or vaccines without boosters) are only preventing 13.7% of the COVID-19 deaths that would have occurred without vaccination or boosters.  If this reflected reality, this would be truly alarming as it would suggest that neither the vaccines nor even the boosters are substantially reducing the risk of death by COVID-19. However, please don't stop reading here and go away convinced the ""vaccines don't work"" Just as it was for severe disease in our previous analysis, age is a major confounding factor here: Older people are much more likely to be boosted (or vaccinated but not boosted) than younger people. Older people are inherently much more likely to die if they get COVID-19 than younger people. In fact, one would expect age to be an even stronger confounder here, since the disparate risk of death between young and old is even greater for deaths than severe disease, and the disparity in rates of boosters between young and old are even greater at this point in time than the rates of vaccination.  Could it be that these overall effectiveness numbers are distorted by a Simpson's paradox effect involving age once again?  Fortunately the MoH data is split out by age (they use 60 as cutpoint so we have  the data split out by <60 and >60).  Here are the counts and normalized counts for boosters and vaccination without boosters split out by the two age groups: We can see the vast majority of deaths are from the >60 group, with 254/277=91.6% of unvaccinated deaths, 82/83=98.8% of boosted deaths, and 298/307=97.1% of vaccinated (no booster) deaths in those >60yr. Here, the the normalized rates of COVID-19 deaths per 100k in the unvaccinated group is >230x higher in the >60 than <60 group, clearly showing the risk of death from COVID-19 is MUCH higher for older than that is for younger people (which we already knew, of course).  From these numbers, we can compute age-specific effectiveness estimates for boosters and vaccination (no booster). Note that the vaccine effectiveness numbers split out by age are much higher than the overall numbers without age stratification, suggesting once again a strong Simpson's effect. These results suggest that for both the younger and older age groups, >2/3 of COVID-19 deaths that would have occurred sans vaccination were prevented by full vaccination even without boosters. For the >60yr, this protection appears to be substantially stronger in the older group, with an estimated  5.2-fold reduction { (1-0.68)/(1-0.938) } = 5.2 } in risk of death with the boosted group relative to vaccinated but not boosted.  This number agrees with some of the published papers (see here and here ) in terms of effectiveness of boosters in reducing breakthrough infections and severe cases in the first few weeks after the booster program began, and provides some preliminary support that the booster program may help reduce risk of severe outcomes in older groups. We do not see evidence of reduced risk of death from COVID-19 from boosters in the younger (<60yr) group, but note that only 5% of this age group has received boosters, they received the boosters more recently, and there is only a single death so far in this cohort, so there is really not enough data yet to make a strong determination of this effect. While these age-stratified VE_death numbers are much higher than the unstratified numbers (13.7%), the numbers for the <60yr group both with boosters (62.7%) and without (66.6%) would comprise a substantial waning of protection vs. COVID-19 death relative to the previously reported >90% numbers. Please don't stop reading here either -- this is also not the final story. However, there are caveats and uncertainties in these data that we need to consider when trying to interpret these results.  Note the total number unvaccinated, boosted, and vaccinated but not boosted computed from these data sum to 9,103,184, which is roughly the entire Israeli population.  This raises a number of questions. Unlike the data used in the previous blog post that only Israeli residents >12yr, these data  clearly include all Israeli residents, including small children , and since vaccination is not yet available for any of those <12yr, these should be completely contained in the unvaccinated group.  Since children have exceptionally low risks of deaths from COVID-19, failure to separate this group out would severely distort the effectiveness numbers for the <60yr cohort as illustrated below. It is not clear how this dashboard counts partially vaccinated , which would include those who have either received only a single dose of vaccine or are within 7 days of their second dose.  These are either included in the Vax (NB) or Not Vax counts, but I have not been able to find documentation of which one.  If they are included in the vaccinated group, this would attenuate the vaccine effectiveness under the condition that a single dose provides less protection than a two-dose regimen, as is clear in other published data. It is also not clear how the previously infected are counted in this table.  Israel did not make vaccination available to those previously infected until March 2021, and then only offered a single dose, and this was optional, since previously infected were given ""green pass"" immune passports whether vaccinated or not.  As a result, a substantial proportion of previously infected may remain unvaccinated, and these are likely included in the Not Vax group.  Since we know that most previously infected retain robust immune protection , the failure to remove or stratify out the previously infected in these data has the potential to attenuate vaccine or booster effectiveness data.  Note that most published papers on Israeli data that perform rigorous modeling remove these previously infected, but the dashboard does not provide this information so I was not able to remove them here. These factors might have a strong impact on the effectiveness estimates.  While I can't do anything about the partially vaccinated or previously infected with the information available to me here, we can try to separate out the <12yr old population from the <60yr numbers in the table. There are other data sets shared on the dashboard that only include numbers for >12yr (including the one in the previous post) that suggest a total population >12yr of 6,876,056.   Subtracting from the 9,105,184 total here, we get an estimated 2,229,128 Israeli residents <12yr in these data.  Given children <12yr have not been eligible for vaccination yet, all of these are among the 3,300,794 unvaccinated in the <60yr group.    We see 23 unvaccinated COVID-19 deaths in the <60 age group.  While the MoH doesn't split out how many of these deaths are from individuals <12yr, it is clear from other data that the risk for death from COVID-19 is orders of magnitude less for children <12yr than adults 50-59, 40-49, or even 30-39.  Based on this, we expect none of these deaths are in the <12yr group, or at most 1.    So if we assume no COVID-19 deaths <12yr and pull out the children into their own age category, we see: Note that >2/3 of the unvaccinated individuals (2,229,128/3,300,794)  in the <60yr group and >64% of the total unvaccinated in the population (2,229,128/3,456,060) are children <12yr.   Given the lack of deaths in this cohort, we see that the normalized rates per 100k in the unvaccinated group for adults 12-60yr increase substantially when the children are separated out. While the rate of unvaccinated COVID-19 deaths in the full <60yr group was 0.70 per 100k, when the children <12yr are separated out, the rate of unvaccinated COVID-19 deaths in the 12-60yr group more than triples to 2.15 per 100k (even if we assume 1 of the COVID-19 deaths was in the <12yr group this number still increases to 2.05).  Thus, if we recompute the effectiveness of vaccines/boosters in preventing COVID-19 deaths further sub-stratifying the children out of the <60yr group, we get the following numbers: When we split the children out from the <60yr group, we see that the effectiveness of the booster in reducing the rate of COVID-19 deaths relative to unvaccinated is 87.9%, much closer to the 93.8% we saw in the >60yr group.    Further, this 12-60yr fully vaccinated age group seems to have been strongly protected vs. COVID-19 death during this time period, even without boosting, with effectiveness of 89.3% suggesting that full vaccination prevents ~90% of COVID-19 deaths that would have occurred in this age group sans vaccination. This high effectiveness was obscured in the combined <60yr analysis, since the systematic differences between the <12yr group and 12-60yr groups with respect to both the exposure (vaccination/booster) rates and outcome (risk of COVID-19 death) rates induce another Simpson Effect , and leads to greatly attenuated effectiveness estimates if we pool these groups together. It appears that the failure to separate out the <12yr children contributed even more strongly to the low overall 13.7% effectiveness numbers than the failure to split into >60yr/<60yr, since the ""overall"" effectiveness vs. death for the >12yr combined group (69.4% for vaccinated, boosted or not) is much higher. Thus, it is absolutely critical to separate children out as their own stratum when assessing vaccine effectiveness vs. COVID-19 related events. Conclusions from COVID-19 Death Analysis: These data affirm the points made in the previous blog post: that it is crucial to stratify by a strong confounding factor such as age when estimating vaccine (or booster) effectiveness vs. COVID-related events to avoid Simpson's paradox induced distortions, and these data further illustrate how crucial it is to further separate out children into their own stratum. Thus, our final analysis of these data stratify into 3 age groups (<12yr, 12yr-60yr, >60yr).  In the older >60yr group, we see higher VE_death for boosters than those fully vaccinated who have not received boosters yet.   This agrees with a medRXiv paper from Israeli researchers presenting a rigorous analysis that shows that based on the first few weeks' data, the boosters greatly reduce risk of severe infections for older subjects.  Apparently, in this older group, the  observed waning immunity (also shown by this same group in a different medRXiv paper ) extends to reduced protection vs. advanced outcomes like severe disease and death.  This provides some support for the use of boosters in the older population, since it seems the extra flurry of circulating neutralizing antibodies induced by the booster may be effective in reducing risk of severe disease and death for this cohort. The effectiveness numbers for >60yr vs serious illness, critical disease, and death (~70%) is considerably lower than what was seen by Israeli groups who removed previously infected from the unvaccinated and adjusted for other confounders, with 91% effectiveness vs serious disease for those vaccinated more recently and 86% for those vaccinated back in January or February.  it is possible our numbers are attenuated by the inclusion of previously infected, especially in the unvaccinated  group. https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.24.21262423v1 However, for the younger 12yr-60yr group, we see high effectiveness in preventing COVID-19 death in the vaccinated group, whether boosted or not.   With only 7.2% boosted in this age group and their booster shots being so recent, we do not yet have substantial evidence in these data to evaluate the effect of boosters. However, there is likely another latent Simpson's effect in the data for this age group.  Given that most of those 7.2% boosted are in the older age groups, 40-59yr, and this age group has much higher risk for COVID-19 death than those 12-39yr, it is plausible that the effectiveness of boosters vs. COVID-19 deaths or critical disease is >>90%.  Since the MoH dashboard does not split out in such fine age groups, we can't tell from these data.  While it is possible that once we have more complete data, we will see a further reduction in risk of COVID-19 death in younger adults with booster, during this time period, it appears adults 12yr-60yr are strongly protected vs. COVID-19 death by vaccination (~90%), whether boosted or not. Also, since this age group was vaccinated more recently the >60yr group, it is possible that the ""waning"" effect observed in the older Israeli residents has not kicked in yet but later will, further reducing the protection of 2-dose vaccination vs. COVID-19 deaths and possibly making boosters necessary to restore the same protection.  However, since adults 40+ had access to vaccines starting January 19, and 16+ starting February 1 , which is 6-7 months before this time period, it seems like many of the adults 16yr-60yr had been fully vaccinated >5m before this time period so should have begun to experience any potential waning effect. While it is possible that we will see stronger booster effects even in the younger age groups once we have more complete data on boosters in this age group and more time for immune protection from the first two shots to potentially wane,  it is still not clear to me whether a booster is needed to retain strong protection against COVID-19 death (or as we see later, against severe or critical disease) for the younger age groups -- data from the next couple months should tell us a lot as a higher proportion of this group receives 3rd shot boosters. While these data are interesting to evaluate in light of decisions to roll out boosters or not, it is important not to draw firm conclusions given the short period of time since the booster program started, the small number of boosted in the younger adult age groups, and the time it takes for advanced outcomes like COVID-19 deaths to manifest.  Nonetheless, these data show that vaccination, with or without boosting, still provides substantial protection vs. death from COVID-19, and any narrative suggesting the vaccines are not effectively preventing COVID-19 deaths is countered by these data. Effectiveness of Vaccination and Boosters against Critical COVID-19 Infections I performed these same analyses for the MoH data on what they call ""critical COVID-19 infections.""  It is unclear to me how they define this, but it appears to be something very strict like ICU admissions given the relatively low numbers, comparable to the COVID-19 death numbers.  Here are the numbers for critical COVID-19 disease: We once again see a strong Simpson's effect with age, in that the estimated effectiveness vs. critical disease for both age groups are much higher than the overall number.  And, one again, the inclusion of children <12yrs in the <60yr group can also distort those numbers. Again it is not clear how many of the 195 unvaccinated critical cases in the <60yr group were <12yr, but given other data showing the risk of critical disease is so much less for <12 than others in the 30-60yr groups, it is likely safe to assume there are very few.  Here we have assumed zero, but if you would like to see how the numbers would change if you assume a different number of critical cases in unvaccinated <12yr, it is straightforward to recompute the numbers given these changes. Here are the numbers with children separated out, assuming for now no critical COVID-19 cases in children. Similarly,  we see the effectiveness estimates for the younger adult group greatly increase when the children are stratified out. Overall, these data suggest very strong protection against critical COVID-19 disease in the 12yr-60yr group, with or without boosters, and for the >60yr group, the protection seems clearly stronger with boosters. Effectiveness of Vaccination and Boosters against Serious COVID-19 Infections Next we repeated these analyses for ""severe cases.""  Again, it is not clear exactly how the MoH defines this, but it seems to include hospitalized cases as well as cases with certain advanced symptoms like very low pulseox.  There are many more events in this group than the critical disease group.  Here are the numbers for serious COVID-19 disease: Once again, we see a strong Simpson's effect for age. Here are the numbers with children separated out, assuming for now no serious COVID-19 cases in children (it is likely there are some serious cases in the <12yr age group, but again this should comprise a very small proportion of the total in the <60yr group -- and please feel free to recompute with different assumptions on number of serious cases in unvaccinated <12yr): We also see very strong protection against serious COVID-19 disease in the 12-60yr group, with or without boosters, and for the >60yr group, the protection seems clearly stronger with boosters. All of these data are consistent, suggesting the vaccines continue to provide strong protection  vs. severe disease, critical disease or COVID-19 death. For the older >60yr group, we see substantial protection vs. severe disease, critical disease or COVID-19 death from vaccination even with boosters (~70%), but this protection appears to have waned from the earlier reported numbers of >90%.  However, a substantial proportion of this age group has already received boosters, and these have restored protection vs. severe disease, critical disease or death to very high levels (~93-96%) demonstrating a 4-fold to 6-fold reduction of risk of severe disease, critical disease, or COVID-19 deaths.  Even though little time has passed since the booster program started, this provide support for their use in the older adult age group, especially at this time when the current Delta surge leads to high risk of exposure for this vulnerable population. For the younger 12yr-60yr age group, we see vaccination provides a very high level of protection (~90%) vs. severe disease, critical disease, or COVID-19 death, whether boosted or not.  These data do not provide any support for the benefit of boosters in these age groups, but given the low proportion boosted so far and the potential of a remaining Simpson's effect attenuating the estimated booster effectiveness numbers in this analysis , it is possible that as more time passes later data could reveal boosters provide a further reduction of risk. Data and Details of Calculation: I downloaded the data for this post from the Israeli MoH dashboard on September 9, 2021.  The datasets I downloaded include: Daily COVID-19 deaths from August 10 - September 8: Israel deaths Aug10-Sept8 .xlsx Download XLSX • 12KB This spreadsheet was downloaded on the MoH dashboard from the section that is on the left side, second last section from the bottom. Daily serious and critical cases from August 10 - September 8: Israel new daily severe and critical Aug10 to Sept8 .xlsx Download XLSX • 15KB This data set was downloaded from the top middle section of the MoH dashboard. Daily number vaccinated from August 10 - September 8: daily vaccination numbers downloaded .xlsx Download XLSX • 13KB This data set was downloaded from the top right section of the MoH dashboard. All three of these data sets have the same format: date, age group (overall, <60, >60), and raw counts of the variable (death, vaccination, severe case, critical case) split by unvaccinated, boosted, and vaccinated (not boosted), as well as normalized counts per 100k.  I could not find documentation for the MoH definition of ""severe"" and ""critical"" disease, but based on the numbers it seems ""critical"" is likely ICU stays and ""severe"" a much broader category that includes hospitalizations or perhaps also including other severe symptoms (e.g. very low blood oxygen levels). For some strange reason the ordering of rows by age group is not consistent within or between spreadsheets, so it required care to collate these data sets together into a common spreadsheet. I split the rows into 3 sections: overall, <60, and >60, and within each section each row was 1 day between Aug10 and Sept8.    From these collated data, I did the following calculations: 1. Inferring of total numbers unvaccinated/boosted/vaccinated-not-boosted per day: These numbers were not provided on the dashboard (as far as I could tell), but they could be inferred from the downloaded tables since each provided both raw counts and normalized counter per 100k for all outcomes, vaccination categories, age groups, and dates.    For example, on September 6, the ""vaccinations"" spreadsheet reports a raw count of 412 in the ""boosted"" column with corresponding normalized rate of 19.1 in the ""boosted per 100k"" column.  From this, based on some simple algebra based reversing the equation above for computing rates per 100k,  we can infer the total boosted population on September 6: Total boosted population on Sept6 = 412*100,000/19.1 = 2,157,068 To check the math, you can see 412 out of a population of 2,157,068 yields a proportion of 412/2,157,068 = 0.000191, which when shifting the decimal place 5 places to the right corresponds to a normalized rate of 19.1 per 100k. This can be repeated for all days, age groups (all/<60/>60), and vaccination categories (boosted/unvaccinated/vaccinated but not yet boosted) to get corresponding daily counts in the population.  We could compute this from any of the outcomes (deaths, severe cases, critical cases, vaccinations), and if you do this within the attached spread",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

heets, you will see that they all yield similar population level results, subject to differential rounding errors since the rates per 100k are rounded to 1 decimal place.  Thus," we used the data from the  """"daily vaccinations"""" spreadsheet to compute the population numbers", since these had the largest daily raw counts of all the outcomes and thus least affected by roundoff error and most accurate. 2. Estimating average population numbers over the August 10 - September 8 time period Given that more people are vaccinated and boosted every day, the total number of boosted, unvaccinated, and vaccinated-not-boosted change from day to day.  To compute effectiveness numbers, I averaged each of these numbers over all of the days in the time period, separately by age group," and used these numbers as """"population numbers"""" reported in the tables. 3. Computing overall raw counts normalized rates/100k for each outcome/vaccination group For each outcome (death", severe disease, critical disease) and vaccine group, I summed the counts over all days to get the raw numbers of each outcome to put into the table, and divided by the average population numbers in those categories to get the normalized rates per 100k for the table.  These normalized rates were then used to compute the vaccine effectiveness numbers for boosters or vaccination-without-boosters as described above.  This was repeated for each age group (overall, <60, >60). Following is the analysis data set that includes the collated data and results after all of these calculations," and contains all of the numbers required to generate the tables presented above. collated Israel vaccines deaths severe critical cases - daily Aug10-Sept8 .xlsx Download XLSX • 62KB 0 views 0 comments Post not marked as liked ©2020 by Covid Data Science.

Gartner analysts predict that numerous AI initiatives will move quickly from the first stage of the hype cycle to the final one over the next two to five years. Image: Gartner Users want more than artificial intelligence can provide at the moment but those capabilities are changing fast, according to Gartner's Hype Cycle for Artificial Intelligence 2021 report. Gartner analysts described 34 types of AI technologies in the report and also noted that the AI hype cycle is more fast-paced, with an above-average number of innovations reaching mainstream adoption within two to five years. Gartner analysts found more innovations in the innovation trigger phase of the hype cycle than usual. That means that end users are looking for specific technology capabilities that current AI tools can't quite deliver yet. Synthetic data, orchestration platforms, composite AI, governance, human-centered AI and generative AI are all in this early phase. More familiar technologies, such as edge AI, decision intelligence and knowledge graphs, are at the peak of inflated expectations phase of the hype cycle, while chatbots, autonomous vehicles and computer vision are all in the trough of disillusionment. SEE: Salesforce rolls out AI-powered workflows, contact center updates in Service Cloud Gartner analysts Shubhangi Vashisth and Svetlana Sicular wrote the report and identified these four AI mega trends: Companies are looking to operationalize AI platforms to enable reusability, scalability and governance and speed up AI adoption and growth. AI orchestration and automation platforms (AIOAPs) and model operationalization (ModelOps) reflect this trend. Innovation in AI means efficient use of all resources, including data, models and compute. Multi-experience AI, composite AI, generative AI and transformers are examples of this trend. Responsible AI includes explainable AI, risk management and AI ethics for increased trust, transparency, fairness and auditability of AI initiatives. Small and wide data approaches enable more robust analytics and AI, reduce organizations' dependency on big data and deliver more complete situational awareness. Vashisth and Sicular also see an increased focus on minimum viable products and accelerated AI development cycles, which they see as an important best practice. These six technologies are all in the ""innovation trigger"" phase of the hype cycle and are expected to hit the plateau of productivity (the end of the hype cycle) within two to five years: Composite AI AI orchestration and automation platform AI governance Generative AI Human-centered AI Synthetic data Here is a brief description of each type of AI, based on Gartner's hype cycle report. Composite AI This approach to AI combines various techniques to expand the level of knowledge representations and solve more business problems more efficiently. The goal is to build AI solutions that need less data and energy to learn. The idea is that this approach will make the tech available to companies that don't have large amounts of data but do have significant human expertise. This technology is emerging, according to Gartner, and has penetrated 5 to 20% of the target market. This technique is best when there is not enough data for traditional analysis or when the ""required type of intelligence is very hard to represent in current artificial neural networks."" AI orchestration and automation platform Companies use AIOAP to standardize DataOps, ModelOps, MLOps and deployment pipelines and put governance practices in place. This technology also unifies development, delivery and operational contexts, particularly around reusing components such as feature and model stores, monitoring, experiment management, model performance and lineage tracking. This trend is being driven by problems created by traditional siloed approaches of data management and analysis. AIOAP is emerging and has reached 1% to 5% of the target audience. SEE: Open source powers AI, yet policymakers haven't seemed to notice To implement AIOAP, Gartner recommends that companies audit current data and analytics practices, simplify data and analytic processes and use cloud service provider environments. AI governance AI governance is the practice of establishing accountability for the risks that come with using AI. Government leaders in Japan, the U.S. and Canada are setting guard rails for AI with some voluntary guidance and some binding. The analysts note that AI without governance is dangerous but putting rules in place can help establish accountability. Governance efforts should not be stand-alone initiatives and should address: Ethics, fairness and safety to protect a business and its reputation Trust and transparency Diversity Governance is emerging and has reached 1% to 5% of the target audience. Companies should set risk guidelines based on business risk appetite and regulations and ensure that humans are in the loop to mitigate AI deficiencies. Generative AI This type of AI applies what it has learned to create new content, such as text, images, video and audio files. Generative AI is most relevant to life sciences, healthcare, manufacturing, material science, media, entertainment, automotive, aerospace, defense and energy industries, according to the report. The analysts predict that generative AI will disrupt software coding and could automate up to 70% of the work done by programmers when combined with automation techniques. This technology also can be used for fraud, malware, disinformation and motivation for social unrest. SEE: 3 ways criminals use artificial intelligence in cybersecurity attacks This technology is emerging and has reached less than 1% of the target audience. The analysts recommend paying close attention to generative AI because they expect rapid adoption. Companies should prepare to deal with deepfakes , determine initial use cases and think about how synthetically generated data could speed up the analytics development cycle and lower the cost of data acquisition. Human-centered AI This approach to AI is also called augmented intelligence or human-in-the-loop and assumes people and technology are working together. This means certain tasks are completed by an algorithm and some by humans. Also, people can take over a process when the AI has reached the limits of its capabilities. HCAI can help companies manage AI risks and be more ethical and efficient with automation. According to the report, ""Many AI vendors have also shifted their positions to the more impactful and responsible HCAI approach."" HCAI is emerging and has reached 5% to 20% of the target audience. Gartner recommends establishing HCAI as a key principle and creating an AI oversight board to review all AI plans. Companies also should use AI to focus human attention where it is most needed to support digital transformation . Synthetic data Artificially generated data is one solution to the challenge of obtaining real-world data and labeling it to train AI models. Synthetic data also solves the problem of removing personally identifiable information from live data. This data is cheaper and faster to get and reduces cost and time in machine learning development. The drawbacks to this data are that it can have bias problems, miss natural anomalies or fail to contribute new information to existing data. This technology is emerging and has reached 1% to 5% of the target audience. Companies should work with specialist vendors while this technology matures and with data scientists to make sure a synthetic data set is statistically valid.

MSF hygienists in Sierra Leone during the Ebola outbreak in December 2014. Photo courtesy Anna Surinyach/MSF Harnessing artificial intelligence to help prevent epidemics before they spread Marie McInerney Raina MacIntyre and Arunn Jegan Friday, September 10, 2021 #WCepi2021 , COVID-19 , digital technology , global health , public health , Public health and population health , vaccination Introduction by Croakey: As with the COVID-19 pandemic, health authorities usually identify epidemics through public health surveillance, but could we do it earlier by being able to mine “the vast un-curated public data available to us in this digital age”? That’s the hope and challenge from leading epidemiologist, Professor Raina MacIntyre, who heads the Biosecurity Program at the Kirby Institute, and Arunn Jegan, Advocacy Coordinator at Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). They write below on the potential for harnessing artificial intelligence and the proliferation of the internet and social media for early detection of epidemics, saying that a signal for unusual pneumonia in China could have been detected in November 2019 and that CSIRO research showed that the Ebola epidemic in West Africa could have been detected three months before the World Health Organization was aware of it. They ask: Imagine if the COVID-19 pandemic had been detected well before it spread around the world, when there was only a handful of cases contained within a small geographic location?” Readers may also be interested in the series of articles published by the Croakey Conference News Service from the recent World Congress of Epidemiology, with one on innovative Victorian disease surveillance measures and their critical role in the state’s COVID response to be published soon. Raina MacIntyre and Arunn Jegan write: The SARS-COV2 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused devastation around the world, and even in vaccinated populations, it continues to mutate into dangerous variants of concern. With the onset of the Delta variant, we assume the death toll will rise beyond five million in 2021. This is an epidemic disease, which means it grows exponentially. One case today will be five cases in a few days and then 25 cases and so on. So, time is of the essence, and the sooner you can identify epidemics, the better the prospect of stamping it out and preventing global spread. Imagine if the COVID-19 pandemic had been detected well before it spread around the world, when there was only a handful of cases contained within a small geographic location? Isolating cases and tracing and quarantining their contacts may have been enough to stop it spreading. Exponential growth and time are the enemies we face with epidemic diseases – the longer we take to act, the larger the epidemic will become and over a very short period. Just look at the Sydney outbreak which started in Bondi in June 2021. Recall the West African Ebola epidemic in 2014. It was 67 times the size of the largest previously recorded Ebola outbreak, it reached urban areas, and killed more than 11,300 people. Ebola outbreaks can kill 25 to 90 percent of those infected. In 2014-15, hundreds of health workers died, decimating the already-struggling healthcare systems of Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone. Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) responded in each of these contexts. In the Ebola outbreak, with fears of a pandemic on the horizon, organisations like the World Health Organization (WHO), MSF, and others supported national health systems by treating and isolating patients; tracing and follow up of patient contacts; raising community awareness of the disease such as how to prevent it and where to seek care; conducting safe burials; proactively detecting new cases; and supporting existing health structures. When WHO was first notified of Ebola in March 2014, it may have comprised a few 100 cases, but it grew exponentially. By August 2014, the case numbers were in the thousands, and by October over 20,000 cases had occurred. Furthermore, until only very recently, there were no tools to prevent or treat Ebola. Today a preventive vaccine and curative drugs are available. Imagine how many lives could have been saved if the epidemic had been detected when there were only a handful of cases. Prior to COVID-19 in 2019, the Ebola epidemic saw the fastest trajectory to development of a vaccine, with Phase 1 trials in Oct 2014 to the approval of this vaccine in Nov 2019. Indeed, the average time was 10-15 years prior to both COVID-19 and Ebola vaccine developments. For COVID-19, vaccines were developed and ready for use in less than 12 months, but after devastating global consequences of the pandemic and the hundreds of thousands killed in the global north. In short, it is unwise to rely solely upon vaccines and or/ their development to manage an epidemic, especially in low-resource settings. Non-pharmaceutical interventions such as testing, tracing and measures to reduce contact between people are also important. We have had a measles vaccine since the 1960s, however the disease rages through the world in epidemic proportions in over 41 countries such the Democratic Republic of Congo and Central African Republic. The primary reason behind this is a deeply inequitable, and unfair global biomedical system which has unfairly provided for wealthier countries but not low-income countries. We are seeing it play out with COVID-19, where only 1.8 per cent of people in low-income countries have received one dose, out of 5.4 billion doses administered globally. What is Australia doing in response? With COVID-19, the general public have had a taste of what epidemiologists have known for decades, that strong health surveillance is essential to getting on top of outbreaks and to have any chance of “zero e",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

imination” strategies, or any suppression strategy for that matter, working. While the global disparity of vaccination rates persists, what new technologies is Australia investing in to helping communities get on-top of outbreaks and bolster health surveillance? How are we harnessing artificial intelligence together with the proliferation of the internet and social media for early detection of epidemics? The usual way we identify epidemics is through public health surveillance – which is when labs or doctors notify health authorities of unusual, serious, or notifiable infections. When lots of these notifications start piling up, or a trend is seen of higher case numbers than usual, the health official may investigate a possible outbreak. But people talk about illness in their communities, and local news agencies report on unusual outbreaks, long before health officials know about it. What if we could mine the vast, un-curated public data available to us in this digital age and detect signals of epidemics early? At UNSW, the EpiWatch observatory does just that, tapping into news reports from around the world, in many different languages, using algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI) to detect early outbreak signals. We showed that a signal for unusual pneumonia in China could have been detected in November 2019; and CSIRO research showed that the Ebola epidemic in West Africa could have been detected three months before WHO was aware of it. This is in no way a replacement for in-country based data collection or existing Early Warning, and Alert Response Systems (EWARS). Using AI in epidemiology is an additional tool that uses  innovative technologies and has the potential to reach communities who do not have the strongest national health surveillance systems. It can also overcome censorship of information to detect signals in countries that are withholding outbreak information from the world. Reasons for censorship include fear of impacts on tourism, trade, or other parts of the economy, or political reasons. Traditionally, declaring epidemics rest solely on the responsibility of governments, but never in human history has there been more attention on virology and epidemiology from the public. Therefore, ensuring that data-collected from the internet follows scientific modelling and surveying has never been more important. As with most emergent technology using data and information to inform a product, the ethics over use of open-source data and safe-guards will need to be in place on who this empowers. Generally, however, methods such as used by Epiwatch do not utilise identifying or private information. Moving forward the Kirby Institute at UNSW, with CSIRO Data 61 is exploring with MSF on how best AI can be utilised to detect epidemics as fast as possible and give vulnerable communities in low-income countries a fighting chance when epidemics strike. Applying our lessons learnt from the COVID-19 pandemic and Ebola, now is the right time for Australia and the humanitarian community to invest in innovative health surveillance systems, and to keep potential epidemics isolated to save lives.

They know all about what’s happening in Public Health, right up to the last minute! Dr Janet Roden New South Wales Nurses and Midwives' Association HUGE congratulations to all the Croakey team on your coverage of our Summit. To say we have been delighted with the event, your coverage and the wash up is an understatement. You did such a fantastic job.  I know how much there was to synthesise! I was particularly impressed with the flair and variety in how you approached the various pieces of coverage. Leanne Wells Chief Executive Officer, Consumer Health Forum of Australia re: #ShiftingGears (2021) Croakey Health Media was the official media partner for VicHealth’s Life and Health Reimagined series (2020). Croakey’s indepth coverage of the five-week series amplified the conversation about how we can make life after coronavirus better and healthier for everyone. Croakey’s coverage included compelling articles about each week’s topic and wrap-ups of the live-streamed events, live tweeting, a Twitter takeover of the @WePublicHealth account and a podcast summarising the series. Having Croakey as our media partner enabled us to reach a more diverse public health audience and introduced new voices and experts to the discussion. Croakey’s team also generated a lively dialogue on social media about the series, driving debate and frank discussion on the important topic of how do we create a healthier, fairer, better world post-pandemic. I would highly recommend Croakey Conference News Service to anyone seeking an innovative and collaborative media partner for a conference or event. Rachel Murphy VicHealth Mental Health Victoria – Croakey Conference News Service coverage of #Lived Experience online forum Mental Health Victoria, in partnership with the Victorian Healthcare Association, ran an online forum on the importance of embedding the voice of lived experience in mental health system reform. Croakey journalist Marie McInerney did an exceptional job of covering the event through both real-time social media posts and a written article summarising the discussion and themes that arose during the forum. Her regular Twitter posts throughout the event generated lively discussion and helped emphasise and elevate the important contributions from the consumer voices. The article that Marie wrote on the event, titled “Imagine a mental health system that meets the needs of consumers and carers” took the reader on a journey through the forum’s key themes along with images and other media to supplement the discussion. It received very positive feedback from all involved. Larissa Taylor Director, Policy, Mental Health Victoria Croakey is an outstanding achievement and an absolutely essential part of the public health scene. It’s required reading for anyone who wants to know what’s happening, why, and what should be happening. Croakey is produced by an exceptional team of editors, authors and other contributors.

Twitter RSS Feeds for Publishers For Reporters My Account Log In September 9, 2021 Kangaroo Court: Developing Competitive Strategies Alongside AI Chip Delany Association of Certified E-Discovery Specialists (ACEDS) + Follow x Following x Following - Unfollow Contact LinkedIn Facebook Twitter Send Embed To embed, copy and paste the code into your website or blog: The recent developments in AI and machine learning across industries have convinced many that this innovation is on par with the great, transformative technologies of the past: electricity, cars, plastics, the microchip, the internet, and the smartphone. From economic history, we know how these general-purpose technologies diffuse and transform. We also realize how hard it is to forecast when, where, and how the most disruptive changes will take place. At the same time, we have learnt what to look for, how to be ahead of the curve, and when a new technology is likely to transition from something interesting to something transformative. When the predictive accuracy of AI solutions is aligned with ease of access and use, firms can leverage predictive coding and unsupervised learning solutions with greater confidence. They can move towards a faster and more comprehensive delivering of litigation prep and advisory by understanding their client’s data through predicting where litigation is likely to occur and whether it is worth settling or moving to trial. This can occur through a comprehensive unsupervised learning approach where enterprise data is classified according to the context of which it appears within the data. Consider at a basic level identifying privilege signals, or the more sophisticated use of emotional signals that provide evidence of fraud. These outcomes are valuable for the corporate client, but they go further to providing a competitive strategy that can increase a law firm practice groups business considerably. The application of unsupervised learning and more targeting predictive coding can reduce uncertainty throughout both the discovery process and performance reporting. It’s great to show your clients a more efficient workflow, but what really matters is the tangible data that demonstrates how changing their behavior to incorporate your AI driven solutions will provide them with better results and lower fees over time. This can be used to both increase confidence in existing clients and demonstrate to new prospects how your firm can provide competitive value. Breaking it all down The essence of formulating competitive strategy is relating a company to its environment. Although the relevant environment is very broad, encompassing social as well as economic forces, the key aspect of the firm’s environment is the industry or industries in which it competes. Forces outside the industry are significant primarily in a relative sense; since outside forces usually affect all firms in the industry, the key is found in the differing abilities of firms to deal with them. The intensity of competition in an industry is neither a matter of coincidence nor bad lack. Rather, competition in an industry is rooted in its underlying economic structure and goes well beyond the behavior of current competitors. The state of competition in an industry depends on five basic forces. The collective strength of these forces determines the ultimate profit potential in the industry, where profit potential is measured in terms of long run return on invested capital. Not all industries have the same potential. They differ fundamentally in their ultimate profit potential as the collective strength of the forces differs; the forces range from intense in industries like tires, paper, and steel – where no firm earns spectacular returns – to relatively mild in industries like oil-field equipment and services, cosmetics, and toiletries – where high returns are quite common. The best strategy for a given firm is ultimately a unique construction reflecting its particular circumstances. However, at the broadest level we can identify three internally consistent generic strategies (which can be used singly or in combination) for creating such a defendable position in the long run and outperforming competitors in a practice or industry. In coping with the five competitive forces, there are three potentially successful generic strategic approaches to outperforming other firms in an industry: Overall cost leadership Differentiation Focus Effectively implementing any of these generic strategies usually requires total commitment and supporting organizational arrangements that are diluted if there is more than one primary target. The generic strategies are approaches to outperforming competitors in the industry; in some industries structure will mean that all firms can earn high returns, whereas in others, success with one of the generic strategic may be necessary just to obtain acceptable returns in an absolute sense. Overcall cost leadership Cost leadership requires aggressive construction of efficient-scale facilities, vigorous pursuit of cost reductions from experience, tight cost and overhead control, avoidance of marginal customer accounts, and cost minimization in areas like R&D, service, sales force, advertising, and so on. Achieving a low overall cost position often requires a high relative market share or other advantages, such as favorable access to raw materials. Differentiation The second generic strategy is one of differentiating the product or service offering of the firm, creating something that is perceived industrywide as being unique. Differentiation, if achieved, is a viable strategy for earning above-average returns in an industry because it creates a defensible position for coping with the five competitive forces, albeit in a different way than cost leadership. Differentiation provides insulation against competitive rivalry because of brand loyalty by customers and resulting lower sensitivity to price. It also increases margins, which avoids the need for low-cost production. The resulting customer loyalty and the need for a competitor to overcome uniqueness provide entry barriers. Focus The final generic strategy is focusing on a particular buyer group, segment of the product line, or geographic market; as with differentiation, focus may take many forms. Although the low cost and differentiation strategies are aimed at achieving their objectives industrywide, the entire focus strategy is build around serving a particular target very well, and each functional policy is developed with this in mind. The strategy rests on the premise that the firm is thus able to serve its narrow strategic target more effectively or efficiently than competitors who are competing more broadly. As a result, the firm achieves either differentiation from better meeting the needs of the particular target, or lower costs in serving this target, or both. Further thoughts Whichever strategy a firm chooses, it is critical that it defines this strategy before it begins implementing AI solutions. The value of AI is clear. It enables firms to save time and resources. It supercharges the analytic ability of attorneys across a variety of practice groups, enabling their teams with both a more comprehensive and focused understanding of the matter at hand. This in turn leads to better service and results for their clients. Competitive strategy involves positioning a business to maximize the value of the capabilities that distinguish it from its competitors. It follows that the central aspect of strategy formulation is perceptive competitor analysis. The objective of a competitor analysis is to develop a profile of the nature and success of the likely strategy changes each competitor might make, each competitor’s probable respond to the range of feasible strategic moves other firms could initiate, and each competitor’s probably reaction to the array of industry changes and broader environmental shifts that might occur. As AI advances, we’ll use machine learning to reduce uncertainty more broadly. Hence, strategic dilemmas driven by uncertainty will evolve with AI. As the cost of AI falls, machine learning will resolve a wider variety of strategic dilemmas. AI will increase the value of the complements to prediction. The data resulting from machine learning will become so important that it will help inform firms when to change their strategy and take advantage of what it has to offer.

For investors looking to invest in booming fields in the tech trade, artificial intelligence (AI) stocks are a viable play. Namely, the stock market today is home to various AI firms that employ the tech in a vast array of industries. This would be the case as the use cases for the tech continues to grow day by day. After all, not only does AI help organizations with computational issues, but the tech is constantly improving via machine learning. As a result, investors would be keeping an eye on emerging names in the field. This is evident given the latest news regarding the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (the Foundation). Namely, the Foundation is now in a four-year deal with U.K.-based AI start-up, Exscientia. Through the potentially $70 million deal, Exscientia aims to develop “novel antiviral pills that could be used to treat COVID-19 and stop future pandemics from spreading”. Accordingly, it would not surprise me to see the top artificial intelligence stocks gaining traction in the stock market now. If anything, major names in the industry continue to make plays as well. As of last week, Alphabet ( NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and C3.Ai ( NYSE: AI ) are currently working together. In detail, the partnership marks an industry-first as the duo look to accelerate enterprise AI. According to C3.Ai, they will provide industry solutions, addressing “real-world challenges” in the financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, and telecommunications industries. By and large, the market for AI and AI-focused companies continues to grow. With that being said, here are three top artificial intelligence stocks for your September 2021 watchlist. Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks To Watch Right Now Amazon.com Inc. ( NASDAQ: AMZN ) CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. ( NASDAQ: CRWD ) IBM Corporation ( NYSE: IBM ) Amazon.com Inc. Amazon is a multinational tech company that focuses on e-commerce and artificial intelligence. Namely, through its Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company offers the broadest and deepest set of machine learning services and supporting cloud infrastructure. With that, it essentially puts machine learning in the hands of every developer, data scientist, and expert practitioner. Amazon has collaborated with companies like T-Mobile ( NASDAQ: TMUS ), which has used AWS to reshape how customers relate to them. AMZN stock currently trades at $3,484.98 as of 3:51 p.m. ET. Today, the company announced an all-new line-up of Fire TV devices with its first-ever Amazon-built smart TVs. The Fire TV Omni Series integrates the Fire TV experience and far-field voice technology directly into the TV, providing an all-in-one entertainment device for streaming, cable TV, music, gaming, and more. Hands-free Alexa voice controls are always available whether the TV is on or off or when using an HDMI input. This would take integration to the next level when coupled with Amazon’s Prime subscription. In late July, the company reported its second-quarter financials. Notably, net income for the quarter increased to $7.8 billion or $15.12 per diluted share. Net sales increased by 27% year-over-year to $113.1 billion in the second quarter and operating income increased to $7.7 billion compared with $5.8 billion a year earlier. Also, the company announced a six-year collaboration with Ford ( NYSE: F ) to bring Alexa to millions of retail and commercial vehicles in North America. The deal is the industry’s broadest roll-out of the Built-in Alexa hands-free experience. All things considered, will you watch AMZN stock?

For the most part, the company is a leading name across the board in the world of tech. Whether it is existing tech or ground-breaking fields such as AI and quantum computing, IBM is innovating in the space. For a sense of scale, the company operates in over 171 countries across the globe. Given the reach and depth of IBM’s tech portfolio, it would make sense that investors are eyeing IBM stock now. As it stands, the company’s shares currently trade at $138.01 as of 3:54 p.m. ET. Now, despite its vast operations, IBM continues to find more room to grow. Firstly, the company is currently working with IntelePeer, a leading Communications Platform-as-a-Service (CPaaS) provider. Through the current partnership, IntelePeer’s Atmosphere CPaaS offering is now available on IBM’s Watson Assistant. In practice, it will help businesses bolster their AI-powered virtual assistants with voice capabilities, without the need for third-party integrations. Daniel Hernandez, General Manager of Data and AI at IBM said, “ IBM is bringing the latest innovations in natural language processing, automation and advancing responsible AI to Watson Assistant so that businesses can transform the customer experience and boost operational efficiency .” On top of that, IBM is also hard at work expanding its cloud-related offerings as well. Earlier this week, the company collaborated with Sumo Logic ( NASDAQ: SUMO ), a pioneering name in continuous intelligence tech. The duo announced the launch of Sumo Logic’s Continuous Intelligence Platform on the Red Hat Marketplace, an open cloud marketplace for enterprise customers.

Credit: Getty Images With use of machine learning, researchers developed a predictive tool that may identify patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) who would not achieve steroid-free clinical remission (SFCR) at week 22 during vedolizumab (VDZ) therapy, according to a study in Scientific Reports . The investigators retrospectively obtained clinical data at baseline (week 0) and assessed the clinical activity of UC at week 22 in 34 patients who began VDZ for the induction of remission at a hospital in Japan between September 2019 and April 2020. Patients underwent blood testing at week 0, and were examined at week 22 (training cohort, cohort 1). In addition, 35 patients with UC who initiated VDZ for the induction of remission at a medical center from January 2019 to June 2020, underwent blood testing at week 0, and were examined at week 22 (cohort 2). Continue Reading Cohort 1 included 25 men and 9 women with a median age of 37 years (range, 17-92 years), and their median disease duration was 5.0 years (range, 0.1-31.0 years). Cohort 2 included 22 men and 13 women with a median age of 42 years (range, 17-90 years), and their median disease duration was 7.2 years (range, 0.6-38.0 years). Data regarding 49 clinical features for cohort 1 were collected and included sex, age, height, body weight, body mass index (BMI), disease duration, disease type (inflammation distribution), treatment history for UC, clinical activity, endoscopic activity, and 25 blood test items. The 8 leading clinical features — partial Mayo score, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, BMI, blood urea nitrogen, concomitant use of azathioprine, lymphocyte fraction, height, and C-reactive protein — at week 0, according to random forest findings, were selected for logistic regression to predict achievement or no achievement of SFCR at week 22. At week 22, 18 patients in cohort 1 (52.9%) and 13 patients in cohort 2 (37.1%) achieved SFCR. No patients in either cohort terminated VDZ treatment due to adverse events. When the top 8 clinical features were assessed using random forest findings, the predictive accuracy was 100% in cohort 1 and 68.6% in cohort 2. The analysis showed that the positive predictive value was 54.5%, and the negative predictive value was 92.3% in cohort 2. The investigators noted that their study was limited by its small sample size and that larger training and test cohorts are needed to improve the prediction model and its accuracy. “The concept and findings in this study will promote personalized medicine in UC, and they could possibly be extrapolated to other medications and diseases,” the researchers commented.

According to The Information , the social media giant is developing a suite of custom chips for its data centers. One of the processors is reportedly designed to power machine learning tasks, including the algorithm that handles Facebook’s content recommendations, while another would assist in transcoding videos to improve the quality of livestreamed videos. In addition to helping reduce its dependence on outside chipmakers, the move to custom silicon could help Facebook lower the carbon footprint of its data centers. The new chips would work alongside the third-party processors the company currently uses in its servers, and reportedly aren’t meant to completely replace what it already has. “Facebook is always exploring ways to drive greater levels of compute performance and power efficiency with our silicon partners and through our own internal efforts,” a spokesperson for the company told Engadget when we reached out to the company about the report. “We have nothing new to share on our future plans at this time."" It wouldn’t be a stretch for Facebook to dip its toes in custom silicon. The company has already dabbled in semi-custom chips. In 2019, for instance, it announced it was working on an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for video transcoding and inference work. It also wouldn't be the first company to look at designing its own chips to improve efficiency and save on costs. Google has had its Tensor chips since 2016, and, as of last year, Microsoft was reportedly exploring custom chips for its own servers as well. TRENDING 1. R.

Analytics teams now have access to a massive amount of elastic computing power and numerous sources of internal and external data. The change has also delivered access to managed cloud services that reduce the complexity of building, training, and deploying machine-learning and deep-learning models at scale. However, this doesn’t mean that there are no challenges yet to be overcome. Data scientists, data engineers, and developers still have to learn and adapt to this new environment, and there is an ever-expanding and rapidly evolving ecosystem of tools and frameworks from which to choose. Many are simply learning as they go. The very capabilities that make the cloud so exciting also create potential pitfalls. The ease of copying data across diverse systems can create governance challenges if not handled correctly, and the speed of change means data teams can bet on the wrong tool or framework and become stranded. To reduce the chance of problems and ensure an organisation can achieve the results it expects, there are six key factors that should be considered. They are: 1. Make data governance a top priority: It’s very important to enable iteration and investigation without compromising governance and security. For example, many data scientists intuitively want to copy a dataset before they start working on it. But it’s too easy to make copies, move on and forget they exist, creating a nightmare in terms of compliance, security, and privacy. 2. Forget your preconceptions: If you’re coming from an on-premises world, you’ll often bring perceptions and biases about infrastructure that no longer apply to modern platforms in the cloud. Approach the cloud from first principles and start with what you want to achieve, not what you think is possible. That’s the only way to push the boundaries and take full advantage of this new environment. 3. Be careful not to create new data silos: A key element that is closely tied to data governance is the concept of data silos. In the cloud, it’s important not to replicate the fragmentation that’s common in the on-premises world. The proliferation of tools, platforms and vendors is great for innovation, but it can also lead to redundant, inconsistent data being stored in multiple locations. 4. Maintain an open mind: One of the exciting things in data science is that frameworks and tools are evolving at an incredible pace. However, it’s critical not to get locked into an approach that limits future options when technologies fall in and out of favour. Choose a data platform that won’t tie you into one framework or one way of doing things, with an extensible architecture that can accommodate new tools and technologies as they come along. 5. Incorporate additional data sources: Cloud platforms make it significantly easier to incorporate external data from partners and data-service providers into existing models. This has been particularly important during the past year, as businesses sought to understand how the impact of COVID-19, fluctuations in the economy, and subsequent changes in consumer behaviour would affect their businesses. Some organisations used data about local infection rates, foot traffic in stores, and signals from social media to predict buying patterns and forecast inventory needs. Consider what data you could be using. 6. Reduce your complexity: AI technologies like machine learning and deep learning are immensely powerful and have a critical role to play for certain business needs, but they’re not right for every problem. Always start with the simplest option and increase complexity as needed. Try a simple linear regression or look at averages and medians. Check the accuracy of predictions and whether the ROI of increasing the accuracy justifies a more complex approach. Analytics tools are quickly becoming more powerful and able to deliver ever-greater benefits to the organisations putting them to work. By adding cloud resources to the picture, data science teams will be able to take their work even further in the future. Data science plus the cloud is a very powerful mix.

Proskauer has been closely monitoring the quickly-developing legal treatment of AI systems, especially in view of their implications for life sciences patents.  AI’s presence in life sciences innovation is well established, for example, to predict biological targets of prospective drug molecules and to identify drug design candidates (among many other applications). As we reported in August , two countries—Australia and South Africa—have already permitted AI systems to qualify as “inventors” in patent applications.  However, hope for a worldwide trend have been dashed, at least for now. Patent applicant Stephen Thaler and his AI system called DABUS (“Device for Autonomous Bootstrapping of Unified Sentience”) is at the center of these developments.  Naming DABUS as an inventor of his applications, Thaler obtained a South African patent without debate, and successfully argued to an Australian court that the Australia Patents Act should have a flexible interpretation of “inventorship” to include AI, because such interpretation would promote innovation and further pharmaceutical research.  The USPTO, however, rejected Thaler’s application, concluding that an inventor must be a natural person under the Patent Act.  Thaler then asked the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia to vacate the USPTO’s decision and reinstate his patent application. The Court, on motions for summary judgment, affirmed the USPTO’s determination that an inventor must be a natural person.  Focusing on the “plain language” of the 2011 America Invents Act, which provided “an explicit statutory definition for the term ‘inventor,’” the Court’s decision came down to the meaning of a single word: “individual.” The Court found that meaning in a Supreme Court decision construing the term “individual” in the Torture Victim Protection Act (“TVPA”) to mean “natural person[].”  Although concerning different subject matter than the Patent Act, the District Court applied the Supreme Court’s definition of “individual” because, like the TVPA, the Patent Act used the term “individual” in its “ordinary usage,” which was “to refer to a human being.”  Indeed, 35 U.S.C. § 115(b) references the “individual” as “himself or herself,” which the Court found evidenced Congress’s clear intent to “referenc[e] a natural person.”  Further supporting this interpretation, according to the Court, were the Federal Circuit’s “consistent holdings” (albeit in a different context) that “inventors must be natural persons.” Thaler, however, encouraged the Court to interpret inventorship in a manner “consistent with the Founders’ intent in enacting the Patent and Copyright Clause,” which, according to Thaler, was “to promote disclosure of information and commercialization of new technologies.”  Taking too literal a reading of “inventor,” argued Thaler, would frustrate this intent, particularly where “it is unlikely that Congress anticipated and legislated for the specific circumstances at issue.”  Thaler warned, “excluding an entire class of inventions from patentability would undermine the patent system,” as AI-generated inventions may “one day become the primary source of innovation.”  The Court was not swayed by these arguments, which the Court characterized as based in policy, rather than law.  According to the Court, Thaler’s positions could not “override the plain meaning of a statutory term,” and in any event, “[m]atters of policy are for Congress, not the courts, to decide.”  Had Congress intended AI systems to be considered “inventors,” the Court found, Congress could have explicitly included AI systems in the definition, added in 2011, “when artificial intelligence was already in existence.” The decision, unfortunately, leaves unresolved how to obtain patent protection on innovations generated by AI systems.  However, the USPTO’s summary judgment brief hinted at a potential solution—“the use of a machine as a tool by natural person(s) does not generally preclude natural person(s) from qualifying as an inventor or joint inventors if the natural person(s) contributed to the conception of the claimed invention.”  That assertion, of course, begs the question of what happens when no natural person contributes to the invention. Thaler has indicated that he intends to appeal the District Court’s decision to the Federal Circuit.  We will continue to monitor and report developments on this novel legal issue.  The case is Thaler v. Hirshfeld , No. 1:20-cv-00903, pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, a copy of which can be found here . © 2021 Proskauer Rose LLP.

of AI in Cybersecurity News provided by Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP Sep 09, 2021, 16:43 ET Share this article Share this article WASHINGTON , Sept. 9, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Pillsbury has published a new research report that seeks to illuminate the important role artificial intelligence stands to play in defending against cyberattacks and data leaks. Titled ""Artificial Intelligence & Cybersecurity: Balancing Innovation, Execution and Risk"" and written by The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), the 22-page report uses extensive research and expert interviews to examine how AI can help strengthen cybersecurity, how the growing need for data to train AI systems is intensifying concerns around privacy, and how companies can anticipate risk. ""As the public and private sectors have embraced digital transformation, their vulnerability to cyber threats has expanded considerably,"" said Pillsbury's firmwide Technology Industry Group leader Justin Hovey . ""However, AI tools are well-suited to address some of the largest gaps in existing cyber defenses. Our hope is that this research can help organizations better understand the technology and therefore better protect themselves and the individuals they serve."" The research features extensive interviews with leading experts including AJ Abdallat (CEO, Beyond Limits), Johan Gerber (EVP Security & Cyber Innovation, MasterCard), Ansgar Koene (Global AI Ethics & Regulatory Leader, EY), Jessica Newman (Program Lead, AI Security Initiative, UC Berkeley), Marietje Schaake (President, CyberPeace Institute and International Policy Director, Cyber Policy Center, Stanford University ), Leo Simonovich (VP & Global Head of Industrial Cyber and Digital Security, Siemens Energy) and Monique Shivanandan (CISO, HSBC). It also contains perspectives from Pillsbury lawyers, including David Stanton's views on the value of cyber risk ratings and Rafi Azim-Khan's take on the potential impact of the European Union's AI Act. Some of the data collected and examined in the report: On average, it takes approximately nine months to identify and contain a data breach (207 days to detect the issue and another 73 to rectify it). The worldwide average cost for a data breach in 2020 was US$3.86 million . Business email compromise events increased by more than 50% in 2020, while ransomware attacks were up by 160%, and third-party and supply chain intrusions almost tripled. Data security is the No. 1 reason many professionals are deploying AI, and nearly half of executives in Asia-Pacific , Europe , and the U.S. (48.9%) think AI/machine learning is the best tool to counter nation-state cyberattacks. The market value of AI in cybersecurity is predicted to reach US$46.3 billion by 2027. To read the full report, click here . Pillsbury lawyers advise public and privately held businesses on all manner of cybersecurity, data protection and privacy law issues, with particular experience in the technology, energy, financial, communications, defense/government contracts and health care sectors, as well as with critical infrastructure generally. Our multinational team of regulatory authorities, litigators, transactional lawyers, intellectual property counsel, government contracts practitioners and legislative strategists work closely with clients worldwide to monitor the rapidly changing data and cyber landscapes and tackle related security challenges. The firm's multidisciplinary AI team likewise advises companies and government agencies on the technical complexities of artificial intelligence, as well as the evolving regulatory and legal standards that apply to it. Whether in relation to machine learning, natural language processing or neural network projects, we work hand-in-hand with AI innovators, early adopters and investors to address the full range of commercial, regulatory and liability concerns they encounter.

In our times, however, Artificial Intelligence means something else. If computers and cell phones were the technological legacy of the latter 20th century, Artificial Intelligence might be the technological legacy of the 21st century. Most of us run across Artificial Intelligence regularly. When you call to make an appointment or inquire about ordering supplies on the phone, you might be talking to a computer with voice recognition technology. Sometimes when you answer your phone and hear the friendly voice of the telemarketer who responds to your responses, it may take you a while to realize you are talking to a computer, not a real human being. Have you ever searched for a product on the internet or at Amazon, only to see the product advertised on your Facebook page? How did they know? Artificial Intelligence. Computers follow recipes called algorithms that direct the computer to note what you have searched for and then to match that search with advertisers — and put the appropriate ad on your Facebook page. Computer algorithms are just an example of Artificial Intelligence at work. According to academicinfluence.com , Artificial Intelligence — abbreviated AI — “refers to computing which aims to mimic human cognitive functions like learning, problem solving, and adaptation to environmental conditions. ... Artificial Intelligence is actually an umbrella term for various areas of computing including robotics, machine learning, and Artificial neural networking (mimicking the human mind in some way) …” But AI programs can make blunders; Artificial Intelligence is not always so intelligent. Take this recent account from the BBC: “Facebook users who watched a newspaper video featuring black men were asked if they wanted to ‘keep seeing videos about primates’ by an Artificial-Intelligence recommendation system. “Facebook told BBC News it ‘was clearly an unacceptable error’, disabled the system and launched an investigation. “’We apologize to anyone who may have seen these offensive recommendations.’” Some futurists talk about singularity, a time when computers will be self-sustaining, self-improving and no longer need human help. Wikipedia defines singularity further: “... a hypothetical point in time at which technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, resulting in unforeseeable changes to human civilization ... (with( ‘runaway reaction’ of self-improvement cycles… rapidly causing an ‘explosion’ in Intelligence … (that) far surpasses all human intelligence.” Many people are afraid that computers and robots will eventually take over the world, and humans will become servants to these more intelligent pieces of technology. Not everyone is on board with such a doomsday picture. Gotquestions.org makes some good points about AI: “If a person defines Intelligence in a way that eliminates concepts such as morality, emotion, empathy, humor, relationship, and so forth, then the phrase Artificial Intelligence is not so meaningful. This is a particularly important point to keep in mind when discussing strategy games ... in which computers often defeat even the greatest human masters ... the program that bests a human in a strategy game is designed specifically for playing that game. It might win, but the human can then leave the room and do ... things that the machine cannot do. The software that allows the machine to succeed in a trivia game can’t tell you how to tie your shoes. Or make a sandwich. Or draw a flower. Or write a limerick. Nor can it comfort a sick child, pretend to be a character in a play, or watch a movie and later explain the plot to someone else. The truth is that those purpose-built AI computers are markedly less intelligent than the humans whom they defeated in narrow contests.” So where will this go? Let me illustrate. Many children today cannot print neatly; others cannot solve basic math problems apart from a calculator. Fortunately, many can do both of the above. This divide will continue to deep as AI continues to mushroom. Some of us will make the effort to develop and nurture all aspects of our humanity, while others will allow our own humanity to atrophy and take the path of resistance, always relying on AI. The robots will not take over, but some of us will surrender portions of our humanity to them. Ed Vasicek is pastor of Highland Park Church in Kokomo. Contact him at edvasicek@gmail.com .

Her Roomba robot vacuum was set to run in the middle of the night, while she, her husband, and their dogs were asleep. But one of the three dogs — a foster pooch named MacGregor — pooped in the house at around the same time. When Darby got up in the morning, there was poop smeared throughout most of her home. ""I remember walking into my office and it looked like a murder scene, but with poop,"" Darby said Thursday. In her office, she said, the Roomba ran over a power cord, then kept roving in circles, leaving tracks reminiscent of crop circles. They threw out a rug, power cords, and — after her husband tried and failed to clean it — the Roomba. Darby, who works in public relations, said she and her husband bought another Roomba and began using it during the day, but the same sort of thing eventually happened again after MacGregor had another accident indoors. (Despite the Roomba poop-spreading, Darby and her husband adopted MacGregor.) IRobot, the company that makes the Roomba, is trying to eliminate this kind of incident with the use of artificial intelligence. On Thursday iRobot ( IRBT ) announced a new Roomba robot vacuum cleaner called the j7+ that uses AI to spot and stay away from pet poop and power cords. Read More The Roomba j7+ uses artificial intelligence to avoid pet poop and cords from electronics. The vacuum, which is initially available through iRobot's website, costs $850 (or $650 if bought without a base that the vacuum can automatically empty dirt into). IRobot cofounder and CEO Colin Angle told CNN Business that while a power cord is the most common obstacle for a Roomba to get caught on, pet poop is ""the most spectacularly bad"" obstacle. (Angle, who has a dog, said this hasn't happened at his home.) The company has considered for more than five years different technologies — ranging from capacitive sensors, which can measure things like pressure, to olfactory sensors, which detect odor — for detecting waste, he said. Over time, it became more realistic to stuff the necessary computing power into the Roomba itself so that it could use machine vision to recognize pet waste. But in order to make this possible, the company first had to create a diverse dataset of poop (and no, it's not the only company that has spent time working on poop recognition ). Angle said iRobot spent years building a library of pictures of poop, real and faux. The company began, he said, by buying ""all the realistic gag poop you can buy on the internet,"" then branched out into making hundreds of Play-doh poop models, which it painted brown and photographed in different lighting and from different angles. He thinks every iRobot employee with a pet has had that animal's waste photographed from multiple angles. How your poop can help train AI The vacuum has a camera to spot obstacles, and image-recognition algorithms trained on iRobot's dataset can determine whether that obstacle appears to be poop. An accompanying smartphone app can then alert the vacuum's owner, along with a picture of the mess (or power cord). Any time an obstacle is detected, Angle said, a user can decide, via the app, if they want to contribute the image to iRobot's training data. He said the company is confident enough in the vacuum's ability to avoid pet waste that it will replace any j7+ vacuums that get in deep, er, doo-doo. ""We felt like that was an important part of conveying our conviction that we have this one under control,"" Angle said. Darby is thinking of buying the j7+. She said her family, which has since gone through several more Roombas, could use a new one.

Over the summer, the undergraduates applied their data science skills to projects that focus on the need to address quality of life issues for New York City residents in underserved communities. Graduate students from the Columbia Department of Statistics served as mentors during the program. The students presented their report via Zoom at a public BCEQ meeting on September 8. The report findings include: The dropout rate among public school students who live near highways in the Bronx is substantially higher than among those who don’t. Bronx residents who live farther from parks suffer from more health problems than those who live near green spaces. Additionally, positive effects of living near a park are less significant if the park is dirty or in disrepair, as those parks go unused. The completed report is a call to action for Bronx residents about the effects of bad environmental policy. “The series of maps produced by this research raise troubling policy implications for the maintenance and operations of parks, schools, and highway corridors,” said Dr. Robert Fanuzzi, president of BCEQ, an all-volunteer organization that is celebrating 50 years of environmental advocacy. “Columbia is working to improve the public good by expanding and diversifying the Public Interest Technology data science workforce,” said Columbia Professor Tian Zheng, principal investigator for the Columbia-Lehman Public Interest Technology Data Science Corps (PIT-DSC). “Our partnership with Lehman and BCEQ advances our mission to create data science solutions that have a societal impact.” Earlier this year, BCEQ submitted a proposal to the Columbia-Lehman PIT-DSC, which was facilitated by the Town + Gown program, a New York City-wide partnership between universities and local communities that bring academics and practitioners together to create plans for workable solutions to public issues. The proposal was selected for PIT-DSC’s inaugural summer undergraduate research program. The research was also supported by a grant from New America’s Public Interest Technology University Network . As part of the project, BCEQ board members met weekly with the research team of students from various disciplines, including sociology, math, statistics, and computer science. Led by Zi Fang , a graduate student in statistics at Columbia, the students used datasets that incorporated Census data, New Yorkers for Parks reports, and city and state agency databases to come up with their findings. “We are excited with the work of the students. We asked them to help us find out why the Bronx is still 62 out of 62 in the state for negative health outcomes,” said BCEQ Board member Karen Argenti. “The program helped BCEQ find a road to environmental justice in the Bronx.  The numbers and their correlations tell a story of less funding, staffing, maintenance, and planning for open spaces, education workforce, and development in the borough. In other words, systemic racism. I think the students learned a lot, as well.” The project was a success for everyone involved. “We are thrilled to be partnering with BCEQ and Columbia on a project that uses our students’ expertise to understand environmental conditions in the Bronx,” said Lehman Assistant Professor Jennifer Laird, co-principal investigator for PIT-DSC. “This project provides invaluable data science training for our students, most of whom are from the Bronx, and it provides stakeholders with the evidence they need to make informed policy decisions.” Tags Public Health Local News September 13, 2021 In the Libraries: September at George Bruce September 13, 2021 Construction Update: Weeks of 9/13/21 and 9/20/21 September 10, 2021 Commemorate the 20th Anniversary of September 11 in Upper Manhattan September 09, 2021 Columbia University and Pfizer to Establish Clinical Trials Diversity Initiative September 09, 2021 Learn How Students Used Data Science to Explore Health, Wealth, and Education in the Bronx The Office of Government & Community Affairs 309 Low Library, 535 West 116th Street  ·  New York,  NY 10027 Phone (212) 854-5915 Internal Use Only Login to Access Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Columbia University ©2021 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Image credit: University of Adelaide. Latest News New storage battery touted a renewable game-changer Australian Manufacturing Week 2022 to be held in Sydney in June Modelling tool developed to predict polymer properties ANSTO to further bolster neutron science and technology in MoU Microsoft has signed a MoU with the University of Adelaide’s Australian Institute for Machine Learning (AIML) to explore how advanced cloud computing, AI, computer vision and machine learning can be used in space. “Project AI Off Earth” will model, emulate and simulate complex space operations and systems, and build algorithms for on-board satellite data processing. It will develop solutions to remotely operate and optimise satellites, constellations and swarms, and address space domain awareness and debris monitoring. AIML will bring experience in applying AI, computer vision and machine learning to real world problems. Microsoft’s experience in advanced cloud computing and cognitive systems is informing Azure Space. Azure Space is being built as a set of cloud offerings that allow organisations to leverage geospatial data, access bandwidth anywhere, digitally engineer space systems and engage in remote edge computing. This can all be applied in space. “The relationship with Microsoft will give us access to cloud-based platforms that will allow us to focus on the investigation on the performance of algorithms, used to analyse large amounts of earth-observation data from satellites without needing to be concerned about gaining access to space at the onset,” University of Adelaide professor Tat-Jun Chin said. “Our work on these algorithms has the potential to contribute to many applications, including agricultural land management, water management, mining practices and understanding of economic activity.” Microsoft Australia Azure Space engineer Nicholas Moretti, is now based at Adelaide’s innovation precinct, Lot Fourteen. “I first got exposed to the space industry while I was studying for my undergraduate degree at the University of Adelaide and crossed paths with Professor Chin,” Moretti said. “Although focused on in-space technologies, Project AI Off Earth will explore how space related technologies and data, and cognitive systems can be used to support automation of multiple different industries, help establish smart cities, as well as address sustainability and important environment challenges.” Microsoft and AIML are already collaborating using Microsoft Azure Orbital Emulator, a cloud-based native space emulation environment that enables massive satellite constellation simulations. Using this, AIML and Project AI Off Earth can develop, evaluate and train algorithms, machine learning models and AI intended for space without the need to launch a satellite. “Adelaide has established itself as the very heart of Australia’s space industry,” SA minister for Trade and Investment Stephen Patterson said. “This agreement between AIML and Microsoft, which is building a space team, is a signal of what’s to come. Australia has the opportunity to be a leading player in the global space industry and this sort of international collaboration – centred on Adelaide but with a truly global focus – will strengthen the local industry, help build skills in this important area and reinforce Adelaide’s reputation as the epicentre of space activity in this part of the world.” Moretti and Chin discuss the new partnership between Microsoft and the University of Adelaide’s AIML in the video below.

More content below AMZN Shot Efficiency and Passing Profile bring the total number of advanced statistics to eight, using AWS machine learning and analytics to give fans deeper insights into the game of football SEATTLE, September 09, 2021 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Today, Amazon Web Services (AWS), an Amazon.com , Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), and the German Bundesliga, Germany’s top national football league, announced two new Bundesliga Match Facts powered by AWS that will premier as graphics during broadcasts and in the official Bundesliga app during the 2021 – 22 season. The first advanced stat, Shot Efficiency, compares the actual number of goals that a player or team has scored with how many goals the player or team should have scored based on the quality of their chances. The second, Passing Profile, provides deeper insights into the pass quality of a player or an entire team. Both stats will debut during Matchday 4 on September 11, 2021, featuring the faceoff between German Champion FC Bayern München and the second-place team of the previous season, RB Leipzig. For more information, videos, and blogs about each stat, visit aws.amazon.com/sports/bundesliga . This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210909005938/en/ Passing Profile, one of the new Bundesliga Match Facts powered by AWS for the 21-22 season. (Graphic: Business Wire) Bundesliga Match Facts help audiences better understand nuanced aspects of the game of football, such as decision making on the pitch or what goes into exceptional player performance. Bundesliga generates the Match Facts by gathering and analyzing the match feeds from live games in real time as they’re streamed into AWS. On the backend, Bundesliga uses AWS capabilities in analytics, machine learning, compute, storage, database, serverless, and media services to process and store the vast amount of data that powers these statistics, as well as to train, deploy, and scale the machine learning models used to generate predictions. Fans see the insights as graphics during broadcasts, with additional details in the official Bundesliga app. The two new Match Facts will better showcase the action on the field and give fans, coaches, players, and commentators visual support for analyzing players’ and teams’ performance. Story continues New Bundesliga Match Facts for the 2021–22 season powered by AWS Shot Efficiency: Football fans love to revisit and break down scoring opportunities to better celebrate or mourn key game moments. This new stat helps fans determine which players or teams best exploit their chances at scoring a goal. It compares the number of goals that a player or team has actually scored with the cumulative value from Expected Goals (xGoals)—an existing Bundesliga Match Fact—which is the number of goals the player or team should have scored based on the quality of their attempted shots. The difference between these two values is the Shot Efficiency number. If the value is negative (shown on TV by a red arrow pointing down), the player or team has scored fewer goals than would have been expected. If the value is positive (green arrow up), the player or team exceeded the expected value. For the first time, each player’s efficiency can be objectively assessed based on the overall quality of shots and the number of goals scored. For example, this advanced stat can compare two strikers who scored the same number of goals after 10 matchdays to determine which player is converting goals in challenging versus easy situations. Commentators can also use the stat, for instance, to analyze if players have a high number of goals because they are well supported by their teammates or because they exploit openings in the defense. Passing Profile: Fans often put themselves into a player’s shoes and compare the choices they might have made in a given situation to what the player actually did. This new stat helps fans understand how players think and decide where to pass the ball. It also provides deeper insights into the pass quality and pass strength of players and teams, including which passing decisions they prioritize, such as an offensive pass, passing the ball back, or opening up play with a long ball. Before Passing Profile, the effectiveness of player passing was measured primarily by the number of passes that successfully reach a player’s target; now, with Passing Profile, it is possible to assess the quality of passes too, accounting for pass difficulty. For instance, by looking at how many opponents press the recipient and passer, how high the ball is in the air, and how many opponents were positioned between the recipient and passer, the stat calculates the pass difficulty rating. It also offers further insights into the passing behavior of a player or team by identifying the number of long and short passes, pass direction, and the type of passes a player favors. To develop these stats, machine learning models trained on Amazon SageMaker (AWS’s service that enables data scientists and developers to build, train, and deploy machine learning models quickly) analyzed thousands of video hours of previous Bundesliga seasons. In the case of Shot Efficiency, Bundesliga trained its machine learning models on a dataset of more than 40,000 historical shots on goal, which includes features derived from player positional data, such as distance to goal, angle to goal, player speed, number of defenders in the line of a shot, and goalkeeper coverage. In the case of Passing Profile, Bundesliga analyzed video of nearly 2 million passes and used that data to construct an algorithm that computes a difficulty score for each pass at any moment, evaluating characteristics such as distance to the receiver, the number of defending players in between, and pressure on a player. Once computed, Bundesliga aggregates difficulty scores for each player and team to form a passing profile. ""Bundesliga Match Facts powered by AWS allow us to give fans more insight into the game of football, broadcasters more interesting stories to tell, and coaches and teams more data to excel at their game. Last year, the reception for Bundesliga Match Facts around the world was very positive, and we will continue to raise the bar and innovate on these analytics using machine learning to make them even better. The two new stats for this season give fans a view into player efficiency that hasn’t been achieved before, and we are still just at the beginning of our relationship with AWS. I’m excited to see how technology will continue to evolve the fan experience and the game,"" said Andreas Heyden, Executive Vice President of Digital Innovations for DFL Deutsche Fußball Liga (DFL) Group. ""Teams, leagues, broadcasters, and their partners from across the sports world are using AWS to build data-driven solutions and elevate the fan experience. We’re excited to continue our work with Bundesliga to connect with their fans in a way they haven’t been able to before this collaboration,"" said Klaus Buerg, General Manager for AWS Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, Amazon Web Services EMEA SARL. ""Through the work we’ve accomplished with Bundesliga in creating eight Bundesliga Match Facts in a short period of time, we are giving fans a new way to appreciate player speed, field positioning, goals, passing, and shot efficiency, creating even more excitement in watching the game."" These two new Match Facts join Speed Alert , Goal Probability, xGoals , Most Pressed Player , Attacking Zones , and Average Positions: Trends to bring the total number of insights available for Bundesliga fans to eight. Information on all of these statistics can be found at aws.amazon.com/sports/bundesliga/ . Football fans also can follow all of the latest Bundesliga action on Bundesliga.com and via the official Facebook , Twitter , and Instagram channels.

The MCA award is the only cross-disciplined, career-oriented award that aims to protect the time and resources of mid-career scholars, enabling applicants the opportunity to concentrate on research and training while building synergistic and mutually beneficial partnerships. Wenwen Li, professor in the ASU School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning. Download Full Image “I am super excited and humbled to receive this Mid-Career Advancement award from NSF. In preparation of the proposal, I have received tremendous support from many of my ASU colleagues, and I cannot thank them enough,” said Li, who specializes in spatial analysis and using cyberinfrastructure and artificial intelligence to explore new questions about the geographic world. “I am viewing this award not only as an opportunity to advance my own career, but also a good timing to return my service back to the community to help junior and other mid-career scholars to boost their careers, increase visibility, develop leadership to achieve amazing success and happiness.” The award will support Li’s research that explores new ways of integrating artificial intelligence, geospatial analysis and cyberinfrastructure into Arctic permafrost research. In partnership with Anna Liljedahl, an Arctic permafrost hydrology expert from Woodwell Climate Research Center, Li aims to develop novel GeoAI (geospatial artificial intelligence) solutions to enable automated, high-resolution mapping and the quantification of permafrost thaw at a pan-Arctic scale. “Polar regions play a vital role in Earth’s climate, ecosystems and economy. Unfortunately, climate change is driving dramatic changes in the Arctic ecosystem, endangering its natural environment, infrastructure and lives,” Li said. “Arctic permafrost, ground that remains below 0 degrees Celsius for at least two consecutive summers, is at the center of this change.” By developing new GeoAI solutions, Li and Liljedahl hope to create a high-resolution dataset that quantifies permafrost thaw and helps scientists gain a better understanding and accurate prediction of the landscape changes in the Arctic. Additionally, the research pair will co-create an initiative called “Women in Polar Cyberinfrastructure” to diversify the field of cyberinfrastructure, AI and Arctic science by offering training to more female scholars and underrepresented minorities. “I have always had a great interest in applying data science methods to solve environmental problems, especially those endangering the polar regions,” Li said. “This award focuses exactly on career advancement in polar data science; it offers an exciting opportunity for me to build a large collaboration network with Arctic scientists to broaden and deepen the applications of various computational solutions that my team has developed for better problem solving in the Arctic.” University News Tempe campus School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Spatial Analysis Research Center Grants / Awards Research Environment Faculty David Rozul Communications Specialist, School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning 480-727-8627 david.rozul@asu.edu Next Story How engineering grads get their dream jobs For someone who grew up playing Xbox, working for Microsoft Devices — the team behind that gaming console and many other devices people use every day — is the definition of a dream job.

Working engineers and technologists as well as recruiters host information sessions and informal coffee chats to help get conversations going between professionals, alumni and students. They also conduct resume reviews, get involved in the classroom, attend student organization meetings and judge competitions. Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering electrical engineering alumna Mary Byron worked at Microsoft marketing events as a Microsoft Ambassador while she was an undergraduate student. Photo courtesy of Mary Byron Mary Byron , a Fulton Schools electrical engineering alumna who graduated in December 2018, is a product engineer for Xbox at Microsoft Devices and has also worked for Microsoft’s radio frequency development team. As a student, Byron attended coffee chats, a session with Microsoft Devices at a meeting of the ASU section of the Society of Women Engineers and other career events where she asked many questions so recruiters would remember her. “I believe persistence and familiarizing myself with the ones doing the recruiting helped me through the pipeline,” Byron said. The key for students to get involved in the university-industry employer relationship is Handshake , a platform that brings together students, alumni and employers. Employers often go straight to Handshake to post information sessions, interviews, internships, job opportunities and more. There, they can connect with students directly. So Hammond recommends students regularly check Handshake to seek out opportunities to learn about employers and go talk to them. Gaining experiences through getting involved While showing up to industry-hosted events is important, there’s a lot of legwork students need to do on their own to make themselves stand out to employers, Hammond said. “It’s critical to think outside of the standard curriculum and about the ways in which you can grow your skills and your technical knowledge,” she said. Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering electrical engineering alumnus Richard Rigby poses by a Microsoft sign at the company's headquarters in Redmond, Washington. Photo courtesy of Richard Rigby Richard Rigby graduated in December 2020 with an electrical engineering bachelor’s degree. He’s now an electrical engineer at Microsoft Devices working on the Surface Book and Laptop team where he designs schematics, facilitates layout design and debugs circuit boards in current and future Surface devices. Rigby took advantage of Fulton Difference opportunities as a student, but in hindsight, he believes he could have stood out more if he had been more involved in an engineering club. “Engineering clubs where you work with a team on a big project through multiple semesters is probably some of the best experience you can get as a student,” Rigby said. “Not only do you get relevant technical skills, but you also get new, exciting projects that you can put on your resume and brag about in your interviews.” Becoming adept in a particular field can be accomplished in many ways: doing independent or group projects outside of school requirements, reading books on the topic, joining working groups on Facebook or LinkedIn. Sometimes students may need to figure out their “why” — the reason students really want the type of job they want — so students should get curious and explore. The key to success here, Hammond says, is to do it because you love your field of study and you have a passion that will make an impression on employers. That’s where the Fulton Difference comes in. This guiding principle of the Fulton Schools partly focuses on fostering success beyond the classroom through extracurricular activities to enhance students’ experiences and skill-building. Researching careers and companies Students should also spend time learning about companies before meeting with their representatives. This helps students see how their passion aligns with the company’s vision. One of the most important things a student can do, Hammond says, is conduct research about a company. Much of this is individual work, looking into products and services, how the company functions and even investment reports. Together, this information can provide the same sort of knowledge a first-day employee would have. “Understanding the company from a first-day employee mindset helps you walk into an interview with more information about the organization, more confidence and the ability to ask questions about the company’s vision statement and goals and their plan to get to the next level,” Hammond said. “You’re connecting with them as a potential future teammate, and that shows a maturity, an awareness and how you are making the same type of investment in this process that they’re putting in you.” Altogether, cultivating a passion for engineering, gaining experiences and knowing a company at the level of a new employee will set students apart. “If you have that passion and share it with a first-day employee mindset, those things come together and will propel you to the next level,” Hammond said. Samuel Perez Diarte is fascinated by the inner workings of electronics. The May 2018 electrical engineering graduate explored this field as an undergraduate student through a variety of activities outside the classroom. He found an internship opportunity with Microsoft Devices that aligned with his goals, which contributed to him landing his current job. “I realized that this was what I wanted to do when I got to travel to China and take devices apart for investigations,” said Perez Diarte, who also earned a minor in business. “I’ve always loved taking things apart for fun just to try to figure out how things work, but now I was getting paid for it.” Samuel Perez Diarte, an Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering electrical engineering alumnus, attends a Microsoft Devices celebration event in September 2019. Photo courtesy of Samuel Perez Diarte Putting it all together with the Fulton Schools Career Center From first-year students to alumni, the Fulton Schools Career Center has resources to help navigate the entire career planning process. The Fulton Schools Career Center helped Rigby prepare through resume reviews with the peer career coaches — other Fulton Schools students who are trained to help with career readiness. Rigby was a peer career coach too, so he knew the value of such a resource. “I cannot express how dramatic a transformation my resume went through getting so many trained eyes on it,” Rigby said. “They had a sample resume that was created from feedback from top industry professionals, which was extremely helpful for formatting references and seeing what content my resume was missing.” The peer career coaches also helped him make effective LinkedIn and Handshake profiles for networking and reiterated the importance of attending company recruiting events, which got him in the door at Microsoft Devices. He encourages current Fulton Schools students to make time for an appointment at the career center. “The most challenging aspect of the internship and job search is knowing where to start,” Rigby said, ""especially with all the stress of homework and exams on an engineering student’s mind. You will gain a lot of clarity about your next steps, and you’ll have a new resource for asking career questions any time.” Solutions Ira A.

Today, much robotic technology is developed without considering its potentially harmful effects on society, including how these technologies can infringe on privacy or further economic inequity. The new UT Austin program will fill an important educational gap by prioritizing these issues in its curriculum. “In the next 10 years, we are going to live more closely alongside robots, and we want to be sure that those robots are fair, inclusive and free from bias,” said Junfeng Jiao, associate professor in the School of Architecture and the program lead. “And because the robots we create are reflections of ourselves, it is imperative that technologists receive an excellent ethics education. We want our students to work directly with companies to create practices and technologies that are equitable and fair.” Called CREATE (Convergent, Responsible, and Ethical AI Training Experience for Roboticists), it will offer graduate coursework and professional development in responsible design and implementation. CREATE is a collaboration among Texas Robotics, industry partners and the UT grand challenge research initiative Good Systems , which seeks to design AI technologies that benefit society. The program has been recently awarded a $3 million grant from the National Science Foundation through its Research Traineeship Program , which will support 32 doctoral students to receive coursework, mentorship, professional development, internships, and research and public service opportunities. Students will focus specifically on how to ethically design, develop and deploy service robots, which can make deliveries, work in factories and clean homes. They will consider factors such as how to design delivery service robots so they are more inclusive and can reach all people and how to ensure home service robots protect occupants’ privacy. Several notable robotics companies have also said they will offer students internships, including Sony AI, Bosch, Amazon, SparkCognition and Apptronik. Researchers involved in the program cross many disciplines at UT, including computer science, architecture, engineering, information, and public affairs. Faculty members from these units will teach courses as part of the curriculum, and two faculty members will mentor each trainee during the five-year program. Additionally, each trainee will receive help with career development, grant writing, and exposure to local startup companies. More than half of the program’s trainees will be chosen from underrepresented groups in STEM education, including women and racial minorities, to help bring much-needed diversity to the field of robotics. The coursework component, which includes five classes in ethical robotics, will be institutionalized as a graduate portfolio program and will be available to all STEM graduate students at UT Austin. “This program will enable us to educate well-rounded roboticists who are not only grounded in the technical details of designing and building autonomous robots but also are equipped to fully consider the societal implications of their work,” said Peter Stone, director of Texas Robotics and a professor of computer science. “That is a missing part in robotics education in the U.S. and the world. We believe this is a game changer for the future of robotics.” /Public Release.

(OTC: SWRM ), a software development company and aggregator of mobile applications, announced it has been retained by GTX Corp (OTC: GTXO ), a pioneer in wearable technology and the health and safety wearable device market, to develop 'health analytics' utilizing artificial intelligence (A.I.) to assist in potentially extending the human life span. Health data analytics, also known as clinical data analytics, involves the extrapolation of actionable insights from sets of patient data, typically collected from electronic devices, such as wearables. Wearables can be employed from different body parts such as head-based, foot-based, eye-based, and wrist-based. Some examples of wearable data include steps taken, food and water intake, calories burned, sleep movement, and breathing. TulsaLabs will utilize data generated from wearable devices and sensors to develop cloud-based analytics that will monitor and analyze a user's health data through long-term dataset development, utilizing artificial intelligence. The A.I. powered platform will then allow users to look for potential trends that can then be offset with lifestyle adjustments to prevent the onset of some of the most common metabolic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. ""We are very excited at the idea of utilizing artificial intelligence and wearable data to help people live better and even possibly longer lives. Through predictive analytics, users will be able to find the best course of action for health on an individual basis. Developing personalized health data will assist users in avoiding some of the more common causes of metabolic diseases and help increase the quality-of-life for individuals, and society,"" stated Chris Bailey, the CEO of AppSwarm. Patrick Bertagna, the CEO of GTX Corp, commented, ""One thing COVID has brought to the forefront is how important health is to our longevity, so combining A.I. with wearables will greatly enhance our ability to develop and bring to market powerful health and wellness solutions. We look forward to working with Chris's team and having them join the longevity revolution with us.""

As it is currently evolving, the edge is taking distributed computing up another notch. Now, instead of having all of the server nodes that represent the cluster sitting in one place running one big job or several smaller ones that can be managed by a job scheduler and workload and configuration manager, the cluster will be spread across hundreds, or thousands, or potentially tens of thousands of physically distinct and very likely latency isolated compute and storage elements. These elements could be baby clusters or single nodes – it doesn’t really matter. What matters is that many of the same techniques that are used to manage a traditional HPC cluster can be extended out to manage the edge, which will very likely be running latency sensitive AI workloads that are, for all practical purposes, best thought of as HPC. “Given all of these possible scenarios, having a consistent management layer no matter the consumption model or the location eliminates some of the complexity of this different kind of massive scale,” says Bill Wagner, chief executive officer at Bright Computing. “We don’t look at the edge in isolation because we don’t think it exists in isolation. If you think about what the edge is actually doing, it is serving as an accelerant for machine learning analytics, ultimately. And so, edge is a component in a bunch of architectures for the datacenter and outside of the datacenter that are all converging from an infrastructure perspective. “Organizations want to tackle all this stuff in a consistent way and not have siloed approaches because they know they are going to need – and will have – infrastructure in many more places than they typically have today. Fast forward a couple of years and companies will have a hybrid infrastructure that is on premises, cloud, and edge. All this complexity relating to location is building and infrastructure is spreading out all over the place. Complexity is multiplying naturally at the same time, as new applications come into the fold and new technologies – new types of compute, storage, interconnects, and abstraction layers like containers – get deployed.” Because complex problems usually require complex answers, organizations also have to reckon with public clouds and bring them into the mix, too. In some cases, cloud infrastructure will be used exactly as an on-premises HPC cluster, built from compute, storage, and networking services on one of the major public clouds in an ephemeral or reserved manner, depending on the circumstances. In other cases, given the distributed nature of the largest public clouds, which have dozens of regions and hundreds of datacenters plus thousands of other points of presence – AWS calls them CloudFront Edge locations, Google Cloud calls them Network Edge locations or content delivery network points of presence (CDN POPs), and Microsoft calls them Azure Edge Zones – the public cloud will function like edge locations for organizations. The complexity is just a little more, well, complex than even this. The lines between what is an edge, what is a datacenter, and what is in between – and there will be points of presence in between, for sure – are blurring. And a common language has not developed to accurately describe this. The various layers of edge are just another flavor of distributed computing, where workloads have to be run closer to the source of data because latency has to be low or because datasets are too big to be transmitted from so many sites back to the datacenter, or both. Scale is going to explode on many different dimensions – within each location and across locations. It is like a fractal topology. But it is even stranger than that. In some cases, the public cloud will be your edge, or one of your edges. You will still need management . In other cases, the public cloud will be your datacenter. Still need management . Their clouds are your edge. Still need management . Their edge is my edge. Still need management . Those clouds are your datacenter. Still need management . Your datacenter is your datacenter and your edges are your edges. Still need management . There will be many types of edges, but the 5G wireless network where many applications will live is a good example. Applications running on 5G base stations will be enhanced with machine learning inference and possibly localized machine learning training to provide all of us services through our smartphones and maybe our laptops and tablets and VR headsets once we have a consistent, fairly cheap, high bandwidth, low latency network in place. The magnification of scale at the edge will be immense, which is why we are calling it hyperdistributed computing here at The Next Platform , as we see a complex of compute and memory and storage inside a server within a rack, across a row, spanning a datacenter, and stretching across the vastness of the edge out to tens of billions and eventually trillions of devices. “The telco example is telling,” says Wagner, reminding everyone that 4G wavelengths can span up to 10 miles, but 5G wavelengths are about 1,000 feet, and the tradeoff we have to pay for having 10X the bandwidth moving from 4G to 5G is to have a lot more cell antennas and cell towers.” With the transition from RAN to OpenRAN, the major telcos have around 170,000 sites distributed in the United States, and each of the major telcos have tens of thousands of cell towers each. But with 5G networks, the number of sites is predicted to be in the range of 400,000 to 500,000, and that may prove to be a very conservative estimate. The difficult thing, in the early days of hyperdistributed computing with varying levels of the tightness or looseness of the coupling in clusters of machines, is to bridge the gap for people who are still thinking about edge locations as pets and not as cattle . The underlying infrastructure has to be provisioned and managed in a consistent way, whether the machines are relatively tightly coupled, as is the case with HPC simulation and modeling clusters using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) stack or Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) to lash nodes together; or loosely couple – or they might not be coupled at all – a collection of Web servers in a datacenter, perhaps, or OpenRAN servers housed underneath cell base stations. “This has to be a unified infrastructure to help cope with the complexity, and it is best to think of this as clusters of clusters, with varying degrees of loose and tight coupling,” Wagner explains. “In the end, whether or not the machines talk to each other or not doesn’t really matter as much as the realization that they all need to be provisioned and managed. In a sense, there is nothing special about having to manage a lot of any particular thing or sets of things once you have a lot of them. The scale and diversity is the issue.” Because of the high cost of cloud computing, at a certain scale and utilization level, which we have talked about here at The Next Platform recently , it becomes cost prohibitive to be only on a public cloud and it becomes much less expensive to provide infrastructure in a facility that the company owns or at least controls if they rent their co-location space and use cloud-priced hardware inside of it. “This is why the term ‘edge’ is so limiting,” says Wagner with a certain amount of exasperation. “It suggests that there are only three scenarios, and what we want to help people do with Bright Cluster Manager is get people to see that at some point infrastructure should just be liquid and we have the tools that help it behave that way no matter where it is sourced, no matter how it is priced, and no matter where it is located.” Sponsored by Bright Computing.

Artificial intelligence is a key disruptive technology for the telecommunications industry, enabling service providers to expand their service offerings. However, telecommunications companies (telcos) have yet to harness AI's potential fully in their service offerings. Although it is in the nascent stage, telcos adopt AI to improve internal operations, such as optimizing networks, building future networks, and enhancing customer experience, marketing, and sales. Telcos currently embed AI analytics in customized IoT solutions instead of providing standalone AI-based tools, platforms, and services. Telecommunications operators are likely to move beyond service-level offerings to enterprise offerings integrating AI technology. The report examines use cases and business opportunity areas for telecommunications operators, including edge infrastructure and analytics, data science services, and industry-specific solutions. Key Insights While AI is yet to emerge as a mainstream telecommunications industry offering, telcos are embedding analytics in customized IoT solutions instead of providing them as standalone AI-based tools, platforms, and services. Given the massive volume of accessible data from IOT implementations, telcos can take advantage of early AI/ML deployments to enhance enterprise solutions' capabilities. As 5G deployments increase, telcos' accessibility to data will grow, enabling them to monetize emerging opportunities in enterprise solutions and support new use cases by leveraging AI.

September 9, 2021 Mick Kulikowski For Immediate Release Jacob Jones JacobJones@ncsu.edu Ross Sozzani rsozzan@ncsu.edu Mick Kulikowski mick_kulikowski@ncsu.edu 919.218.5937 North Carolina State University will lead a national research effort to reduce both dependence on mined phosphates and the amount of phosphorus that leaches into soil and water, the National Science Foundation announced today. The research will focus on issues relevant to both food security and environmental quality. The NSF Science and Technology Center – Science and Technologies for Phosphorus Sustainability (STEPS) – will be headquartered on NC State’s Centennial Campus. It is a joint effort between NC State and eight partner institutions. The center is funded by an initial five-year, $25 million grant that is renewable for an additional five years. Phosphorus sustainability is an important and urgent societal problem. An essential chemical element, phosphorus plays a critical role in fertilizers used in food systems. But there are problems with supply – the industry relies on mined, non-renewable phosphates that could soon be depleted – as well as system inefficiencies and downstream effects on the environment. “NC State is well positioned to produce effective solutions to societal challenges that require significant interdisciplinary work and innovation, and we’re pleased to be leading this crucial effort,” said NC State Chancellor Randy Woodson. “STEPS has ambitious goals that hold the potential to make a tremendous difference in phosphorus sustainability.” Those ambitious goals include facilitating a 25% reduction in human dependence on mined phosphates and a 25% reduction in phosphorus losses to soils and water resources within 25 years, leading to enhanced resilience of food systems and reduced environmental damage. Current food production systems rely heavily on phosphorus fertilizers, most of which originate from non-renewable phosphate deposits that are mined outside of the United States. Once in the food system, only 20% of the input phosphorus is ultimately incorporated into the human diet due to multiple system losses and inefficiencies. The “lost” phosphorus accumulates in soils and freshwater sources. Without intervention, the environmental, economic and sustainability issues involving phosphorus will escalate. “Phosphorus-driven algal blooms impair safe drinking water and marine life, and the increasing flux of phosphorus to oceans also leads to an expansion of coastal dead zones,” said Ross Sozzani, professor of plant and microbial biology at NC State and a center co-deputy director. “Without intervention, the environmental, economic and sustainability issues involving phosphorus will escalate as the world’s human population grows by another 2 billion people by 2050.” “STEPS develops the materials, technologies, and best management practices to recover, recycle, and reuse phosphorus,” said Jacob Jones, the center’s director and professor of materials science and engineering at NC State. “Recycling and reusing phosphorus means developing technologies and methods to capture “lost” phosphorus in soils and surface waters – as well as in animal and human waste – and then reusing that recycled phosphorus in fertilizers.” Ross Sozzani, professor of plant and microbial biology at NC State and a center co-deputy director “The establishment of STEPS is truly a watershed event,” said Jim Elser, Bierman Professor of Ecology at the University of Montana and a co-principal investigator on the project. “Globally, phosphorus loss from agriculture is now the main driver of water quality deterioration in lakes and rivers. Yet, extensive use of fertilizer phosphorus will still be essential for achieving food security in the coming decades. Squaring that circle is the “wicked problem” that STEPS will work to solve. This is really an exciting development that will move the center of gravity of the global phosphorus sustainability movement to the United States with the STEPS team leading the charge.” STEPS will be an interdisciplinary center, integrating contributions across the physical, life, social and economic sciences. The center’s headquarters will be housed in the new Plant Sciences Building , home of the university’s Plant Sciences Initiative , on NC State’s Centennial Campus. Researchers will draw from a wide variety of academic disciplines – ranging from agricultural engineering, biomolecular and chemical engineering, and materials science to chemistry, crop sciences, economics and sociology – to develop materials and technologies that can be deployed at the human scale while considering regional and global issues. We look forward to advancing agricultural solutions together. “The NC State University Plant Sciences Building, the future home of the N.C. Plant Sciences Initiative, is different by design,” said Richard Linton, dean of NC State’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. “It was built specifically to support interdisciplinary science teams from across different colleges, working on projects to tackle grand challenges. I couldn’t think of a better headquarters for STEPS. We look forward to advancing agricultural solutions together.” STEPS will also incorporate a more than 50-year phosphorus field trial experiment at Tidewater Research Station in Plymouth, N.C. In this experiment, differing amounts of phosphorus have been applied to crops to study factors such as phosphorus-deficiency resilience as well as how phosphorus already remaining in the soil – so-called legacy phosphorus – can still contribute as a nutrient for plants. STEPS will also leverage disciplinary contributions like team science and data science, while drawing on the expertise of industry partners to help guide the center’s work. These partners include stakeholders in agribusiness, municipal water and wastewater treatment, agriculture extension services and others. “By bringing all perspectives together at the beginning and throughout the research process, we enhance the impact of the materials and technologies that we develop for adoption,” Sozzani said. STEPS also has a strong inclusivity goal. STEPS will foster progress toward a goal of more than 50% participation by members of underrepresented minority groups, including more than 50% pre-baccalaureate participation to further broaden and develop the STEM pipeline. To ensure this goal is accomplished, STEPS will use proven theoretical approaches to ensure that all its participants, especially those from groups underrepresented in science and technology – including women, minorities and people with disabilities – have experiences in STEPS that lead to their retention and career progression. “This strong commitment to inclusivity and diversity is a testament to beneficial partnerships with organizations and institutions that allow us to recruit talented participants while strengthening new research collaborations,” said Louis Martin-Vega, dean of the College of Engineering at NC State. “Diversity in thought, culture, experience and approach toward problem solving is truly required to address a societal issue that no single discipline or group can solve on its own.” The STEPS team recognizes the impact the diverse backgrounds bring toward solving key societal problems. “The STEPS team recognizes the impact that diverse backgrounds bring toward solving key societal problems,” said Sherine O. Obare, dean of the Joint School of Nanoscience and Nanoengineering at North Carolina A&T State University and UNC Greensboro and a co-principal investigator on the project. “Delivering solutions that impact people from all backgrounds require that we address the problem using different perspectives that will benefit broader communities. Our goal is to broaden the participation and create an environment where we will leverage the brainpower of individuals from diverse groups to discover new knowledge in sustainability to find transformative solutions.” STEPS will engage the public in various ways, offering a new series of continuing education courses and a continuing education certificate. STEPS partner institutions include Arizona State University, Appalachian State University, the Joint School of Nanoscience and Engineering at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University and the University of North Carolina Greensboro, the University of Florida’s Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, Marquette University, RTI International, and the University of Illinois. Paul Westerhoff, a professor of environmental engineering at Arizona State, will serve as a center co-deputy director. NC State currently leads an active NSF Engineering Research Center called ASSIST, which develops self-powered health monitoring sensors and devices. The FREEDM Systems Center, a smart grid NSF ERC formed in 2008, is also headquartered at NC State. -kulikowski- Categories: Designing Healthy and Resilient Societies News Releases Research and Innovation Tags: college of agriculture and life sciences college of engineering fertilizer phosphorus sustainability View Comments 0 total responses Leave a Response Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

In 1750—over a century before most modern business schools were founded—Malachy Postlethwayt described a school of strikingly modern design. Postlethwayt, a British pamphleteer, was planning to establish a “Merchant’s Public Counting House” where young men would be “bred to Trade” with “great advantage.” For a period of two years, students would study an array of topics ranging from arbitrage to rates of exchange, the stock market, foreign languages, and written and spoken business communication. Merchants and bookkeeping instructors often taught short commercial courses, but Postlethwayt’s proposal stands out because it sounds strikingly like the modern MBA. Though it is unclear whether his vision materialized, Postlethwayt’s plans did describe the “gentlemen” who he expected to attend. Prominent on the list were “the sons of American planters”—the children of enslavers in North America and the Caribbean (Postlethwayt 1750). Many enslavers were keenly interested in pursuing commercial education. Some kept extraordinarily complex business records, and several even published manuals and textbooks on plantation accounting and management. Plantations even participated in the equivalent of early-modern internships: while cotton and sugar planters sent their sons north to New England and across the Atlantic to Europe to be educated, other merchants and tradesmen sent their sons to the West Indies for practical experience working as bookkeepers and agents on large slave plantations. As we would say today, they sharpened their data science skills and expanded their networks. Yet these early consumers of business education—many of whom went on to own plantations and be enslavers themselves—aren’t widely covered by modern business schools. Business schools largely omit this history from their courses, even though many enslavers had built large and complex organizations, developed standardized reporting forms, and used appreciation and depreciation to value their (human) capital assets. Cotton planters tracked the number of pounds of cotton picked by every man, woman, and child, devising all kinds of strategies for accelerating the pace of labor. Business schools and students pitch themselves as change-makers. But too often the heady assumption is that change will be good—that doing good and doing well align naturally. Or, worse, that bigger change will be better change. Businesses can, of course, do lots of good, but it is neither universal nor inevitable, and the business history of slavery offers a powerful antidote to such assumptions. Planters’ brutal practices show just how much it is possible to overlook in the pursuit of profit. Big Lessons from Old Data Today, the history of slavery offers more than a general cautionary tale. The calculations of enslavers—made clear in their account books—provide detailed paper spreadsheets of output, valuations, and lives. These documents offer insights about how numbers and balance sheets can erase some things even as they make others visible. Take this example from Friendship Plantation (Figure 1), a sugar estate in British Guiana where a community of 329 enslaved people lived and worked in August 1828. The plantation used a pre-printed form—a kind of dashboard—to track key performance indicators. This form would have been completed using data gathered from other account books used on the plantation and then sent across the Atlantic so that the proprietor could manage business from afar. Monthly dashboard of data used to manage Friendship plantation, 1828. Credit: Wilberforce House, Hull City Museums and Art Galleries, UK© Hull and East Riding Museum/Bridgeman Images At the top of the form is a summary account of the enslaved people toiling on the plantation. Each person is listed in two ways—first by occupation or activity, and again by age and sex. Down the left-hand side, the form listed the many categories of labor required to run a plantation. The overseer or bookkeeper who filled out this form made additional notations, for example penciling in “Smiths” next to “Masons” and “Cooks” next to “Nurses.” At the bottom, the bookkeeper categorized those who could not work full-time, including any who were “In the Hospital,” “Invalids and Aged,” and “Children under 12 years.” Across the top enslaved people were classified again by age and sex, as Men, Women, Boys, Girls, and Children. Both row and column summed to 329, reassuring the proprietor that all had been accounted for. The report, in short, gave the absentee owner an instant “read-out” of his human property. Below the account of enslaved people, the bookkeeper filled in key details on the production of sugar and livestock. At bottom, he summarized the progress of the planting and the availability of plantains for food. Of course, reading this chart today, we are acutely aware of what is missing: nothing of the lives of the 329 men, women, and children; nothing of the brutal violence and dislocation that these individuals endured. The immense human costs of plantation slavery can only be read from between the lines. Learning from Discomfort When I use plantation account books to reconstruct planters’ reasoning, the process makes me uncomfortable. Part of it is the horror of the system: though few forms tallied up punishments like whippings, we know they were common. We also know that the threat of sale was used to terrorize individuals who would be separated from their homes and loved ones. What also makes me uneasy is how easily this brutality is hidden from view. Data offered planters distance. It helped them to treat enslaved laborers as inputs of production rather than as people. Modern data can function in similar ways, offering decision-makers distance from human considerations: executives reviewing the numbers rarely know the people the numbers represent. We can use this history to critique our own data practices. What costs do calculations highlight, and which do they overlook? And what kinds of behavior are normalized when numbers make exploitation easier to ignore? Parallel questions about what data misses might include: What do managers miss when user well-being goes unmeasured? What kinds of organizations result from focusing too narrowly on a particular metric like labor cost? Considering enslavers’ data reveals just how much it is possible to overlook in the pursuit of profit (Rosenthal 2019, 2021). The businesspeople who relied on plantation records knew slavery was immoral but chose to look away. The slave trade was abolished more than two decades before 1828, the date of the Friendship dashboard. Slavery itself would soon be banned and gradually eliminated from the British Empire. As Sven Beckert (2017) has reflected: When you read the letters of businessmen of the 1840s and 1850s, you see numerous efforts to separate business and morality into distinct realms. Merchants and manufacturers in the past did know that slavery was a moral problem, but then they tried to say that such moral considerations were extraneous to the concerns of business. Starting Conversations for Truth and Reparations Many resources are available for teaching about the history of slavery in business education. For example, a course on financial innovation—or any class covering the 2008 financial crisis—might draw on Edward Baptist’s short provocative piece (2010), “Toxic Debt, Liar Loans, and Securitized Human Beings.” A course on valuation practices might draw on Daina Ramey Berry’s work on the way enslaved people were valued across their lifecycle: from before birth to after death, when bodies were sometimes sold in the cadaver trade (2017). Even more powerful are original documents. Gridded account books constitute the spreadsheets of the 18 th and 19 th centuries. Students can examine how enslavers tracked how much cotton enslaved people picked each day and kept lists stating the financial value of each person’s body. Students studying commoditization can see traders callously sorting enslaved people into standard categories , pricing children by height and describing them as they would bushels of wheat and bales of cotton. They can consider the implications of using people as collateral for mortgages . Communities of every age and ability were reduced to fractions of people —a practice both radically different from yet parallel to the modern practice of accounting for employees as a percentage of an FTE [full-time employee]. Such documents can foster broader conversations about how businesspeople can, should, and do behave when the most profitable decisions are clearly unethical. In many cases, the lessons drawn can go beyond analogy. Online databases make it easy to connect history to the present day by following the money. When slavery was abolished in the British Empire, enslavers received financial compensation. The “Legacies of British Slave Ownership” project , hosted by University College London, lets readers track these payouts easily, seeing who was compensated and the many commercial firms funded in part by those payouts, including leading railroads and banks. Similar connections can be seen through Michael Ralph and Bill Rankin’s work (2017) on insurance of enslavers’ human property , which documents and maps their importance to companies like New York Life, Aetna, and AIG. Recent research by Mehrsa Baradaran (2014) and Destin Jenkins (2021) shows how banks and other financial intermediaries have helped maintain structural racism to the present day. While the US receives the most attention, scholars have also examined how slavery shaped many other countries—for example, Pepjin Brandon and Ulbe Bosma (2019) have analyzed the importance of trading of enslaved people to the 18 th century Dutch republic. These resources offer opportunities for us to think about connections and complicity, then and now. What are the responsibilities of businesses beyond their own present-day operations? How should businesspeople think about the practices of their suppliers and contractors? What about the sources of their funding? Rethinking Business Education When history makes it into business classrooms, the focus is often on successes and the investors, managers, and entrepreneurs that students should emulate. But cautionary tales, such as those outlined from the history of slavery here, can be at least as valuable. The dangers of not thinking critically about conventional business practices should be clear. Inspired by historical cases like this, we should ask ourselves, and encourage our students to interrogate, how the practices promoted in business school classrooms today might be viewed in 10—or 250—years.

Updated: September 13, 2021 @ 8:07 pm Full Forecast News Weather Sports Wake Up Connections COVID-19 AP AWS and Bundesliga to Debut Two New Bundesliga Match Facts for the 2021–22 European Football Season Sep 9, 2021 Sep 9, 2021 Updated Sep 9, 2021 Comments Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sep 9, 2021-- Today, Amazon Web Services (AWS), an Amazon.com , Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), and the German Bundesliga, Germany’s top national football league, announced two new Bundesliga Match Facts powered by AWS that will premier as graphics during broadcasts and in the official Bundesliga app during the 2021 – 22 season. The first advanced stat, Shot Efficiency, compares the actual number of goals that a player or team has scored with how many goals the player or team should have scored based on the quality of their chances. The second, Passing Profile, provides deeper insights into the pass quality of a player or an entire team. Both stats will debut during Matchday 4 on September 11, 2021, featuring the faceoff between German Champion FC Bayern München and the second-place team of the previous season, RB Leipzig. For more information, videos, and blogs about each stat, visit aws.amazon.com/sports/bundesliga . This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210909005938/en/ Passing Profile, one of the new Bundesliga Match Facts powered by AWS for the 21-22 season. (Graphic: Business Wire) Bundesliga Match Facts help audiences better understand nuanced aspects of the game of football, such as decision making on the pitch or what goes into exceptional player performance. Bundesliga generates the Match Facts by gathering and analyzing the match feeds from live games in real time as they’re streamed into AWS. On the backend, Bundesliga uses AWS capabilities in analytics, machine learning, compute, storage, database, serverless, and media services to process and store the vast amount of data that powers these statistics, as well as to train, deploy, and scale the machine learning models used to generate predictions. Fans see the insights as graphics during broadcasts, with additional details in the official Bundesliga app. The two new Match Facts will better showcase the action on the field and give fans, coaches, players, and commentators visual support for analyzing players’ and teams’ performance. New Bundesliga Match Facts for the 2021–22 season powered by AWS Shot Efficiency: Football fans love to revisit and break down scoring opportunities to better celebrate or mourn key game moments. This new stat helps fans determine which players or teams best exploit their chances at scoring a goal. It compares the number of goals that a player or team has actually scored with the cumulative value from Expected Goals (xGoals)—an existing Bundesliga Match Fact—which is the number of goals the player or team should have scored based on the quality of their attempted shots. The difference between these two values is the Shot Efficiency number. If the value is negative (shown on TV by a red arrow pointing down), the player or team has scored fewer goals than would have been expected. If the value is positive (green arrow up), the player or team exceeded the expected value. For the first time, each player’s efficiency can be objectively assessed based on the overall quality of shots and the number of goals scored. For example, this advanced stat can compare two strikers who scored the same number of goals after 10 matchdays to determine which player is converting goals in challenging versus easy situations. Commentators can also use the stat, for instance, to analyze if players have a high number of goals because they are well supported by their teammates or because they exploit openings in the defense. Passing Profile: Fans often put themselves into a player’s shoes and compare the choices they might have made in a given situation to what the player actually did. This new stat helps fans understand how players think and decide where to pass the ball. It also provides deeper insights into the pass quality and pass strength of players and teams, including which passing decisions they prioritize, such as an offensive pass, passing the ball back, or opening up play with a long ball. Before Passing Profile, the effectiveness of player passing was measured primarily by the number of passes that successfully reach a player’s target; now, with Passing Profile, it is possible to assess the quality of passes too, accounting for pass difficulty. For instance, by looking at how many opponents press the recipient and passer, how high the ball is in the air, and how many opponents were positioned between the recipient and passer, the stat calculates the pass difficulty rating. It also offers further insights into the passing behavior of a player or team by identifying the number of long and short passes, pass direction, and the type of passes a player favors. To develop these stats, machine learning models trained on Amazon SageMaker (AWS’s service that enables data scientists and developers to build, train, and deploy machine learning models quickly) analyzed thousands of video hours of previous Bundesliga seasons. In the case of Shot Efficiency, Bundesliga trained its machine learning models on a dataset of more than 40,000 historical shots on goal, which includes features derived from player positional data, such as distance to goal, angle to goal, player speed, number of defenders in the line of a shot, and goalkeeper coverage. In the case of Passing Profile, Bundesliga analyzed video of nearly 2 million passes and used that data to construct an algorithm that computes a difficulty score for each pass at any moment, evaluating characteristics such as distance to the receiver, the number of defending players in between, and pressure on a player. Once computed, Bundesliga aggregates difficulty scores for each player and team to form a passing profile. “Bundesliga Match Facts powered by AWS allow us to give fans more insight into the game of football, broadcasters more interesting stories to tell, and coaches and teams more data to excel at their game. Last year, the reception for Bundesliga Match Facts around the world was very positive, and we will continue to raise the bar and innovate on these analytics using machine learning to make them even better. The two new stats for this season give fans a view into player efficiency that hasn’t been achieved before, and we are still just at the beginning of our relationship with AWS. I’m excited to see how technology will continue to evolve the fan experience and the game,” said Andreas Heyden, Executive Vice President of Digital Innovations for DFL Deutsche Fußball Liga (DFL) Group. “Teams, leagues, broadcasters, and their partners from across the sports world are using AWS to build data-driven solutions and elevate the fan experience. We’re excited to continue our work with Bundesliga to connect with their fans in a way they haven’t been able to before this collaboration,” said Klaus Buerg, General Manager for AWS Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, Amazon Web Services EMEA SARL. “Through the work we’ve accomplished with Bundesliga in creating eight Bundesliga Match Facts in a short period of time, we are giving fans a new way to appreciate player speed, field positioning, goals, passing, and shot efficiency, creating even more excitement in watching the game.” These two new Match Facts join Speed Alert , Goal Probability, xGoals , Most Pressed Player , Attacking Zones , and Average Positions: Trends to bring the total number of insights available for Bundesliga fans to eight. Information on all of these statistics can be found at aws.amazon.com/sports/bundesliga/ . Football fans also can follow all of the latest Bundesliga action on Bundesliga.com and via the official Facebook , Twitter , and Instagram channels.

ABSTRACT The current pandemic outbreak clearly indicated the urgent need for tools allowing fast predictions of bioactivity of a large number of compounds, either available or at least synthesizable. In the computational chemistry toolbox, several such tools are available, with the main ones being docking and structure-activity relationship modeling either by classical linear QSAR or Machine Learning techniques. In this contribution, we focus on the comparison of the results obtained using different docking protocols on the example of the search for bioactivity of compounds containing N-N-C(S)-N scaffold at the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 virus with ACE2 human receptor interface. Based on over 1800 structures in the training set we have predicted binding properties of the complete set of nearly 600000 structures from the same class using the Machine Learning Random Forest Regressor approach.

File photo Chennai : After the enrolment came to a close, the Directorate of Technical Education (DoTE) said about 1.38 lakh students have completed the process of enrolment, uploaded certificates and made payment for registration. Dr T Purushothaman, Additional Director of Higher Education Department and Tamil Nadu Engineering Admissions (TNEA-2021) in-charge, told DT Next that Computer Science with specialisation in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Language seems to be favourite among the students this year. “The exact number of students who have opted for Computer Science course will be compiled only after the publishing the rank list,” he said. Another Higher Education Department official pointed out that competition would be intense for computer science this year, as the Class 12 marks were calculated from SSLC and Class 11 scores. According to him, approximately 60 per cent of engineering aspirants would have opted for either B Tech Computer Science or BE Computer Science, besides IT-related courses. A few years ago, electrical and electronics engineering (EEE) was the top choice, the official said, adding how instrumentation and civil engineering were the least favourite. “The importance of Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning has been increasing, as a growing number of MNCs are adopting these technologies to improve products and services, evaluate business models and enhance their decision-making process,” he said. K Ramakumar, one of the aspirants who secured 80% marks based on Classes 10 and 11, and internals is hoping to get a seat for either computer science or IT. “It would fetch a job immediately after completing the course,” he explained. S Kalaiselvi, who falls among the 7.5% quota for government school student, said: “I don’t mind even if I get Computer Science course in a college in other districts. I hope the course would help get immediate employment.” Related Tags : Computer science  | engineering aspirants Share Tweet Comments ( ) Mail Print A A × Email this article to a friend Recipient's Name Recipient’s Email Id Your Name Your Email Id Message in details Send Conversations More News - Tamil Nadu Tamil Nadu logs 1,608 new cases, 22 deaths Sep 13, 2021 12:00 AM UPSC exams in regional languages: HC asks UnionHome Secy to issue order Sep 13, 2021 12:00 AM Grant provisional admission to pvt students: AICTE Sep 12, 2021 11:59 PM TN MBBS aspirant dies by suicide, AIADMK slams govt, CM promises Bill to exempt state from NEET Sep 12, 2021 09:35 PM Mass vaccination drive in Tamil Nadu touches 28 lakh in a single day Sep 12, 2021 09:12 PM Subramania Bharathi’s important books to be translated to English: Stalin Sep 12, 2021 08:45 PM News Chennai Tamil Nadu Nation World Sports Cinema Business Citizen Truth Exposed Madras Week Food History Memories Events Chennai Landmarks Lifestyle Wellbeing Going Viral Fashion Technology Spirituality Specials World Test Championship Tokyo Olympics India vs Sri Lanka T20 India vs England TNPL Cricket About Us Terms of Use Privacy Policy Contact Us Feedback Sitemap Paper Ad Tariff Web Ad Tariff Copyright @ 2021, Daily Thanthi.

For most, the preferred point of view is risk-based. A policy response is framed in military-diplomatic terms, generally a proposal for increased capability and support for the ANZUS alliance. However, such an approach downplays other potential threat offsets, namely non-risk based opportunities. Take China, for instance, and the danger its rhetoric and actions pose to the established order in the Western Pacific. That China is a national security concern is hard to dispute, but the response need not be solely a military-diplomatic one. Security assessments that leverage opportunities found in other parts of Australian society also have the potential to enhance the nation’s security. The current opportunities Australia can exploit — among others — are the technologies associated with the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) and renewable energy. In combination, both will create new approaches to energy production and manufacturing that have the potential to build a wealthier, stronger and more resilient Australia. This is not a futurist prediction. Both revolutions are already underway and other countries have begun to take advantage of the opportunities they offer. The Australian government’s interest in renewable energy is even less impressive, and can best be described as hostile and backward-looking. The leaders in adopting 4IR technologies and principles are the United States, China, Germany and Japan. Australia is a distant laggard. The Australian Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources has published a policy, which it calls Industry 4.0, and is in the process of setting up a pilot program with academia, but it is all pretty low-level and rather anaemic. It is certainly not a priority. A report by KPMG highlights in strong terms how unprepared Australian businesses are for the technological changes the 4IR will bring. The Australian government’s interest in renewable energy is even less impressive, and can best be described as hostile and backward-looking . Advances in additive manufacturing (also known as 3D printing), distributed or decentralised production, digital processing, artificial intelligence and nano-biology, for example, are already reshaping how and where products are designed and made. Convergence, driven by the internet of things , is creating networks of buyers and sellers in ways previously unimaginable and at the same time destroying existing systems of manufacturing, distribution and sale. Renewables, such as solar and wind, have plummeted in price and now cost less than any fossil fuel-based electricity production. The development of networks creates the opportunity for the efficient and productive exchange of information and energy. Once those networks are linked, distributed energy, like manufacturing, becomes possible, with small producers buying and selling energy. The cost of producing renewable energy has plummeted and is now less than any fossil fuel-based electricity production ( Mikael Kristenson /Unsplash) We should remember how quickly such transitions can occur. There was a time when few could imagine a need for the personal computer, yet, today half the world’s households have at least one, while mobile phones have more power than the mainframes of old. There is a historical urgency for Australia to seize the opportunities presented by the 4IR and the renewable revolutions if it is to secure its future. National security is ultimately about power and influence, and power typically follows the creation of wealth. Those states that grasp the opportunities of the 4IR early­ – as did the United Kingdom in the days of the First Industrial Revolution – are more likely to create conditions in which their people prosper and have the opportunity to shape their own destinies. Those who are laggards will again struggle to compete under the conditions of this new industrial age. Security thinkers must widen the debate on Australia’s future security and the country’s place in the world. They need to highlight the potential of the revolutionary technologies that are coming into service to strengthen Australia both materially and morally. There is precedent for advocating such a position. At the turn of the 20th Century, social welfare movements in Europe and the United States strove to improve the health, education and well-being of the non-elites. There was both altruistic and moral motivation in these efforts – the belief that a more capable, healthier and educated population made for a stronger and more powerful state. National security was not far from the minds of legislators who advanced numerous reforms to society. Even the Scout and Guide movements originated out of a desire to develop fitter and more capable young boys and girls who would be of greater value to the state. China and climate change present multiple risks to Australia that require different solutions on different levels. By not including opportunity in their analysis, national security thinkers are limiting solutions to the risk side of the defence equation. The result is a one-dimensional discourse that is not as useful as it could be. Highlighting 4IR opportunities, such as the potential for additive manufacturing to grow Australia’s industrial base, or the utility of information convergence to improve efficiency, could lead to policies and initiatives that allow Australia to better its position relative to other states. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions and switching to renewable energy production, for example, would eliminate the current much riskier energy policy, namely Australia’s dependence on imported liquid fuels. China and climate change present multiple risks to Australia that require different solutions on different levels. Australia’s goal in regards to China is to avoid becoming a client state or worse a satrapy, while to counter climate change will require not only zero emissions but also a more resilient and adaptive society. Each of these risks requires different solutions which make for a more complicated response. By embracing the opportunities of the 4IR and renewable energy revolutions, Australia may generate the wealth to help offset China’s dominance while providing the technologies and design systems to address climate change. The prospect of creating a single solution for two problems is one worth exploring and one in which security commentators should be taking an active interest.

Copy URL Share a link Share on Email Facebook Twitter Linked In Reddit Wechat Abstract The high brightness, low emittance electron beams achieved in modern X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) have enabled powerful X-ray imaging tools, allowing molecular systems to be imaged at picosecond time scales and sub-nanometer length scales. One of the most promising directions for increasing the brightness of XFELs is through the development of novel photocathode materials. Whereas past efforts aimed at discovering photocathode materials have typically employed trial-and-error-based iterative approaches, this work represents the first data-driven screening for high brightness photocathode materials. Through screening over 74 000 semiconducting materials, a vast photocathode dataset is generated, resulting in statistically meaningful insights into the nature of high brightness photocathode materials. This screening results in a diverse list of photocathode materials that exhibit intrinsic emittances that are up to 4x lower than currently used photocathodes. In a second effort, multiobjective screening is employed to identify the family of M 2 O (M = Na, K, Rb) that exhibits photoemission properties that are comparable to the current state-of-the-art photocathode materials, but with superior air stability. This family represents perhaps the first intrinsically bright, visible light photocathode materials that are resistant to reactions with oxygen, allowing for their transport and storage in dry air environments.

Prof Bhaskar Ramamurthi, director, IIT Madras, shares how Covid-19 has changed the classroom Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT Madras) has been ranked the best institute in India in both ‘Overall’ and ‘Engineering’ categories in the National Institute Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2021, released last week. While it has bagged the top rank in ‘Overall’ category for the third consecutive year, in ‘Engineering’ IIT Madras has been at the top for six consecutive years. Prof Bhaskar Ramamurthi, director, IIT Madras, shares with FE’s Vikram Chaudhary how Covid-19 has changed the classroom, the initiatives IIT Madras has been taking towards internationalisation, and why rankings are important but should not be the end-goal. Excerpts: How easy or difficult is it for IITs to align with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020? Related News PM Modi to lay foundation stone of university named after noted Jat figure Need of quality education in the time of Covid-19 Kerala Plus One Trial Allotment 2021 likely to be out today: Here’s how to check We were able to anticipate and implement in advance many of the recommendations of the NEP. These include multidisciplinary education, multiple exit pathways, and so on. For example, at IIT Madras, a student can pivot from one branch to another, pursuing a double degree such as aerospace with data science; we have 10-12 such upgrade pathways and these are getting popular amongst students. Today, a student can decide which stream to master in even after three years of study. Similarly, the NEP focuses on online education; through the National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning (NPTEL)—the world’s largest online repository of courses in basic sciences, engineering and select humanities and social sciences subjects—we have been experimenting with online education for about 10 years. We also launched the online BSc in Programming and Data Science degree course last year. Will you also host MOOCs to attract foreign students, like IIT Bombay has done with edX? Our NPTEL courses are taken up by a lot of people from outside India, and the BSc online degree we are planning to offer abroad, but because of the pandemic we have gone a little slow. We conduct exams in person, because integrity is important, but due to the pandemic our ability to conduct exams in person is limited. We are working with partners in foreign countries. The aim is to ensure that our online degrees are in no way inferior to on-campus degrees. How many PhD students do you currently host? We have about 3,000 PhD students and about 1,000 MS (by Research) students, so 40% of our student population is into research. Since inception, we have readied 5,600 PhD students and 4,000 MS (by Research) students—an average of 100 per year (from 1964-65 till 2014). Since 2014, IIT Madras and other IITs have been ramping up their PhD student intake, and we are graduating about 400 PhD students per year. This number (5,600 PhDs) will double in about 12 years. The need for PhD students is much higher right now; industry is doing much more R&D than it used to earlier. Has Covid-19 changed the way IITs will teach students? Before the pandemic some faculty members (especially younger ones) used to record lectures and upload on the cloud so that students could revisit these. Faculty like me were more chalk and talk. After the lockdown, all faculty members have gotten comfortable with online teaching. While we will go back to classroom teaching, we will have a much more flexible and hybrid approach. How will it benefit students? It will give them a lot more flexibility. Before the pandemic, an IIT Madras student had to be on campus physically; she could take a couple of days off, but classroom experience was a must. Going forward, students may be able to take a couple of weeks of a course online. Some things have changed forever. Even our admission process for PhD students will change. Earlier, students were required on the campus for interviews, but now we realise it was self-limiting. We are doing online interviews, saving a lot of their and our time, and have been able to reach out to some bright students from the hinterland. Have you already started changing the classroom at IIT Madras? Yes, we have started upgrading our classroom. Everything being taught is also going onto the cloud. While face-to-face teaching remains important, it will turn from simply writing on the board and transmitting information to a much more interactive process. Even with the faculty we have realised that productivity has gone up massively during the lockdown. What are your views on global rankings? Seven IITs (including IIT Madras) continue to boycott the Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings… Rankings, global or domestic, are important, but these shouldn’t be the end-goal. Taking the analogy of a classroom of 50 students, there will be toppers and those that don’t rank high. It doesn’t mean that the topper will do something unusual in life and that the 50th ranked student won’t. As far as global rankings are concerned, these don’t really help an Indian student select an Indian college. Does this imply that the NIRF is more important (for Indian institutes and students) than global rankings? Among other things, the NIRF has put hitherto unknown colleges in the student’s consideration set. For example, a college from Trichy getting ranked high on the NIRF will get into the consideration set of a student from north India as well. Have any job offers been cancelled for IIT Madras students due to the pandemic? IIT students are perceived, and rightly so, as being the cream of the crop; I don’t think a lot of our students lost job offers specifically due to the pandemic. Last year, job offers of 28-odd students were taken back, and but we were able to place many of them by running a second round of placements; this year, 14-15 students had the job offers taken away, but I am sure they’ll get placed. Why even the best of Indian institutes are not able to attract as many global students as colleges in, let’s say, UK or Australia do? We must understand that when students go to those countries for higher studies, they also want to work there. Unless India becomes an employment destination for foreigners in a big way, I don’t think we will get as many foreign students. Tell me why Indian students go to Australia to study? One reason is that most cannot get into a similarly good university in India (due to the competition). Another reason is they know they can work in Australia for some time (at high wages). The reason for going there to study is also employment. But doesn’t studying in a multicultural and multinational campus give them an edge? Certain foreign universities boldly declare that an advantage they have is global outlook… It definitely does. But also understand that some universities in the US, Australia, England and other countries have students from multiple nationalities because their survival depends on such students. They will collapse if they don’t get foreign students, and that’s why they play up such advantages (diversity on the campus). At the same time, a lot of these countries also depend on high-quality immigration. As long as Indian companies will continue hiring majorly Indians for various reasons (including the fact that there are so many qualified Indians looking for a job), I don’t think we can expect a similar kind of rush to Indian universities. How feasible is imparting engineering education in vernacular languages, both from a classroom point of view (availability of good teachers) and from a working life point of view (the knowledge of English may give Indians an advantage)? I don’t buy the second argument. Most MNCs have bigger centres in China than anywhere else in the world, and the Chinese don’t speak English, nor do Germans or Koreans or Japanese. We are the only major country that has been teaching higher education in a foreign language. From a student’s point of view, if you go to the hinterland, a lot of students have done their schooling in a local language, and many of them are from a relatively deprived background. Now if they have to deal with language once they enter an engineering college, it can get tough for them. The time has come for us to remove the language barrier for students. You can learn English on the fly during and after your engineering as well. But what about finding good vernacular teachers in engineering? Today, if you ask me to teach engineering in Tamil, I will likely mix Tamil and English to teach. Remember, students are not learning literature here, they are learning engineering, and that dissemination of knowledge should be in the tone they understand.

Singularity Hub Topics Experts Events Videos Singularity University SingularityU Global Subscribe to our newsletter Topics New Study Finds a Single Neuron Is a Surprisingly Complex Little Computer By Jason Dorrier - Sep 12, 2021 2,390 Comparing brains to computers is a long and dearly held analogy in both neuroscience and computer science. It’s not hard to see why. Our brains can perform many of the tasks we want computers to handle with an easy, mysterious grace. So, it goes, understanding the inner workings of our minds can help us build better computers ; and those computers can help us better understand our own minds. Also, if brains are like computers, knowing how much computation it takes them to do what they do can help us predict when machines will match minds. Indeed, there’s already a productive flow of knowledge between the fields. Deep learning, a powerful form of artificial intelligence , for example, is loosely modeled on the brain’s vast, layered networks of neurons. You can think of each “node” in a deep neural network as an artificial neuron. Like neurons, nodes receive signals from other nodes connected to them and perform mathematical operations to transform input into output. Depending on the signals a node receives, it may opt to send its own signal to all the nodes in its network. In this way, signals cascade through layer upon layer of nodes, progressively tuning and sharpening the algorithm. The brain works like this too. But the keyword above is loosely. Scientists know biological neurons are more complex than the artificial neurons employed in deep learning algorithms, but it’s an open question just how much more complex. In a fascinating paper published recently in the journal Neuron , a team of researchers from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem tried to get us a little closer to an answer. While they expected the results would show biological neurons are more complex—they were surprised at just how much more complex they actually are. In the study, the team found it took a five- to eight-layer neural network, or nearly 1,000 artificial neurons, to mimic the behavior of a single biological neuron from the brain’s cortex. Though the researchers caution the results are an upper bound for complexity—as opposed to an exact measurement of it—they also believe their findings might help scientists further zero in on what exactly makes biological neurons so complex. And that knowledge, perhaps, can help engineers design even more capable neural networks and AI. “[The result] forms a bridge from biological neurons to artificial neurons,” Andreas Tolias, a computational neuroscientist at Baylor College of Medicine, told Quanta last week. Amazing Brains Neurons are the cells that make up our brains. There are many different types of neurons, but generally, they have three parts: spindly, branching structures called dendrites, a cell body, and a root-like axon. On one end, dendrites connect to a network of other neurons at junctures called synapses. At the other end, the axon forms synapses with a different population of neurons. Each cell receives electrochemical signals through its dendrites, filters those signals, and then selectively passes along its own signals (or spikes). To computationally compare biological and artificial neurons, the team asked: How big of an artificial neural network would it take to simulate the behavior of a single biological neuron? First, they built a model of a biological neuron (in this case, a pyramidal neuron from a rat’s cortex). The model used some 10,000 differential equations to simulate how and when the neuron would translate a series of input signals into a spike of its own. They then fed inputs into their simulated neuron, recorded the outputs, and trained deep learning algorithms on all the data. Their goal? Find the algorithm that could most accurately approximate the model. (Video: A model of a pyramidal neuron (left) receives signals through its dendritic branches. In this case, the signals provoke three spikes.) They increased the number of layers in the algorithm until it was 99 percent accurate at predicting the simulated neuron’s output given a set of inputs. The sweet spot was at least five layers but no more than eight, or around 1,000 artificial neurons per biological neuron. The deep learning algorithm was much simpler than the original model—but still quite complex. From where does this complexity arise? As it turns out, it’s mostly due to a type of chemical receptor in dendrites—the NMDA ion channel—and the branching of dendrites in space. “Take away one of those things, and a neuron turns [into] a simple device,” lead author David Beniaguev tweeted in 2019 , describing an earlier version of the work published as a preprint. Indeed, after removing these features, the team found they could match the simplified biological model with but a single-layer deep learning algorithm. A Moving Benchmark It’s tempting to extrapolate the team’s results to estimate the computational complexity of the whole brain. But we’re nowhere near such a measure. For one, it’s possible the team didn’t find the most efficient algorithm. It’s common for the the developer community to rapidly improve upon the first version of an advanced deep learning algorithm. Given the intensive iteration in the study, the team is confident in the results, but they also released the model, data, and algorithm to the scientific community to see if anyone could do better. Also, the model neuron is from a rat’s brain, as opposed to a human’s, and it’s only one type of brain cell. Further, the study is comparing a model to a model—there is, as of yet, no way to make a direct comparison to a physical neuron in the brain. It’s entirely possible the real thing is more, not less, complex. Still, the team believes their work can push neuroscience and AI forward. In the former case, the study is further evidence dendrites are complicated critters worthy of more attention. In the latter, it may lead to radical new algorithmic architectures. Idan Segev, a coauthor on the paper, suggests engineers should try replacing the simple artificial neurons in today’s algorithms with a mini five-layer network simulating a biological neuron. “We call for the replacement of the deep network technology to make it closer to how the brain works by replacing each simple unit in the deep network today with a unit that represents a neuron, which is already—on its own—deep,” Segev said. Whether so much added complexity would pay off is uncertain. Experts debate how much of the brain’s detail algorithms need to capture to achieve similar or better results. But it’s hard to argue with millions of years of evolutionary experimentation. So far, following the brain’s blueprint has been a rewarding strategy. And if this work is any indication, future neural networks may well dwarf today’s in size and complexity. Image Credit: NICHD/S.

But scientists and doctors are warning of a third wave of Covid and this time it may be nastier variants. The spirit of devotion is running high but in socially distant times rather than participate in crowded physical festival celebrations, it may be best to sign up for god dotcom. We could upload our prayers and live-stream our consciousness. Many of us already chant Om Googleshwar Namah on a daily basis. Last year, Durga Pujas took the lead in cyber ceremonies with video aartis and conch shell sounds transmitted via headphones. Metaphysically speaking, if the infinite is to be perceived by the human senses, what better way than tuning into cyberspace to experience cosmic waves? Artificial intelligence and supercomputers are in any case being hailed as the gods of the future. Instead of jostling in jam-packed temples, where coronavirus lies in wait, if the gods go online we may gain much better divine connectivity. Video gamers are already playing God games but for the truly pious, excellent broadband could provide high-speed blessings. A divine download could be the best way to clean up our hard disks. In times of Zoom rituals and Skype havans, many of us are karma yogis of the keyboard and when it comes to the steady flow of virtual devotion, we Indians don’t need a UPS. Quipped the internet wag: Computers already have in-built RAM. The Maharashtra government had given instructions that citizens are permitted only online darshan during Ganesh Chaturthi this year. Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal celebrated Ganesh Chaturthi via a live streamed puja. Why not? Well-loved Ganesh has always been the god of the Indian workforce. If Ganesh images can be painted on taxis and trawlers, why can’t Ganpati Bappa come to life in our home computers? Ganesh is part of the software of our daily lives. Websites like smartpuja dotcom show that to find the sacred we must increasingly be smart. In times of climate fragility, too many teeming pilgrimages to pristine locales could bring on unforeseen natural calamities. For planetary health, as well as spiritual succour, there could be nothing better than logging on to the Almighty. God is dead, proclaimed the philosopher Nietzsche. Not if you have good quality 4G, we could argue.

1.31E+19,The psychological concept that may change how you process your emotions - Inverse,https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/mental-life-psychology-emotions,2021-09-12 14:01:21+00:00,2021-09-12 14:01:21+00:00,"... whether to fear or embrace <b>artificial intelligence</b>, and how to interact with any supernatural beings we believe to exist.”.",,"Sunday Scaries The psychological concept that may change how you process your emotions Meet mental life. Shutterstock Sarah Sloat 9.12.2021 2:00 PM What if you were approached outside an insurance office by a cognitive scientist offering you $5 to answer this question: “ Can a beetle feel love?” Your answer may depend on a constellation of influences. You may think of the last time you squashed a beetle and felt bad about it. Or maybe, you think of the invasive beetle that’s infested your backyard. It may be a gut reaction: Of course beetles feel love. Of course they don’t. Kara Weisman is part of a research team who asked people around the world this question, along with others like: Do ghosts get hungry? Are robots deserving of moral treatment? When these answers are pooled, Weisman looks for patterns that inform similarities, and differences in our mental lives. A mental life consists of the thoughts, feelings, and intentions we attribute to others, animals, and inanimate objects. It’s a concept we employ to sort social and moral obligations. In a study released in August in the journal Nature , Weisman and colleagues interviewed adults and children living across the United States, Ghana, Thailand, China, and the South Pacific island country of Vanuatu. The interview subjects overwhelmingly conceptualize a mind-body distinction within the framework of mental life. This is sometimes called “mind-body dualism” and it refers to thinking of cognitive abilities as different from bodily sensations. “It looks like there’s some real flexibility in the human mind.” But the research team also came across significant differences in the way people across the world categorize socio-emotional capabilities. These differences, the scientists say, may “lead different groups of people to different conclusions about human nature, about why humans do bad things and how society should react, whether to fear or embrace artificial intelligence, and how to interact with any supernatural beings we believe to exist.” The differences in cultural ideas also offer opportunities, Weisman tells me. How the discovery was made — This study was part of Stanford University’s Mind and Spirit Project , an academic collaboration that combines the disciplines of anthropology and experimental psychology. It was an effort to “think about how people understand their minds and how that affects their spiritual and religious experiences,” Weisman explains. It’s also an extension of the work Weisman was doing for her dissertation at the time. She’s interested in folk philosophy — how people process, explain, and predict the behavior of others. The study team observed a significant amount of variability when assessing how people categorize social-emotional abilities. Weisman et. al. “I was kind of steeped in these sorts of classical questions and trying to figure out ways to understand how ordinary people, non-philosophers, think about the deep things,” she says. While conducting preliminary research in the United States, Weisman realized seemingly simple, and purposefully child-like questions (“do chickens ever feel sad?”) allowed her to probe the heavy topics without having to ask intimidating questions about the relationship between the mind and body. “We can use those kinds of lightweight, easy-breezy answers to infer these deeper philosophical ideas that I’m interested in,” she says of her method. This work informed the “bottom-up approach” the team took to the study. When interviewing U.S. adults, the responses were grouped into three categories: Bodily sensations related to biological means (“get hungry,” “feel pain”) Basic emotions and social abilities (“feel sad,” “feel proud”) Perceptual-cognitive abilities (“remember things”) These are summed up as the categories heart, body, and mind. And they became launching points for evaluating responses from around the world — although the team emphasizes that “comparisons with US adults are a tool for interpretation, not an assumption of our analyses.” “This was saying OK, I’m going to throw a whole bunch of questions at people and then I’m going to look at how they’re correlated,’” Weisman says. “In other words, when people say a robot can feel happy, what else do they think robots can do? These groups of correlated questions sort of coalesced into the heart, body, and mind framework.” Insights into mental life The five field sites were chosen to capture a range of religious traditions and “a variety of cultural models of the mind.” Adults were recruited in public places, like a bus station, and asked for five minutes of their time. Children were primarily recruited through elementary schools. “I think this could be useful in managing your own emotions.” While anthropologists and cultural psychologists have long argued we don’t all understand mental life in the same way, one primary similarity emerged: this distinction between physiological sensations and cognitive abilities, or the body and mind. “In the most basic sense, what we really demonstrate here is that sometimes people attribute hunger and pain and other bodily things to a being, let’s say a chicken, without attributing anything in the way of cognition and memory to the chicken,” Weisman explains. “And sometimes people attribute cognitive abilities without attributing anything in the way of those bodily abilities.” “It’s a really strong intuition that bodies are bodies and they’re in the physical world and minds, or souls, are different in that they are kind of not totally in the physical world,” she adds. Where differences really emerged was in the matter of “heart,” or socio-emotional abilities. For example, participants in the United States, Thailand, and China recognized “heart” abilities as a third, distinct category. However, there was no clear analog for “heart” across adult participants from Ghana and Vanuatu. In Ghana, for example, emotional statements like “feel love” or “feel proud” — statements that defined “heart” for U.S. participants — were observed as more “mind-like.” Meanwhile, in Vanuatu, “feel proud” was associated with physiological sensation, and “feel happy” was associated with cognitive abilities. These variations emerge for a number of reasons, including cultural differences in the value of exposing inner feelings publicly to varying interpretations of certain emotions as positive or negative states, and speaks to “the co-evolution of social systems, moral values, and emotions across cultural settings.” How to use this information — These findings point to two especially salient points: There are aspects of the human experience that all humans access to or can relate to There are aspects of our experience and our thinking where are different, and this is why different people come to different conclusions about the same things “There’s a lot of variability in how different people understand emotions — and there’s opportunity there,” Weisman says. “It looks like there’s some real flexibility in the human mind, for how we relate to and understand our emotional lives, and how they fit into the rest of our lives.” Having multiple ways of understanding emotions suggests people also have multiple ways of understanding their world. “I think this could be useful in managing your own emotions,” she adds.”If the way you usually think about your emotions isn’t serving you, this study suggests there are other ways of thinking about your emotions, and those could perhaps serve you better.” In the abstract, these findings help pave the way toward understanding why people feel differently about human-like entities, like animals and robots. How you process emotions influences what mental life you give to others, and in turn, the value you dispense.

(Connor D. Wolf/Transport Topics) [Stay on top of transportation news: Get TTNews in your inbox .] CLEVELAND — Decisiv announced an automated encoding system for fleets using Vehicle Maintenance Reporting Standards. The announcement was made Sept. 12 at American Trucking Associations’ 2021 Technology & Maintenance Council Fall Meeting and Transportation Technology Exhibition. The VMRS Encoding for Fleets analyzes individual service operations using machine learning and artificial intelligence to interpret information captured during the creation of a repair order, and assigns appropriate VMRS codes to completed operations. “VMRS coding, while it’s extremely valuable and a lot of insights can be derived from the data when it’s coded, the reality is on the service-provider level, something like 15% of service operations that come across our platform are actually VMRS-coded,” Decisiv CEO Dick Hyatt said. “That presents challenges.” TMC develops and licenses VMRS codes to improve trucking-related repair. “So then through this kind of cleansing tool, we then now have structured data,” Hyatt said. “So then it becomes now useful and something of value. This is all about what value can we deliver, what insights can we deliver to our constituents here across the board and in particular the fleets.” RoadSigns · Roadsigns E66 (Preview) Fleet managers find that healthy, happy drivers are key to business success. Stephen Kane of Rolling Strong says driver health starts with “being vulnerable enough to listen to somebody that knows about health.” Hear a snippet above, and get the full program by going to RoadSigns.TTNews.com . Decisiv said that the encoding takes place independently after the actual repair and maintenance operation. That way, fleets using Decisiv’s Service Relationship Management solutions can save time and money by eliminating the administrative effort and cost required to manually apply VMRS codes. Fleets have the option of receiving the data on a biweekly or monthly basis in a standardized file. Decisiv said the new solution further builds upon on its partnership with TMC announced earlier this year. The partnership was formed to produce service-event benchmark reports that will track key performance indicators based on the VMRS system. VMRS encoding also is part of Decisiv’s new SRM Discovery family of analytics products and reporting services. Want more news?

The court found that a police officer may record a police response in someone’s home using a body camera. But the police cannot then use that footage for an unrelated investigation without a warrant. Get the Daily Download Our news roundup delivered every weekday. Email * “The home is not a place to which the public has access, or where an individual might expect a recording made during a lawful police visit would be preserved indefinitely, accessed without restriction, and reviewed at will for reasons unrelated to the purposes of the police visit,” wrote Justice Dalila Wendlandt on behalf of the court in a 35-page opinion. The decision came in the case Commonwealth v. Abdirahaman Yusuf. The Boston Police Department responded to a call about a domestic disturbance at Yusuf’s home, and an officer wearing a body camera filmed the home during the police response. The footage was then uploaded to a Boston police database. The Boston police’s gang unit at the time was conducting an unrelated investigation into Yusuf for firearms offenses. A detective seeking a basis to gain a search warrant for Yusuf’s home viewed the footage from the domestic disturbance call, compared that footage to another video of Yusuf holding a firearm, and identified the location where he had the firearm based on the presence of distinctive curtains. The detective obtained a search warrant, found a weapon, and arrested Yusuf on firearms charges. Because the use of body cameras is relatively new in Massachusetts, there have been few regulations or legal precedent established to govern their use. The SJC ruling addressed two issues. The first was the question of whether video taken in a home by a body camera amounts to an unlawful search of the house. In that case, the SJC ruled that it does not. As long as the officer is legally present in the home and only does what is necessary to respond to the call, having the body camera footage is no different than having a police officer see something that is in plain view. However, the court then found that the Boston police acted improperly in allowing the gang unit to review the footage for an unrelated investigation. While the initial taking of the footage was justified, Wendlandt wrote, “this subsequent review for investigatory and unrelated reasons cannot be justified as a limited extension of the officer’s plain view observations.” Wendlandt wrote that the reason for allowing body cameras is to protect the police from false allegations of damage, promote police accountability, and serve as a record of police-civilian interactions. But there are also legitimate concerns that the cameras will be used as an invasion of privacy. She said allowing a police officer to comb through footage seeking evidence of crimes unrelated to the reason an officer was called to a home is the equivalent of a “general warrant,” a long-ago British practice of letting the police rummage through a home seeking evidence of a crime, which the Constitution’s prohibition against an illegal search was meant to address. Allowing officers to review the footage to investigate an unrelated crime, she wrote, “is divorced from protecting police officers from false accusations of misconduct, ensuring police accountability, or preserving a record of police-civilian interaction.” Amid national allegations of police misconduct, the use of police body cameras has been growing both in Massachusetts and around the country. With that have come growing calls for regulation of the cameras and their footage. A bill that would have developed a statewide code for the use of body cameras was introduced in 2019. A major criminal justice reform bill that was signed into law by Gov. Charlie Baker on December 31, 2020, created a task force to study body camera regulations. But so far the Legislature has not passed any regulations.

Kade Crockford, the technology for liberty program director at the ACLU of Massachusetts, said the agency welcomes the decision that police cannot store and “trawl” around body camera footage without obtaining a warrant. “Digital technologies like body-worn cameras grant government agencies vast new powers to collect, analyze, and process information about us,” Crockford said in a statement. “When combined with limitless data storage and machine learning-driven analytical tools, the stakes are raised even higher. Today’s ruling helps ensure privacy survives in the 21st century.” SHARE Tagged in: criminal justice Related Stories ‹ Next mayor should create department of labor Boston’s preliminary race for mayor in the homestretch › Our work is made possible by The Barr Foundation John Prandato The Boston Foundation John Prandato Eastern Bank John Prandato The John S. and James L.

Learn more Home News Raspberry Pi Stops Pests from Ravaging Fruit Orchards By Ash Hill 12 September 2021 Researchers are using Raspberry Pis to automate pest control for fruit orchard farmers. Comments (0) (Image credit: University of Trento) Protecting fruit orchards from dangerous pests has been the focus as of late for researchers at the University of Trento . The team is relying on the Raspberry Pi to implement a custom machine learning (ML) platform capable of detecting dangerous pests for farmers before the infestation escalates to dangerous levels. To tackle the issue, they developed solar-powered, pheromone-based smart traps to lure bugs inside. The Raspberry Pi then captures an image for evaluation to determine whether or not too many unwanted bugs are present. In this case, the team has trained their system to detect Codling Moths with a custom model but it would be possible to train the platform to look for other bugs using another model. According to the paper published by the University of Trento research team, a Raspberry Pi 4 was considered for its notably higher processing power. However, the team ultimately chose to use an undisclosed Raspberry Pi 3 model as it operates with lower average power consumption. (Image credit: University of Trento) The smart traps are built using the Raspberry Pi, a camera module, a solar power system, a long-range radio chip and an Intel Neural Compute module to help with machine learning. A demonstration of the process identifies Codling Moths against acceptable bugs by highlighting them with a red box. This data is used to track current pest levels and can be used to trigger notifications to farmers when the population gets too high. This is one of the best Raspberry Pi projects we’ve ever seen for pest control and it’s exciting to see so many Raspberry Pis used on a large scale. To get a closer look at how the system works and what went into its creation, check out the full research paper from the University of Trento.

The codes were updated to include the Electronic Catalog and Complete Development categories. “It’s an annual subscription,” Poster said. “That’s something else that’s changed. The price is based on sales and annual revenues. So that’s another change that we’ve made. We’re doing it sort of like ATA does its membership. “It’s based on your sales and your revenue. To date, we’ve had quite a bit of interest. It’s fascinating to me, the people that are coming on board using VMRS. It’s really changed over the years.” The Electronic Catalog covers components and manufacturing, and is meant for parts manufacturers, distributors or suppliers that want to code parts or their inventory. The Complete Development was introduced for companies and entrepreneurs that are working in areas such as artificial intelligence and using VMRS to gather the data. TMC first announced that it planned to update the codes during the TMC Spring Meeting in April. Want more news?

Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Advertisement Traditional owners across Australia’s Top End are tapping into space-age technology to round up and manage the feral cattle herds which roam across their vast, remote country. Feral cattle and buffaloes churn up wetlands, destroy native habitat, erode gullies, damage rivers and, on the east of Cape York, send damaging sediment into the waters of the Great Barrier Reef. Feral buffalo wreak vast damage on nature in the top end and millions are being invested to curb their impacts. Traditional owners want to know where the herds are and where they will go next, so they can either round them up and sell, or cull them where appropriate, to protect country and cultural sites. Mimal Land Management Aboriginal Corporation, Cape York Indigenous organisation Aak Puul Ngangtam and Normanby Land management are partnering with CSIRO and Microsoft as well as Darwin and James Cook University to develop new technology. Loading In a program dubbed Space Cows, feral buffaloes and cattle will be tracked across a 22,000 square kilometre area, taking in the Arafura swamp catchment in Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory, and Upper Normanby and Archer River on Queensland’s Cape York peninsula. The aim is to create a “digital twin of the landscape” using GPS tagged animals, satellite and weather data. Combined with Microsoft’s Azure Artificial Intelligence platform. Animals aren’t just tracked across the landscape, traditional owners will be able to see where they will go depending on changes in the climate and weather. For example, they could get early warning that a herd of buffaloes will hoof it to a particular wetland when the weather is forecast to be hot and dry, enabling traditional owners to round them up or cull them before damage is done to landscape. Advertisement CSIRO research scientist Andrew Hoskins said locating feral animals in remote and inaccessible terrain is often the biggest challenge. “We’re trying to put this next generation artificial visual intelligence and predictive analytical capability in the hands of rangers to give them the ability to manage the landscape and feral animals how they want to,” Dr Hoskins said. North Australian Indigenous Land and Sea Management Alliance chief executive Ricky Archer said Indigenous peoples’ longstanding links with the northern livestock industry were shifting towards caring for country. “There is strong interest in sustainable economic opportunities across these sectors,” Mr Archer said. “There is an ongoing challenge to balance the cultural, environmental, and economic outcomes for people on country. Feral cattle are an economic resource for traditional owners, as well as a source of damage to their country and cultural sites. Credit: Seth Seden “To make informed decisions we need to have the best data. To get the best data we need to use appropriate technology. We envisage a wave of digital transformation of the Indigenous land and sea management sector, but this must be driven by Indigenous practitioners in partnership with leading organisations and agencies.” Head ranger and traditional owner at Normanby Station in Cape York, Vince Harrigan, said he is expecting new technology to complement traditional cultural management practices and create opportunities for young people to learn new skills. “The project gives us the latest technology to help with land management and tracking cattle, but also provides training with drones and tablets, which is a big thing for our mob, especially the younger ones,” Mr Harrigan said.

Close Jan Goldman Commentary: Is it moral to let computer algorithms kill Afghans? Or anyone? By Jan Goldman Sep 12, 2021 Sep 12, 2021 Jan Goldman Subscribe today for $4 for 4 months On the campus of CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, is a statue of Nathan Hale. Hale was executed by the British during the Revolutionary War and is memorialized as the first American spy to die for this country. Below his statue are the immortal words, “I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country.” In July, one of his descendants, Daniel Hale, was sentenced to almost four years in prison for spying against the United States. Hale, a defense contractor, said he was compelled to leak classified information to “dispel the lie that drone warfare keeps us safe, that our lives are worth more than theirs (the enemy).” Specifically, Hale was morally repulsed by drone warfare and the unaccountable nature of using technology to kill without regret. He may be right, up to a point. Some members of Congress have called on President Joe Biden to grant Hale a pardon. He pleaded guilty to violating the Espionage Act for leaking classified documents to the media. Hale said he felt compelled to speak out after realizing he had helped kill Afghan civilians, including a small child. One document he leaked showed that during a five-month operation in Afghanistan nearly 90% of the people killed were not the intended targets. Over the years, the intersection of technology and man’s ability to kill has been playing out, with little or no debate on the morality of such action. We mustn’t become people who seek retribution at all costs, regardless of obtaining our objectives. It was not until World War II that we could create massive deaths, and the United States remains the only country to use nuclear warfare against an enemy. President Harry Truman detonated two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan, killing an estimated 300,000 people in the explosions. Truman said he never lost any sleep over the bombings because he believed it shortened the war and reduced the number of further killings. More recently, from a drone operations center made chiefly of plywood in the middle of the Helmand desert in southern Afghanistan, some of the world’s most sophisticated technology was aimed against Taliban fighters armed primarily with rifles. According to one U.S. drone operator, he directed more than 250 airstrikes resulting in 304 Taliban members killed and 54 wounded in nine months. What comes with technologically induced massive strikes are unintended consequences — the “collateral damage” when civilians become victims of a planned military strike. Slowly we are moving into an era where intelligence is not about substance, but rather a sense turned into algorithms digestible by computers. Recently in Libya, dozens of small drones, similar to those used by hobbyists, began divebombing trucks and soldiers, exploding on contact, causing panic and confusion. Strongman Khalifa Hifter’s soldiers retreated from Turkish-backed forces of the United Nations-recognized Libyan government. The drones were operated without human control as they hunted down Hifter’s fleeing soldiers.

Today, efforts to enact a total ban on lethal autonomous weapons, long demanded by human rights activists, are supported by 30 countries. But the world’s leading military powers insist that isn’t necessary. The United States and Russia say concerns are overblown, and humans can effectively control autonomous weapons, and accurate artificial intelligence weapon systems are still far into the future. Meanwhile, the United States, China and Russia are meeting to discuss a treaty limiting autonomous weapons, as all three countries race to develop them. However, European lawmakers recently proposed strict new rules regulating the use of algorithms for surveillance since studies have shown facial recognition for these programs is better at identifying white faces than non-white ones. For Daniel Hale, the intrusion and expansion of technology in warfare were too much to tolerate, and he decided to expose them to the media. And this is where he made a mistake. As a government employee with a security clearance, he was entrusted with the nation’s secrets. He had a legal and moral obligation to keep that trust, and he was wrong to leak the documents to the media. We tend to view this as a legal issue, not a moral issue. But the moral perspective is important. Informed citizens need to be able to discuss the implications and unintended consequences of artificial intelligence and technology with the ability to kill from afar, yet there is little public discussion over these weapons as they move into the mainstream. These are not theoretical concepts, given that we are likely to be militarily engaged in Afghanistan without troops on the ground, as we pull them from harm’s way.

Commercial Radio Australia (CRA) says the new multimillion dollar hybrid measurement system comes in response to the rapid digitisation of audio consumption in Australia. Radio360 will begin to adopt the use of e-diaries for most of its surveys. It will also integrate livestreaming data to provide more information on the size and profile of audiences listening across digital platforms. A panel of 2,000 consumers will also be asked to wear an electronic watch meter that will detect when the wearer is in listening range of a radio broadcast and will provide encrypted anonymised information, to be used to validate and ensure the streaming data is accurate and deduplicated. CRA will partner with global research firm GfK to roll out the new system in measured stages, commencing in late 2021 and accelerating through 2022. “After consultation with key industry stakeholders, in recognition of the changing behaviour of our growing digital audiences and the need to accurately capture and report on this increasing consumption, the industry has moved forward with GfK in developing a hybrid measurement system,” says CRA chair and Southern Cross Austereo CEO Grant Blackley. “Australians are increasingly consuming radio through digital platforms. More than 2.7 million people are listening to radio each week through their smartphones. The industry’s investment in a hybrid measurement system will allow advertisers to connect to known, targeted audiences at scale.” The system will begin integrating streaming audiences in early 2022 using wearable device technology. Panels of 400 consumers in each of the five metro markets will be asked to wear watch meters to calibrate, validate and ensure de-duplicated streaming data. Streaming data will then be integrated with broadcast audience data, accredited via Gold Standard radio analysis software, and made available as part of regular ratings reports. The move is part of an ongoing review and modernisation of radio ratings being undertaken by CRA in partnership with GfK. “GfK is excited to partner with CRA to make hybrid radio audience measurement a reality following a rigorous and thorough testing and development period,” says GfK managing director for Australia and New Zealand Dr Morten Boyer. “Australia is one of the strongest radio markets in the world and the first to embrace this exciting approach, both from a methodological and data science perspective.” As part of the process, the transition away from paper diaries to e-diaries will continue this year. The proportion of survey respondents using an e-diary will be steadily increased from Survey 6, 2021, making the system more resilient to disruptions such as COVID, while maintaining the annual sample size at 60,000. “The overhaul of the radio ratings will future-proof the system and better capture listening everywhere, on every device,” says CRA CEO Joan Warner. “Digitisation and innovation adopted across the radio sector have removed any limitations to listening – radio is now genuinely ubiquitous, and we need a measurement system capable of capturing that. “By putting the right technology and methodology in place, we are ensuring that we are able to do justice to the full scale and opportunity of our audience in the eyes of advertisers, now and into the future.” Have something to say on this?

(“BioXcel” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: BTAI), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company utilizing artificial intelligence approaches to develop transformative medicines in neuroscience and immuno-oncology, today announced that updates from its ongoing Phase 1b/2 trial of BXCL701, the Company's investigational, oral innate immunity activator, in aggressive forms of prostate cancer will be presented in a poster session at the 2021 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress, which will take place virtually from September 16-21, 2021. POSTER PRESENTATION DETAILS Title: BXCL701 — 1 st -in-class oral activator of systemic innate immunity — combined with pembrolizumab, in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC): Phase 2 results Poster Session: Genitourinary Tumors, Prostate Time: Available starting on September 15 at 6:05 PM EST Poster Number: 610P The abstracts are currently available on the ESMO website at www.esmo.org . At the start of the poster sessions, the poster will be available in the “News & Media” section of the Company’s website at www.bioxceltherapeutics.com . About BXCL701 BXCL701 is an investigational orally administered innate immune activator designed to initiate inflammation in the tumor microenvironment. Approved and experimental immunotherapies often struggle to address cancers that appear “cold” or uninflamed. Therefore, BXCL701 may render “cold” tumors “hot,” making them more detectable by the adaptive immune system and thereby facilitating the development of a strong anti-cancer immune response. BioXcel’s preclinical data supports BXCL701’s synergy with both current checkpoint inhibitor-based therapies and emerging immunotherapies directed to activate T-cells, such as IL-2. BXCL701 is currently being developed as therapy for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer of adenocarcinoma and treatment emergent Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer (tNEPC) phenotypes (both “cold” tumors) and other advanced solid cancers that are “hot” or have become resistant to checkpoint inhibitors. Story continues About BioXcel Therapeutics, Inc. BioXcel Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company utilizing artificial intelligence approaches to develop transformative medicines in neuroscience and immuno-oncology. BioXcel’s drug re-innovation approach leverages existing approved drugs and/or clinically validated product candidates together with big data and proprietary machine learning algorithms to identify new therapeutic indices. BioXcel’s two most advanced clinical development programs are BXCL501, an investigational, proprietary, orally dissolving thin film formulation of dexmedetomidine for the treatment of agitation associated with psychiatric and neurological disorders, and BXCL701, an investigational, orally administered, systemic innate immunity activator in development for the treatment of aggressive forms of prostate cancer and advanced solid tumors that are refractory or treatment naïve to checkpoint inhibitors.

Just because you can, does not mean you should: a warning that Conservative ministers would do well to heed as they look to sever European Union rules in the wake of Brexit. Government plans to scrap an EU rule guaranteeing human checks on decisions made by computer algorithms would not only remove a vital safeguard against inbuilt machine bias; it also risks adding, rather than cutting, burdens on business. The government wants to create a “data dividend” to boost innovation, with artificial intelligence among the sectors to be nurtured. It is understandable that the government feels pressure to show Brexit’s benefits — and there are areas where the UK could jettison Brussels rules in its favour — but cutting key protections of the EU’s general data protection regulation, as mooted in a consultation unveiled on Friday , is not the right way forward. GDPR’s Article 22 guarantees a human review of algorithms’ decisions, in areas as sensitive as loan provision or recruitment. Abandoning it would be foolhardy. Coming after lamentable — and now shelved — plans to harvest patient information from GP surgeries, the proposals are another assault on individuals’ data rights by a government emboldened by the pandemic’s necessary trade-offs around information sharing. It would also make the UK an outlier when even countries such as China — and indeed technology companies themselves — are moving towards greater human oversight of algorithmic decision-making. The UK is also looking at scrapping cookie warnings; pop-ups that inform internet users they are being tracked by advertisers. Cookie notices may be annoying but they are not, as the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, claimed, “pointless” , as they allow users to decline tracking. Far neater is the suggestion by Elizabeth Denham, the information commissioner, that users set preferences once on their browser. That, however, would require global co-operation. In all, the proposals risk creating more, not less, hassle: if rules on personal data diverge too wildly from the EU’s, the bloc could revoke a February agreement to allow continued information flows across the Channel, which would be disastrous for businesses. In any case, for UK companies doing any kind of business in the EU, having a separate domestic regime to comply with seems onerous, not innovative.

Similar issues are playing out in financial services, where a lack of an access agreement means that politicians, regulators and the City of London are divided as to how far the UK should diverge from EU rules. So far, tinkering is at the edges, focusing on insurance rules called Solvency II. A bloc-wide insurance regime was always too blunt for the idiosyncrasies of domestic markets but even the EU is reviewing it. Part of the rules, known as the risk margin, which insurers complain makes them hold too much capital when interest-rates are low, look like they will be recalibrated but the Bank of England is wary of letting insurers free up a big chunk of capital. Both industry and regulators agree on scrapping the EU banker bonus cap . Bankers obviously hate it and UK watchdogs are dubious because they feel it drives up fixed pay and removes discretion to withhold most remuneration in the event of wrongdoing. But conversely, this is one area the government will not touch. Arguing for abandoning limits on banker bonuses would be politically toxic, particularly in “blue wall” constituencies. It seems with bonuses, ministers seem content to do nothing, even though they could do something: an EU rule worth jettisoning that even Brexit cannot banish.

AlphaGo is one such RL-based computer program that has defeated a professional human Go player, a breakthrough that experts feel was a decade ahead of its time. Reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning because it does not need the labelled input/output pairings for training or the explicit correction of sub-optimal actions. Instead, it investigates how intelligent agents should behave in a particular situation to maximize the concept of cumulative reward. This is a huge plus when working with real-world applications that don’t come with a tonne of highly curated observations. Furthermore, when confronted with a new circumstance, RL agents can acquire methods that allow them to behave even in an unclear and changing environment, relying on their best estimates at the proper action. Despite this advantage, many believe that it is inefficient because it is based on a trial-and-error process. However, researchers at Intel’s AI Lab has developed effective approaches for using RL for practical breakthroughs. They’re working on RL agents that can swiftly figure out challenging jobs and work in groups, placing the group’s general aim ahead of their own personal objectives. In RL, the tension between exploiting a current policy and exploring alternatives is crucial. RL agents have no way of knowing whether it is optimal at any particular time. As a result, it must choose between continuing to choose actions based on its present policy and deviating from it to explore new alternatives. It will never improve if it selects the former. The exploration rate is frequently set high at the start of training and gradually reduced as the agent gets expertise. Agents in Low-Reward Situations When an agent is functioning in a low-reward situation, the challenges become considerably larger. In this circumstance, the environment only offers a feedback signal, perhaps only at the end of a protracted multi-step process. As a result, the majority of the agent’s actions result in no useful feedback. Many researchers have used the Mujoco Humanoid benchmark created by OpenAI to assess RL bots’ performance in such difficult conditions. Researchers must teach a computer model of a 3D humanoid figure to walk for a set amount of time without falling in this experiment. While walking appears to be a simple activity, it is pretty difficult for an RL system to master. Intel’s AI team proposed a novel solution called CERL: Collaborative Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning to solve this problem. They break down this task into two components: small problems for which the system can receive rapid feedback and larger optimization problems that must be handled over a longer period. For the Mujoco Humanoid challenge, they had many learners working on smaller problems, including not falling over, raising a foot, among others. As they attempted to meet these tiny targets, the learners received rapid feedback. Each learner thus became an expert in their particular skill area, talents that may help them achieve the bigger goal of prolonged walking, even if they had no chance of achieving it on their own. What is unique about their design is that it allows all learners to contribute to and draw from a single buffer at the same time. Each learner had access to everyone else’s experiences, which aided its own exploration and made it significantly more efficient at its own task. The second group of agents, dubbed actors, was tasked with combining all of the little movements in order to achieve the broader goal of prolonged walking. Since these agents were rarely close enough to register a reward, the team used a genetic algorithm, a technique that simulates biological evolution through natural selection. Genetic algorithms start with possible solutions to a problem and utilize a fitness function to develop the best answer over time. They created a set of actors for each “generation,” each with a unique method for completing the walking job. They then graded them according to their performance, keeping the best and discarding the others. The following generation of actors was the survivors’ “offspring,” inheriting their policies. Their hybrid system quickly found an optimal policy that allowed the Mujoco Humanoid to go for a walk, outperforming other algorithms at the time. The Multi-Agent Problem While RL is difficult enough due to the scarcity of rewards, it becomes significantly more complicated when a job requires numerous agents to work together to attain a common goal. They chose the benchmark for simulated Mars rovers, in which two rovers must work together to identify many objects in the lowest amount of time. To tackle this difficult multi-agent task, the researchers extended their CERL framework and introduced Multiagent Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (MERL) . They used evolutionary search again this time. They made multiple duplicates of a whole rover team this time while working with teams. All of the Rover 1s and all of the Rover 2s and so on shared a single replay buffer. The replay buffers were purposefully split by rovers to allow each to focus on its own local learning. https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/artificial-intelligence/posts/introducing-merl.html The rovers were required to work together because each target was only counted once enough rovers had reached it. Locally optimized policies were inserted into the evolutionary search, just as they were in CERL, so that the best policies from the Rover 1s, Rover 2s, and so on could be tried out. Evolution simply had to cope with the overall strategy of the team. The team compared MERL’s performance to that of the MADDPG algorithm, another state-of-the-art system for multi-agent RL. They notice that their virtual robots were first tested on a smaller rover issue, in which only one rover must reach a target. It is found that MERL hit more targets than MADDPG, as well as some unusual team behaviour. MADDPG entirely failed when three rovers had to reach a goal at the same time, and MERL’s emergent team formation was even more visible, a tendency they noticed as the needed number of rovers increased. Intel’s research explored various multi-agent benchmarks, and the two-part optimization of MERL significantly beat existing state-of-the-art techniques in each case. The team is also looking into how communication might assist multi-agent systems in performing better. They’re specifically looking into whether agents on a team communicating with one another can form a kind of language. They’re also exploring ways to provide a common safety standard for diverse RL algorithms, as well as a framework for training RL agents to operate securely in any application. Because an abstracted concept of safety is difficult to establish, and a task-specific definition of safety is difficult to scale across activities, this is easier said than done. Today’s AI is good at things like object and speech recognition, but it’s not good at performing actions. Robots, self-driving automobiles, and other autonomous systems will benefit from RL training since it will teach them how to operate in a changing and unpredictable environment. They’re employing RL paired with search algorithms to teach robots how to construct successful trajectories with minimum interaction with the real world in one ongoing test of our theories. This method could allow robots to experiment with new actions without risking harming themselves. Finally, they are using the same methodology to improve many areas of software and hardware systems. Their recent study shows that an RL agent can learn how to manage memory on a hardware accelerator efficiently. By efficiently allocating chunks of data to various memory components, their technique, Evolutionary Graph RL, was able to virtually quadruple the speed of execution on hardware as compared to the native compiler. This achievement and other recent study findings demonstrate that RL is progressing from solving games to solving real-world problems.

In ordinary times, consumers prefer holding on to old habits, with a very slow adoption of new methods that require them to change the way they have been traditionally thinking or interacting. It especially holds true for the financial services sector, mostly life insurance, which has typically been a traditional product. However, the pandemic caused customers to change their behaviour – rapidly and in large numbers. Customers were forced to adopt newer ways of doing everyday activities, from grocery shopping to office work to online education for kids and even financial transactions, offering new experiences. Long-held beliefs When individuals are delighted by new ways, even long-held beliefs can change, making them more willing to repeat the behaviour, even when the trigger (in this case, the pandemic) is gradually easing out. The life insurance industry, too, experienced the same change and took some of its biggest leaps, in terms of digital, customer service and underwriting in the last one-and-a-half years. The next new normal will be all about focussing on these changing customer behaviours. The ‘everything digital’ customer Today, almost all age groups have begun to adopt a millennial mindset when it comes to digital. Speed and ease of transaction will be seen as key differentiator in the days ahead. There will be a need to enhance use of data and accelerate digitisation for heightened customer experience. Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, along with intelligent automation, will be the key source of better customer insights and, thereby, faster turnaround. This customer behaviour will force companies to transition out of legacy platforms and collaborate with ecosystem players to speed up their game, leading to enhanced customer experience and understanding. The ‘I need more’ customer The world witnessed a massive shift in the purchasing behaviour of customers – personalisation of every aspect of the customer experience. One-size-fits-all products will not appease customers in the next new normal. The customer will need adequate life insurance and would like to be covered for specific risks. Hyper-personalisation will take a leapfrog, and companies will have to focus on simple, innovative, and differentiated products to cater to policyholders’ emerging needs. This will lead to innovations in the space of protection and health-related covers. These solutions will be simple to understand, will have hybrid features or bundled offerings, and will be available across channels. Simplifying products and the insurance ecosystem so that the customer experience becomes less complex, more efficient, and more tailored, will lead to insurance offerings becoming bespoke, simpler and cheaper. The ‘experience-focussed customer Tomorrow’s customer will value life insurance providers who understand his/her needs well and keep customer engagement at the centrestage. Like other e-commerce platforms, the insurer should be able to predict customer needs in advance and advise them through proactive engagement, with a 360-degree view of the customer. Personalisation in terms of tailored solutions, service and even in language, will be a key differentiator, especially in a country like India. Quick response time, faster resolutions, and robust self-service capabilitieswill be the ask of the customer in the next new normal. Life insurers will have to strengthen their use of the decision engine or next-best-action technology to have relevant insights about their customers, carry out need-analysis and, thereby, suggest appropriate products in line with an individual’s needs and behaviour. The ‘omnipresent’ customer Customers today have become used to having access anytime, anywhere. They expect services to be available on their fingertips, wherever they are. Customer preference for easy process and digital channels will continue to be on the rise. There will be a critical need to expand service channels, providing more options to engage – physical branches, phone-based contact centres, chatbots, WhatsApp, Mobile Apps and social media. Phygital will be the way to go as this will also take care of the customers in Indian hinterlands who are still looking for physical access. This omni-channel, unified, and asynchronous messaging will help insurers engage with customers on their desired channel and at their preferred time. The ‘health-conscious’ customer Anything propagating health and wellness will enhance customer affinity in the future. The pandemic has resulted in an increase in proactive consciousness towards health, and customers will value companies that understand this evolving need. The future will see life insurers evolving as holistic protection partners. Life and health insurance companies will need to ride on each other’s expertise and work on combo solutions, which can be a one-stop-shop for the insurance needs of a customer. The proliferation of data and connected devices, particularly wearables, will continue to make it easier for life insurance companies to play an active role in shaping customer’s health – to everyone’s benefit. The industry might see several tie-ups with wellness partners to look at the complete wellbeing of their customers and, thereby, also reduce risks. A definite win-win for both customers and insurers. The experience of living through the pandemic has changed the way people live and behave. Changes which offered positive experiences will last longer, especially the ones driven by well-being, convenience, and simplicity. Thereby, digital adoption, value-based personalised purchasing, and increased health awareness will be the customer behaviours that will shape the next new normal. This will be a game-changer for the life insurance industry and provide an opportunity for the industry to think beyond the usual, innovate, and offer granular, value-based and integrated products to meet customer needs. The focus will be on insurance offerings, which will combine risk transfer with proactive and value-added services and emerge as a differentiator. It will be critical for insurers to stay relevant and adapt with the changing times. As the world begins its slow pivot from managing the Covid crisis to recovery, it’s clear that some of these shifts in behaviour will define the next new normal. It will change the way consumers behave, in some cases for years to come.

(Connor D. Wolf/Transport Topics) [Stay on top of transportation news: Get TTNews in your inbox .] CLEVELAND — Decisiv announced an automated encoding system for fleets using Vehicle Maintenance Reporting Standards. The announcement was made Sept. 12 at American Trucking Associations’ 2021 Technology & Maintenance Council Fall Meeting and Transportation Technology Exhibition. The VMRS Encoding for Fleets analyzes individual service operations using machine learning and artificial intelligence to interpret information captured during the creation of a repair order, and assigns appropriate VMRS codes to completed operations. “VMRS coding, while it’s extremely valuable and a lot of insights can be derived from the data when it’s coded, the reality is on the service-provider level, something like 15% of service operations that come across our platform are actually VMRS-coded,” Decisiv CEO Dick Hyatt said. “That presents challenges.” TMC develops and licenses VMRS codes to improve trucking-related repair. “So then through this kind of cleansing tool, we then now have structured data,” Hyatt said. “So then it becomes now useful and something of value. This is all about what value can we deliver, what insights can we deliver to our constituents here across the board and in particular the fleets.” RoadSigns · Roadsigns E66 (Preview) Fleet managers find that healthy, happy drivers are key to business success. Stephen Kane of Rolling Strong says driver health starts with “being vulnerable enough to listen to somebody that knows about health.” Hear a snippet above, and get the full program by going to RoadSigns.TTNews.com . Decisiv said that the encoding takes place independently after the actual repair and maintenance operation. That way, fleets using Decisiv’s Service Relationship Management solutions can save time and money by eliminating the administrative effort and cost required to manually apply VMRS codes. Fleets have the option of receiving the data on a biweekly or monthly basis in a standardized file. Decisiv said the new solution further builds upon on its partnership with TMC announced earlier this year.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Cybersecurity 2021 Home AI By Sarah Hunt September 12, 2021 Organizations across industries are turning to artificial intelligence (AI) in cybersecurity to protect their networks and relieve often understaffed IT and security operations centers (SOCs). AI cybersecurity can provide network security from various angles, including: Application security Cloud security Endpoint security Overall network security Network traffic analysis (NTA) As a component of security incident and event management (SIEM) platforms This review of the AI in cybersecurity provides information about the state of the market, key growth drivers, the primary industries utilizing it, regional impacts, leading AI cybersecurity vendors, and typical use cases. AI in cybersecurity today Markets and Markets estimates the AI cybersecurity market will reach $38.2 billion by 2026, up from $8.8 billion in 2019 — a CAGR of 23.3%. Typical software offerings in the AI cybersecurity market include various features and options related to AI-based network monitoring, including application program interfaces (API) for language, speech, vision, and sensor data and machine learning (ML) algorithms. Key growth drivers Notable growth drivers in the AI cybersecurity market include the widespread increase in the adoption of Internet of Things (IoT), growth in the number of connected devices and increased awareness about the vulnerabilities inherent to Wi-Fi networks. As more organizations venture into the cloud computing realm, AI cybersecurity that functions within these environments will begin to take over more of the AI cybersecurity market share. Market and Markets also points to increased social media use for business functions as a prominent growth driver in this field. Primary industries AI cybersecurity usage is widespread, but a few prominent industries using this technology include: IT services Banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) Health care Telecommunications Manufacturing and supply chain Adoption by region North America currently holds the largest share of the AI cybersecurity market, according to Verified Market Research . Within North America, the U.S. market makes up the largest share, due to its significant presence in various fields, including: Banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) Government agencies Cloud computing Data regulatory compliance services While North America is anticipated to retain its majority share of the AI cybersecurity market, it’s important to note that the Asia Pacific (APAC) region is expected to become the fastest-growing region between 2019 and 2026. This is due to increasing internet adoption, a shift toward digitization of internal processes, and this region’s growing adoption of cloud-based services. Each of these areas can benefit from AI-enhanced cybersecurity solutions. Benefits of AI cybersecurity Organizations have myriad cybersecurity solution options, including AI-enhanced solutions that offer attractive benefits unavailable in traditional cybersecurity. For example: AI can gain knowledge over time. Platforms enhanced by machine learning and deep learning can adapt to the networks where they “live” by recognizing patterns. Once these platforms establish a baseline of expected network behavior, they can intelligently determine whether unexpected behavior poses a threat. AI is less error-prone and more efficient than human analysts. While humans will always be part of the cybersecurity equation, many processes related to network security can be automated and handled by AI, reducing input errors, speeding up security-related processes, and increasing the SOC’s ability to detect unknown threats. AI can monitor a more extensive scope than human security analysts. Even large SOCs are limited in their ability to examine every potential vulnerability, especially when there are dozens or hundreds of endpoints at play. Modern enterprises with mobile-connected workforces and IoT significantly benefit from turning over some of that oversight to AI. Another critical benefit has to do with the so-called AI arms race. Effectively, the theory goes, bad actors are already harnessing the power of AI to conduct network attacks — without equally powerful AI cybersecurity solutions, enterprises are highly vulnerable to sophisticated hacks, phishing, and other attacks. In its report, “Using AI for Evil: A Guide to How Cybercriminals Will Weaponize and Exploit AI to Attack Your Business,” the Forrester Research team writes, “There are already instances of threat actors and hackers using AI technologies to bolster their attacks and malware.” Enterprises face a never-ending race to beat them to the punch. AI cybersecurity use cases Apart from the typical use cases for any network security approach — safeguarding proprietary data and enterprise assets — cybersecurity that includes an AI component is especially well-suited for specific use cases, including: Fraud detection Unified threat management Within mobile device management (MDM) approaches, especially those that include BYOD mobile devices Streamlining security operations, including reducing the amount of repetitive and tedious work required of analysts AI cybersecurity vendors These 10 companies represent the majority of the AI cybersecurity market share.

(NASDAQ: ECHO) increased 52.3% in the previous trading session. This is why it happened. The stock price of Echo Global Logistics, Inc. (NASDAQ: ECHO) – a leading provider of technology-enabled transportation and supply chain management services – increased 52.3% in the previous trading session, going from a previous close of $31.32 to $47.70. Investors are responding to the company Echo Global Logistics announcing that it has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by funds managed by global private equity firm The Jordan Company, L.P. (TJC) for an equity value of approximately $1.3 billion. Through this deal, Echo will become a private company which it expects will provide additional resources and flexibility to continue to build its technology and data science platform and enhance its value proposition to shippers and carriers. Under the terms of the deal, Echo stockholders will receive $48.25 per share in cash — which represents a premium of approximately 54% over Echo’s closing share price on September 9, 2021, and a premium of approximately 32% over Echo’s all-time high closing share price on September 10, 2018. Going forward, Echo believes that the transaction provides its stockholders with an attractive premium that delivers immediate compelling value for their shares. And the definitive agreement was unanimously approved by Echo’s Board of Directors, which recommended that Echo’s stockholders approve the agreement. The deal is subject to customary closing conditions, including stockholder approval and the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period. And the transaction is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2021. The closing is not subject to a financing condition. KEY QUOTES: “I’m thrilled to partner with TJC as they bring significant expertise and industry experience to enable Echo to further accelerate our success in the market. In addition, having an experienced financial partner, with resources to fund continued growth, will result in a more rapid expansion of Echo’s supply chain capabilities, including all of the automation planned to enable both our people and our digital freight marketplace.” — Doug Waggoner, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer at Echo “We are impressed with Echo’s people, technology, and business results, since their founding in 2005, and are excited that Echo’s leadership selected TJC as their partner in this recapitalization. We strongly support the team’s vision for continued growth and look forward to partnering with them as we bring expanded financial resources and expertise to accelerate Echo’s technology leadership that has set the company apart from its competitors.” — Brian Higgins, head of TJC’s logistics and supply chain vertical Disclaimer: This content is intended for informational purposes.

Send me a copy: https://mybs.in/2ZhROg3 (Book Cover) SYSTEM ERROR: Where Big Tech Went Wrong and How We Can Reboot ALSO READ Harvey Weinstein appeals rape conviction, blames 'cavalier' judge Finding opportunity How Big Tech is watching you Tuning into pain: How Begum Akhtar channeled her struggles into art Distilled wisdom from investment legends SYSTEM ERROR: Where Big Tech Went Wrong and How We Can Reboot Authors : Rob Reich, Mehran Sahami and Jeremy M. Weinstein Publisher : Harper/HarperCollins Price : $27.99 Pages : 319 Stop me if you’ve heard this one: A philosopher, a computer engineer and a government guy walk into a bar — and give us a very detailed and overwhelming college lecture about what we need to do about tech, its power and the damaging unintended (and, often, quite intended) consequences of its inventions. It’s a noble effort, but about halfway through this book by three Stanford professors, I felt as if maybe I were the one who needed a stiff drink, given the ceaseless onslaught of studies, factoids and examples of a far too broad swath of the problems that face our country and the world because of the growing hegemony of tech companies and their products. Don’t get me wrong, it’s critical that we make more connections between tech and the rest of our world, especially as it invades everything from politics to entertainment to communications to travel to, yes, how we fall in love. And it’s important to recognise how we’ve become twisted and angry and hopelessly addicted, due in part to the flood of malevolent information that flows over devices and gadgets that we cannot now live without. That was the impetus of the authors — Rob Reich, Mehran Sahami and Jeremy M. Weinstein — when they joined together at Stanford to create a multidisciplinary undergraduate course called “Ethics, Public Policy and Technological Change.” Its aim, as described by the school, is to “explore the ethical and social impact of technological innovation, marrying the humanities, social science and computer science” and from there “to bring about a fundamental shift in how students, whatever their choice of major and whatever their professional career pathway, think about their role as enablers and shapers of technological change in society.” Well, sign me up — except that in book form and not over a full semester, it becomes a laundry list of very weighty issues, each of which should be (and has been) the subject of its own book. These include, among other things: artificial intelligence, algorithms, facial recognition, self-driving cars, privacy, hate speech and the obvious corruption built into the venture system of capitalisation. Even Soylent, the drink invented to minimise the need to prepare food, makes an appearance. If that sounds like reading an action-packed syllabus, it is exactly like that, minus getting to hang on the lovely Palo Alto campus. Jamming all these topics into one book gives it a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it quality about the material, although for those not familiar, System Error certainly serves as a very well-written, if superficial, primer for all we need to know about the impact of the tech industry. Then again, maybe the authors should be applauded for their impulse to write the book at all, to the extent that it challenges readers to think beyond a one-note computer education that’s driven by efficiency and optimisation, without ethical rigor. Big Tech celebrates ad nauseam the ability to grow fast and scale endlessly rather than asking whether and how we should make some product in the first place. Understanding consequences and taking responsibility for their innovation is scarce in the industry, and that is exactly how the problem mutates to where we are. The authors — who are the ones teaching these wunderkinds — do understand that there needs to be some self-reflection, finding a medium somewhere between tech boosterism and the techlash. But in playing out the challenges, they provide only one short chapter about solutions, again like a checklist and far too light to let readers feel as if they can do much about the Silicon Valley freight train headed their way. When complex tech phrases like “blitzscaling,” “privacy paradox,” “OKRs” and “success disaster” whiz by, it’s hard to imagine doing anything about it but firing up the iPhone and doomscrolling Twitter. In other words, I’ll take that Soylentini now. ©2021TheNewYorkTimesNewsService Dear Reader, Business Standard has always strived hard to provide up-to-date information and commentary on developments that are of interest to you and have wider political and economic implications for the country and the world.

Premier Construction Premier Hospitality Rail Construction Premier Retail PC Channel Islands Premier Engineering Premier Construction Premier Hospitality Rail Construction Premier Retail PC Channel Islands Premier Engineering Industry News • Premier Rail Cordel & D/Gauge partnership delivers breakthrough automated intelligent gauging to UK railways 1 day ago by Amy Written by Amy The intelligent gauging solution is being showcased this week at Railtex Automated intelligent gauging has become a reality for railways in the UK with the launch of a partnership between leading AI and gauging providers Cordel and D/Gauge. Automated intelligent gauging combines the collection, categorisation, and interpretation of transport corridor data with the management, analysis and application of gauging data sets so that railways receive the most complete gauging information for all projects, plans and routes in their network. Cordel is a leader in the use of LiDAR and AI to collect and understand railway corridor data. Cordel’s railway-specialised machine learning engines provide the fastest and most accurate interpretation of gauging-relevant data points across a railway. Cordel is used by major railways in Japan, Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom. D/Gauge specialises in innovative, powerful, and accurate gauging algorithms, applicable to any gauging challenge, created from decades of research and data science. D/Gauge is relied upon by major railways across the UK. After collaborating on a successful project for Network Rail where Cordel’s technology and D/Gauge’s expertise came together, both companies are excited to be presenting a joint stand at this year’s Railtex / Infrarail event, 7-9 September in Birmingham, UK. Many railways are deploying LiDAR and cameras to collect terabytes of point cloud and imagery data, but they struggle to use this data to its full potential due to sheer volume, so a smarter way of interrogating point cloud data is needed. Cordel’s AI intelligently interprets railway point cloud data, normalising linear & GPS references and understanding the entire context of the corridor-wide detail to deliver accurately classified data for clearance and gauging purposes. D/Gauge’s fully cloud-based solution for gauging software ingests the classified data and delivers automatic gauging analysis and reporting, including dynamic clearances and high-wide projects, providing increased accessibility and gauging awareness across the network. This enables more revenue traffic, more efficient operations, and safer railways. Colin Johnson, Managing Director of D/Gauge said “We’re very pleased to be working with a forward-thinking company like Cordel. Our values are extremely similar, and this working relationship will allow us to increase our offering to more clients. With our gauging expertise and Cordel’s exceptional data automation, we can unlock more of our network, together.” Cordel CEO and Co-founder Nick Smith commented “We’re thrilled to be working with the team at D/Gauge. Colin and his team are experts in understanding survey data and using software to display accurate clearance distances.” Rebeka Sellick, Business Development Director at Cordel, commented “Innovative railways face data sharing and processing challenges. We can automate the critical data pipelines from train-borne sensor data collection, through AI processing to insights at the decision-maker’s desktop or handheld. Cordel has been hugely successful in other markets, and we’re excited to be enabling railways in the UK and Europe to benefit. Working with the specialists at D/Gauge provides an end-to-end automated and intelligent gauging solution that addresses the unique complexities of gauging across the UK rail networks.” Visit Cordel and D/Gauge at the Cordel stand G51 where Nick, Colin and their teams will be on hand to discuss the exciting innovations in AI and gauging software, including new features and upcoming releases.

It has served more than 400 clients till date (L-R) Qandle co-founder & CTO Himanshu Aggarwal with co-founder and CEO Chayan Mukhopadhyay Founded by Chayan Mukhopadhyay and Himanshu Aggarwal, Qandle distinguishes itself as a comprehensive solution and covers the entire gamut of HR activities—from hire to retire. It has leveraged technology to develop a modular and flexible solution for HRs looking to deliver the next-generation experience to the teams. The idea was first conceived by Mukhopadhyay. In his previous organisations, he had experienced the challenges of clunky HR solutions and how they are an irritant for the HR department and employees both. So when Mukhopadhyay decided to enter into the world of entrepreneurship, he started a company in the employee benefits space. However, when he interacted with HRs of different organisations while pitching the solution, he witnessed a grave need of HR management solution that is comprehensive, configurable and intuitive.

And then they started Qandle: an all-in-one HR platform—in 2016. The platform follows a SaaS based model and charges a subscription fee per employee per month. It offers an extensive array of modules supporting day-to-day HRMS functioning with refined execution on the backbone of AI, machine learning and predictive analytics. All the sweat and effort is proving fruitful for the brand. The startup raised $1,200,000 from investors—Arun Chandramohan and Redwood Internet Ventures in 2018. The startup has a strong portfolio of 400+ clients, with a major presence in NCR, Bangalore and Kolkata. The brand has names like Spinny, Airmeet, Chanel, Shadowfax, Camp K 12, Quality Control of India, Edureka, Shriram schools, TCNS Clothing, Vidyamandir Classes as its clients. Qandle has raised a total of $1,200,000 in 2018 in its first and only funding round. It is cash neutral for more than a year now, and continues to grow organically, adding 15-20 new corporations per month. Going forward, Mukhopadhyay says, “The short term goal is to double the client base by 2022. In addition, we are striving to continuously improve our product offering by introducing new innovations and modules to help the evolving landscape of work.” Get live Stock Prices from BSE , NSE , US Market and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds , Check out latest IPO News , Best Performing IPOs , calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator , know market’s Top Gainers , Top Losers & Best Equity Funds .

File No prior information given on enhancement, say students Engineering fee in university colleges has been doubled this year from ₹ 18,000 to ₹ 35,000 for the traditional B.Tech courses and from ₹ 35,000 to ₹ 70,000 for the self-financed courses. Students were surprised to find the enhanced fee while filling up the web options as there was no intimation from the government. The officials, without making it public, uploaded the enhanced fee on the website. The new fee will be applicable to engineering and pharmacy courses. The increased fee will be applicable for JNTU Hyderabad campus college and also in the university colleges in Manthani, Sultanpur, Jagityal and Sircilla. The OU College of Engineering has also increased the fee while colleges in Kakatiya University and Mahatma Gandhi University have refrained from doing so. Fee for new courses has been increased enormously. For example students choosing the newly introduced course Computer Science Engineering (Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning) in OUCE will have to pay ₹ 1.20 lakh per annum. Fee for B.Tech (Mining Engineering) has been fixed at ₹ 1 lakh per annum. Students are baffled with the sudden increase without any information from the government. University officials claim that the government had given them permission in July itself to increase the fee and they took the decision after discussing in the Executive Council.

Take for instance, CoffeeMug, an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered 1:1 professional networking platform enabling seamless networking for professionals, investors, and business leaders in the startup ecosystem. Founded in February 2020 by Dipti Tandon, founder of Jeevansathi.com and Magicbricks, and Abhishek Sharma, a seasoned entrepreneur, this is a video-first global platform of senior professionals that helps them connect 1:1, virtually, or over coffee, thus building a powerful, long-lasting relationship. This Singapore-based firm has seen 50,000 people joining the platform within a few months of its inception. Currently, the platform is adding over 15,000 members every month to its community. “In my experience of over two decades while working in the internet economy, there is one thing that I have witnessed and experienced multiple times—meeting the right people at the right time can prove to be a massive game-changer in one’s professional journey,” says Sharma. “I also observed that there was a pattern to it. Most of these chance meetings happened one-on-one, mostly in an informal and easy-going setting like in a coffee shop or at someone’s place. Imagine, what if Jobs hadn’t met Wozniak? Apple wouldn’t have existed at all. This posed the question – ‘What if we could make this happen at a global scale?’, that’s how the idea of Coffee Mug was born,” he reveals.

We’re looking at a growth of over 25% month-of-month,” says Tandon. CoffeeMug plans to have more than 1,00,000 members by the end of this year. “While we’ve already established our presence in more than 70 cities across 10 countries, we want to become even more prominent on a global level in the coming year. We are planning to expand its base across South East Asia and the US by the end of this year,” says Sharma, adding, “We’ve also seen multiple case studies where our members found jobs, co-founders, raised money—– all on our platform. We first met our investors on CoffeeMug, so we are proud to say that we’ve personally tasted success through our platform.” CoffeeMug has raised $6,25,000 in its pre-seed round led by Paradigm Shift Capital and AngelList India. This funding round has seen participation from marquee angel investors in India, including Archana Priyadarshni, IIM Indore Alumni Angel Fund, Yagnesh Sanghrajka, and Alok Bajpai. “We plan to use these funds to accelerate the efforts to refine CoffeeMug’s AI-based matchmaking algorithm, double its existing user base of 50,000 globally, and connect the members with genuine business opportunities,” says Tandon. The two co-founders have a series of plans they wish to put into action. “We will continue to invest in our AI-based technology stack and refine our matchmaking algorithm to make it better and more targeted in the months to come.” By the end of this year, they aim to double the member base and have more than 100,000 members on the platform. “Even though we’re already present in over 10 countries, our target is to go global in the months to come. Plus, we want to unlock real business opportunities and ease the process of hiring, partnering, mentoring, and investing verticals for our members,” they inform.

We will see the unveiling of more powerful QCs over the next five years. How prepared is India to ride the quantum technology wave? Agencies This will have a cascading effect of seeding a vibrant quantum startup ecosystem leading to job-creation and economic growth. M S Santhanam M S Santhanam is professor of physics, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune Umakant D Rapol Umakant D Rapol is professor of physics, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune L V Subramaniam L V Subramaniam is senior manager, AI science, IBM Research India In July, the European Organisation for Nuclear Research ( Cern ) announced it would deploy quantum computers (QCs) to power its search for fundamental particles. Unlike a decade ago, QCs are no more tentative prototypes, but fast emerging as a viable tool for niche practical applications ranging from designing novel materials to enabling drug discovery. QCs are now available as a cloud-based service to anyone with an internet connection. We will see the unveiling of more powerful QCs over the next five years. How prepared is India to ride the quantum technology wave? Introduced as an idea by Nobel-winning physicist Richard Feynman in the early 1980s, QCs are not merely faster versions of the computers we use but are machines based on the laws of quantum physics. A typical QC hardware computes by manipulating electrons and nuclei using electromagnetic radiation from lasers. The technology is complex as precise control over these delicate manipulation schemes is necessary to perform calculations. If this technology can be mastered, QCs promise, at least for a certain class of problems, unprecedented computational speeds not attainable even by the fastest supercomputers available today. There are a few competing hardware platforms (ion traps, superconducting qubits, etc) for a QC without a clear winner yet. Even the software stack has not been standardised. The field remains wide open for innovations. India has a unique advantage — the ability to build on its existing strengths in theoretical and experimental quantum sciences. However, to make a significant impact, India must invest in building QCs, enhancing quantum technology skill sets and seed an industry ecosystem to utilise this technology. Barring a few premier institutions, quantum computing is not yet part of the curriculum in most Indian universities and colleges. This issue must be addressed through a programme to skill faculty, enabling them to teach engineering and science undergraduates. By 2024, India’s software developer community is expected to be the largest in the world. By training this community, India can create a quantum workforce for itself and the world. GoI and the industry must support interdisciplinary research and development in quantum science and technologies. As part of the National Mission on Quantum Technologies and Applications ( NM-QTA ), the 2020 budget had committed ₹8,000 crore. Also, a Technology Innovation Hub (TIH) for quantum technologies has been set up at Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune, focused on translating research into products and services. These investments must increase. At present, private investments are lacking. Industry and PSUs must be incentivised to evaluate and work on applications relevant to their domain. Quantum technologies include a whole gamut of interrelated technologies — quantum cryptography, quantum sensors, quantum materials, quantum meteorology, etc. Products based on quantum cryptography for secure communications are already available in the market. However, unambiguous evidence of societal benefits of QCs is still lacking. Demonstrating a few showcase applications is critical to persuade industry to invest in quantum technologies. These applications could be in drug discovery, logistics and optimisation, new materials, fintech, machine learning and defence. This will have a cascading effect of seeding a vibrant quantum startup ecosystem leading to job-creation and economic growth. India must build its own competitively sized QC in mission mode by pooling its existing academic expertise. A few indigenous QCs will give India a voice in shaping the future of quantum computing. With the right policy framework and incentives, India has the potential to become a key player in a global quantum technology market anticipated to reach $31.57 billion (₹2.32 lakh crore) by 2026. This will generate more technical jobs in the coming decades. India must move fast to respond to the fast-evolving quantum landscape.

Credit: © Mitchell Foster and Adele Doyle New TU Dresden research group aims to uncover how stem cells respond to mechanical forces and electrical cues during the development and maintenance of the nervous and cardiovascular system. Dr. Adele Doyle, Assistant Professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, USA, joined the Cluster of Excellence Physics of Life (PoL) in July, 2021, to lead the research group Mechanobiology of Stem Cells at TU Dresden. Using approaches from engineering, biology, and computer science, her group studies how molecular circuits enable specialized mechanosignaling. The interdisciplinary team investigates how stem cells learn to respond to mechanical forces and electrical cues during the development of the nervous and cardiovascular systems, and how biophysical cues affect health or disease. The Doyle group seeks quantitative insights to help design cell and regenerative medicine therapies for neural and vascular applications. The Doyle lab is hosted at the Center for Regenerative Therapies Dresden (CRTD) at TU Dresden, and the Center for Systems Biology Dresden (CSBD). Cells in living organisms are surrounded by physical cues, such as mechanical forces, material properties, electrical cues, and chemical signals. Depending on the function and surroundings of cells, they experience various material properties and mechanical force inputs at different magnitudes and dynamics. “The ability of cells to take reliable decisions based on local physical cues is essential during the development of an organism and to maintain health. During disease, the normal physical cues can change, or cells can lose the ability to respond appropriately to local physical cues. For example, in the case of cancer, changes in the stiffness of tissues lead to unwanted cell proliferation and movement. The way cells sense the physical properties of surroundings is called mechanosignaling, a process that is not yet well understood,” explains group leader Adele Doyle. Dr. Adele Doyle. Credit: © Magdalena Gonciarz The Doyle lab aims to help cell and regenerative medicine therapies become more standard care options for patients who suffer from debilitating, chronic diseases. The team’s expertise lays primarily in neural and cardiovascular systems, and they also focus on the needs of patients. “Ultimately, our goal is to translate our research to the clinical context, and incorporate the insights gained from basic science research into clinical therapy designs. We enjoy collaborating with many types of groups, including from academia, industry, and medicine, at different stages throughout this process,” says Dr. Doyle. To study how mechanosignaling impacts successful embryonic development and organism homeostasis, Adele Doyle and her research group design experimental methods to take more accurate and sensitive molecular measurements in living cells and develop novel computational tools to analyze experimental data to model how cells take decisions. They also collaborate with engineering and microfabrication groups to study how controlled physical inputs affect cell behavior, such as in the case of traumatic brain injury-like impacts. “Our research is at the interface between physical sciences, such as engineering and physics, natural sciences, like chemistry and biology, medicine, and computer science. We combine three main aspects: the technology development, the mechanobiology of stem cells and their progeny, and electrogenic signaling in the nervous and cardiovascular systems,” describes Dr. Doyle. “We aim to discover how physical cues trigger changes in cellular internal molecular circuits, and subsequently cell behavior, as well as to contribute as a bridge between disciplines. For example, we initiate collaborations to help apply tools from physics and biology to address unmet medical challenges, and use data science and computation to integrate and gain insight from a wide range of experimental data sets,” Dr. Doyle adds. To meet these needs, a smooth transfer of knowledge and expertise within and between research groups and institutes is crucial. The Cluster of Excellence Physics of Life (PoL) forms a network between disciplines and is dedicated to this type of collaborative research. At PoL, scientists are fostering an environment that supports research from basic science to applications. The research focus of Dr. Doyle is an ideal fit for this interdisciplinary Cluster of Excellence. With its many life sciences research institutes and vibrant industry landscape, Dresden offers ideal conditions for such endeavors. Adele Doyle accomplished her B.Sc. in Biomedical Engineering at the Washington University in St. Louis, USA. She received her Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology & Emory University, USA, in 2010. Afterward, she did her postdoctoral research at Harvard University, USA. Since 2013 Doyle worked as Assistant Researcher (PI) at the Neuroscience Research Institute and Lecturer at the Center for Bioengineering and since 2019 as Assistant Professor at the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of California Santa Barbara, USA. Since July 1, 2021, Adele Doyle leads the research group Mechanobiology of Stem Cells at the Cluster of Excellence Physics of Life at TU Dresden.

By: Shawndrea Thomas Posted at 3:16 PM, Sep 12, 2021 and last updated 2021-09-13 09:34:29-04 TUCSON, Ariz. (KGUN) — If you shop at Fry’s, Walmart or Lowe's you’ve seen them, stand-alone patrol cameras are taking up space in Tucson parking lots. ""They really wanted to show a presence in their parking lots where they were able to help their patrons feel safer and have a feeling of control in the parking lots,"" Lindsey said. Steve Lindsey with LiveView Technologies who installs the cameras says the self-contained patrol cam has become an extra set of eyes and security in Tucson parking lots. ""Some customers have seen upwards of a 60% drop in shrinkage in the stores, some have seen 30 percent. Within the parking lots themselves they’ve seen a dramatic change in behavior,” Lindsey said. Lindsey also says the cameras use artificial intelligence technology to determine if there’s a threat in the area. ""There’s sophisticated technology in there that’s able to analyze the scene that it’s looking at and can determine what those threats are. Then based on the threat level it will alert people to take notice of that area,” Lindsey said. According to LiveView Technologies, the units are solar powered with a cellular connection. ""We call them a rapid deployment solution. They can move them around and bring them up and tear them down very quickly,” Lindsey said. Camera watchers are typically on site to respond to situations; remote command centers contact police when needed. “That human can get in and in real time they can move the cameras. They can talk through the speakers they can interact with that location. They can do that anywhere in the globe,” Lindsey said. As for pricing, it depends on how long you subscribe to the service and your needs. The cameras are used at election polling sites, construction sites and businesses of all types and sizes across the country. ------- STAY IN TOUCH WITH US ANYTIME, ANYWHERE Download our free app for Roku, FireTV, AppleTV, Alexa, and mobile devices.

While previous studies estimated premature deaths from wildfires in a specific country or region, authors of a study published Wednesday in Lancet Planetary Health say this is the most comprehensive assessment to-date of global wildfire mortality. The findings come as the smoke from yet another season of record-breaking wildfires in the Northern Hemisphere impacts air quality hundreds of miles away from burn areas. “Policy makers and public health professionals should raise awareness of wildfire pollution to guide prompt public responses and take actions to reduce exposure,” write the study authors. The study authors first estimated daily fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) concentration using a combination of machine learning, ground measurements, weather conditions, and chemical transport models. They then cross-referenced those pollution levels with data on more than 65 million deaths from 2000-2016 across 749 cities in 43 countries to get city-specific death estimates from wildfires. They found that short-term exposure to wildfire PM 2.5 pollution caused, on average, 33,150 deaths a year in the countries looked at in the study, with an estimated 6,993 cardiovascular deaths and 3,503 respiratory-related deaths a year. Of the countries studied, Guatemala had the highest proportion of estimated deaths from wildfire smoke, followed by Thailand and Paraguay. The authors note that all the mortality data used in the study comes from cities, and that the study is not a comprehensive look at global mortality; for example, although wildfires have burned more than 40 million acres in Siberia this summer, no Russian cities were included in the study. Far-Reaching Impacts of Wildfires Lead author Yuming Guo, professor of global environmental health and biostatistics at Monash University, told EHN that he was surprised to see that citizens from certain countries that don’t have frequent wildfires, like France and Germany, were still harmed from wildfire smoke. PM 2.5 refers to particles that are 2.5 microns or smaller in diameter — for reference, a human hair is about 70 microns wide . Because of their small size, these fine particles can travel deep into the lungs, where they can damage airways and enter the bloodstream. Children, infants, older adults and people who already have heart and lung conditions are especially at-risk from PM 2.5 pollution. While wildfires are far from the only source of PM 2.5 pollution in cities, the study authors found that PM 2.5 exposure from wildfires was more deadly, and longer-lasting, than fine particle pollution from other urban sources. They suspect that’s in part because of the chemical makeup and smaller size of the particles in wildfire smoke. Wildfire smoke also contributes to suicide, diabetes, renal diseases, and other conditions, said Guo. The study authors suggest that future research should look at the mortality data by age, sex, and other factors to better understand who is most vulnerable. Climate change is worsening wildfires by making wildfire-prone parts of the world, like California and Australia, hotter and drier.

Databricks Databricks, Confluent, and MongoDB surged this summer in the private and public markets. All three companies built their businesses on open-source software, which they give away for free. Their success shows open source can thrive, even competing against Amazon's and Microsoft's clouds. See more stories on Insider's business page . It's been a blockbuster summer for the open-source-software companies Confluent, Databricks, and MongoDB. Confluent went public in June and now has a $15 billion market cap. Databricks announced that it raised $1.6 billion in funding at a $38 billion valuation in August. MongoDB's market cap surged to $32 billion this month - almost as much as the $34 billion price tag IBM paid to buy Red Hat , the open-source company that was an early pioneer of successfully commercializing the same code it gave away for free. All these companies started as open-source projects , or software that's free for anyone to use, download, or modify. And while giving away software may sound counterintuitive, the success of Confluent, Databricks, and MongoDB show that the model can provide the fuel for a company to take off - even in the era of Amazon's, Microsoft's, and Google's dominance of the cloud market and their combined resources and hold over developers. It should be said that open-source software is not a promise of business success, despite the triumphs of those companies. Firms such as Docker , Cloudera , and NPM (now a GitHub subsidiary) have all encountered turbulence that showcase the difficulties of turning even the most popular open-source projects into real challengers to the tech titans. At the same time, Joseph Jacks, the founder and general partner of OSS Capital, suggested that while Databricks, MongoDB, and Confluent all made smart moves with excellent market timing, open source was foundational to the success they're now enjoying. ""I think open source is fundamentally the best way to build infrastructure technology and, in particular, data-infrastructure technology,"" Jacks told Insider. And as the Greylock partner Jerry Chen laid out in a recent post , companies such as Confluent and Databricks are thriving in the gaps where cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, and Google Cloud aren't or haven't yet become entrenched. ""Successful open source projects like Spark or Kafka can be a strategic advantage because the project and related commercial companies come to market with a community of developers they can sell to,"" Chen recently told Forbes . ""More generally, looking for an advantage around go-to-market or distribution is key in competing with the big cloud."" Hugely valuable companies are being born from open source Databricks' business is based on the fast-growing Apache Spark data science project, which started out of a lab at the University of California, Berkeley. Confluent's founders built its technology using Apache Kafka, which started at LinkedIn, and MongoDB started as a database project of the same name. Dev Ittycheria, the CEO of MongoDB. MongoDB Releasing software as open source allows more people to use a technology and, importantly, increases its prominence: Big firms and individual developers alike turn to it not only because it's free but also because popular projects have thriving communities that are always improving the software. Integrating open-source code can dramatically speed up a software-development project, without sacrificing quality. ""Generally, if I'm a new IT-development person in a large bank, the first thing I do is go to open source and look at the things I could use, so I don't need to build any of that stuff,"" said Alfred Chuang, a general partner at Race Capital. These companies tend to rely on a business model called ""open core,"" which means that while the open-source component of their product remains free, it builds a paid version of the same software with enhanced customer support or additional features, aimed at large customers. This, in turn, helps make popular open-source projects palatable to even the biggest customers and provides companies such as Confluent and Databricks a route to success. ""Really, what we end up seeing is, if you can build a company that commands a lion's share of attention and go the managed-services route, the market is going to reward that,"" said Stephen O'Grady, a principal analyst at RedMonk. Open source can be a competitive advantage, but it also includes risks To Ali Ghodsi , Databricks' cofounder and CEO, open source is ""one of the main tenets"" of his company's strategy because it created a massive ecosystem of developers around the product that's hard to match. ""Millions and millions of people just use the open source, and it's hard for any other vendor to grab control of those communities and lead those communities,"" Ghodsi recently told Insider. It's also one of the startup's advantages over its $95 billion data-cloud rival Snowflake . ""If you have a proprietary piece of software like Snowflake, you don't have that community of open-source vendors, open-source adopters around it,"" he said. Databricks also employs a model where the companies that build software on its open source have ""connectors"" that increase the usage of Databricks via their mutual customers. ""If someone is using some partner software that's working directly with Databricks, that drives more credits on Databricks, and that grows our revenue,"" Ghodsi said. Still, cloud providers such as AWS have increasingly brought their power to bear on competing directly with open-source firms, offering their own commercial versions of free software such as Kafka - the same open-source technology that Confluent uses. Some firms , including Confluent and MongoDB , have moved away from a traditional, more permissive approach to open source in response, opting instead for new licenses that limit the way the software can be used . Jay Kreps, the cofounder and CEO of Confluent. Confluent Ultimately, while there are certainly unique challenges in selling free software - challenges that not all can meet - this new class of open-source tech giants shows that the market is real and lucrative for those who are able to rise to the demands of the moment. Jacks, the OSS Capital investor, said, ""With the last 15 years of developments in infrastructure software, it's been obvious to the world that the majority of really exciting tools and technologies that developers care about have come from the open-source ecosystem.""

But raw data consists of garbage, irregular and inconsistent values which lead to many difficulties. Dirty data will always yield inaccurate and worthless results even after analysis until it is cleaned up well. If the data is of low and unclean quality, then the decisions made by the organizations based on that data will be ineffective and incorrect. If the data is incorrect, outcomes and algorithms will always be unreliable, even though they may look correct. That is why data hygiene and data cleansing are critical to ensure that data integrity is maintained. In this article, we will be talking about two such methods that are used to improve the quality of data, Data Cleaning And Normalization and discuss how and why they are important. Table of Contents What is Data Cleaning? Methods For Data Cleaning What is Data Normalization? Methods for Data Normalization Cleaning and Normalization In Python Conclusion What is Data Cleaning? Data Cleaning is a critical aspect of the domain of data management. The data cleansing process involves reviewing all the data present within a database to either remove or update information that is incomplete, incorrect or duplicated and irrelevant. Data cleansing is just not simply about erasing the old information to make space for new data, but the process is about rather finding a way to maximize the dataset’s accuracy without necessarily tampering with the data available. Data Cleaning is the process of determining and correcting the wrong data. Organizations rely on data for most things but only a few properly address the data quality. Utilizing the effectiveness and use of data can tremendously increase the reliability and value of the brand.  Hence, Business enterprises have started giving more importance to data quality. Data Cleaning includes many more actions than just removing the data, the process also requires fixing wrong spellings and syntactical errors, correcting and filling of empty fields, and identifying duplicate records to name a few. Data cleaning is considered a foundational step for data science basics, as it plays an important role in an analytical process that helps uncover reliable answers. Improving the data quality through data cleaning can eliminate problems like expensive processing errors and incorrect invoices. Follow us on Google News>> Data quality is also very important as several pieces of data like customer information are always changing and evolving. Although there is no one such absolute way to describe the precise steps in the data cleaning process as the processes vary from dataset to dataset it plays an important part in deriving reliable answers. The crucial motive of data cleaning is to construct uniform and standardized data sets that enable the analytical tools and business intelligence easy access and help to perceive accurate data for each problem. Image Source Methods For Data Cleaning There are several techniques for producing reliable and hygienic data through data cleaning. Some of the data cleaning methods are as follows : The first and basic need in data cleaning is to remove the unwanted observations. This process includes removing duplicate or irrelevant observations. Irrelevant observations are ones that do not fit with the problem statement one is trying to solve. Making sure that the data is irrelevant and that you won’t need to clean it again is a great way to begin. Getting rid of unwanted outliers is another method because outliers can cause problems with certain models. Removing outliers will not only help with the model’s performance but also improve its accuracy. Although one should make sure that there is a legitimate reason to remove them. Small mistakes are often made when numbers are entered. If there are any mistakes present with the numbers being entered, it needs to be changed to actual readable data. All of the data presents will have to be converted so that the numbers are readable by the system. Data types should be uniform across all of the datasets. A string can’t be termed as numeric nor can a numeric be a boolean value. Correcting missing values is another important method that can’t be ignored. Knowing how to handle missing values will help keep the data clean. At times, there might be too many missing values present in a single column. For such occurrences, there might not be enough data to work with, so deleting the column may stand as the best option in such cases. There are also other different ways to impute missing data values in the dataset. This can be done by estimating what the missing data might just be and performing linear regression or median can help calculate this. Fixing the typos as a result of human error is important and one can fix typos through multiple algorithms and techniques. One of the methods can be to map the values and convert them into their correct spelling. Typos are essential to fix because models treat different values differently. Strings present in data rely a lot on their spellings and cases. What is Data Normalization? Normalization is the process of organizing data from a database. This includes processes like creating tables and establishing relationships between those tables according to the rules designed to protect the data as well as to make the database more flexible by eliminating the redundancy and inconsistency present. Data normalization is the method of organizing data to appear similar across all records and fields. Performing so always results in getting higher quality data. This process basically includes eliminating unstructured data and duplicates in order to ensure logical data storage. When data normalization is performed correctly a higher value of insights are generated. In machine learning, some feature values at times differ from others multiple times. The features with higher values will always dominate the learning process. However, it does not mean that those variables are more important to predict the outcome of the model. Data normalization transforms the multiscaled data all to the same scale. After normalization, all variables have a similar weightage on the model, hence improving the stability and performance of the learning algorithm. Normalization gives equal importance to each variable so that no single variable drives the model performance. It also prevents any issues created from database modifications such as insertions, deletions, and updates. For businesses to achieve further heights needs to regularly perform data normalization. It is one of the most important things that can be done to get rid of errors that make an analysis of data a complicated and difficult task. With normalization, an organization can make the most of its data as well as invest in data gathering at a greater, more efficient level. Methods for Data Normalization There are several methods for performing Data Normalization, few of the most popular techniques are as follows : The min-max normalization is the simplest of all methods as it converts floating-point feature values from their natural range into a standard range, usually between 0 and 1. It is a good choice when one knows the approximate upper and lower bounds on the data with few or no outliers and the data are approximately uniformly distributed across that range. Decimal place normalization can be done with data tables having numerical data types. By default, the algorithm places two digits after the decimal for normal comma-separated numbers. One can decide on how many decimals are required to scale this throughout the table. Z-score normalization is a methodology of normalizing the data and hence helps avoid the issue of outliers in the data. Here, μ is considered the mean value of the feature and σ is the standard deviation from the data points. If a value comes to be equal to the mean of all the values present, only then will it be normalized to 0. If it is below the mean value, it will be considered to be a negative number, and if it is above the mean value it will be termed as a positive number. The number of the negative and positives are determined by the standard deviation of the original feature. Cleaning and Normalization of Data In Python Using Python we can easily perform Data Cleaning and Normalization. Here I have tried to demonstrate an example using Python and Numpy, to demonstrate the difference between the general data and normalized data. import pandas as pd import numpy as np  from scipy import stats  from mlxtend.preprocessing import minmax_scaling  import seaborn as sns import matplotlib.pyplot as plt You might highly consider normalizing your data if you are going to implement a machine learning or statistical technique that comes with the assumption of your data being normally distributed. Some examples of these include linear regression, T-tests and Gaussian naive Bayes. Now let’s see what normalizing data looks like: See Also Developers Corner When to Use One-Hot Encoding in Deep Learning? normalized_data = stats.boxcox(original_data)  fig, ax=plt.subplots(1,2) sns.distplot(original_data, ax=ax[0]) ax[0].set_title(""Original Data"") sns.distplot(normalized_data[0], ax=ax[1]) ax[1].set_title(""Normalized data"") Output : We can notice that the shape of our data has changed. Before normalizing it was almost L-shaped, but after normalizing, it looks more like a bell-shaped curve. This helps us ensure that the data is now properly skewed and scaled! Conclusion As we have discussed, data cleaning and normalization each has their own importance to help ensure the quality of the data for analysis becomes up to the mark. Both these methods have their own benefits and different methodologies that are highly important, especially in generating higher accuracies from models. In this article, we understood what Data Cleaning and Normalization are, their importance and the various methods through which both can be implemented. We also saw a small example of data normalization and what difference it makes in aspects of data processing. I would encourage the reader to explore and try these methods by oneself to understand the importance and benefits. Happy Learning!

(“BioXcel” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: BTAI), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company utilizing artificial intelligence approaches to develop transformative medicines in neuroscience and immuno-oncology, today announced that updates from its ongoing Phase 1b/2 trial of BXCL701, the Company's investigational, oral innate immunity activator, in aggressive forms of prostate cancer will be presented in a poster session at the 2021 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress, which will take place virtually from September 16-21, 2021. POSTER PRESENTATION DETAILS Title: BXCL701 — 1 st -in-class oral activator of systemic innate immunity — combined with pembrolizumab, in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC): Phase 2 results Poster Session: Genitourinary Tumors, Prostate Time: Available starting on September 15 at 6:05 PM EST Poster Number: 610P The abstracts are currently available on the ESMO website at www.esmo.org . At the start of the poster sessions, the poster will be available in the “News & Media” section of the Company’s website at www.bioxceltherapeutics.com . About BXCL701 BXCL701 is an investigational orally administered innate immune activator designed to initiate inflammation in the tumor microenvironment. Approved and experimental immunotherapies often struggle to address cancers that appear “cold” or uninflamed. Therefore, BXCL701 may render “cold” tumors “hot,” making them more detectable by the adaptive immune system and thereby facilitating the development of a strong anti-cancer immune response. BioXcel’s preclinical data supports BXCL701’s synergy with both current checkpoint inhibitor-based therapies and emerging immunotherapies directed to activate T-cells, such as IL-2. BXCL701 is currently being developed as therapy for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer of adenocarcinoma and treatment emergent Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer (tNEPC) phenotypes (both “cold” tumors) and other advanced solid cancers that are “hot” or have become resistant to checkpoint inhibitors. Story continues About BioXcel Therapeutics, Inc. BioXcel Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company utilizing artificial intelligence approaches to develop transformative medicines in neuroscience and immuno-oncology. BioXcel’s drug re-innovation approach leverages existing approved drugs and/or clinically validated product candidates together with big data and proprietary machine learning algorithms to identify new therapeutic indices. BioXcel’s two most advanced clinical development programs are BXCL501, an investigational, proprietary, orally dissolving thin film formulation of dexmedetomidine for the treatment of agitation associated with psychiatric and neurological disorders, and BXCL701, an investigational, orally administered, systemic innate immunity activator in development for the treatment of aggressive forms of prostate cancer and advanced solid tumors that are refractory or treatment naïve to checkpoint inhibitors.

One way to solve the debate about whether to build a future tank for 2030 or simply continue to upgrade the Abrams main battle tank, may simply be to do both. That may be the Army approach, as the service appears to both be massively upgrading its classic 70-ton main battle tank while also moving quickly to make a decision in 2023 on concepts for a new platform called the “Optionally Manned Tank.” Optionally Manned TankThe Optionally Manned Tank is now purely in a conceptual stage, as the Army Science Board and Ground Vehicle Systems Center are currently exploring the “realm of the possible” regarding what kinds of technologies, platforms and weapons might best contribute to a new generation of tank-like vehicles. “We are gathering information in the form of studies and technology maturation,” Maj. Gen. Ross Coffman, Director, Next Generation Combat Vehicle Cross Functional Team, Army Futures Command, said in an interview with The National Interest. Interestingly, while the actual tactical function and impact of the new platform is intended to generate an extremely lethal, survivable “tank-like” impact on the battlefield, the platform itself may not even look like a tank, Coffman said. “I have gone on record saying I don’t care if it’s a tank. I don’t care if it hovers and shoots lasers. It just needs to be able to go into the nastiest places on earth and fight and win, with the key component being survivability on the battlefield, This is all pre-decisional, but we want to generate as many options for the senior leaders so they can make an informed decision,” Coffman told me. Could there be some kind of future air-ground armored hovering attack platform? Able to fire lasers and rockets from the air at low altitudes before advancing on land? May seem a bit wild, but the sky is likely the limit when it comes to Army innovators, and places like the Army Research Lab and DARPA are bound to be exploring seemingly unimaginable technological possibilities. There are bound to be a wide array of options and contingencies now being explored, depending upon the perceived boundaries of emerging, next-generation technologies. Most likely, the new Optionally Manned Tank will be a lightweight, expeditionary and maneuverable ground vehicle. However, the principle quandary likely being entertained right now is whether something faster with less armor can actually be survivable enough to operate in heavy mechanized warfare in a manner comparable to or greater than the Abrams? If it cannot survive the kinds of attacks and incoming fire an Abrams is built for, will it have enough active protection? Long range sensors? Fire power range, reach and guidance technology? The course chosen by the Army will likely rely upon what kinds of answers there may be to these questions. U.S. Army M1A2 Abrams TankAn M1A2 Abrams tanks assigned to 1st Battalion, 66th Armor Regiment, 3rd Armored Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division, fires a 120mm Sabot tank round at a target during Gunnery Live Fire Qualifications at the Udairi Range Complex, Kuwait U.S. Army Nonetheless, the considerations point to the aforementioned possibility that perhaps a new optionally manned tank can complement and fight alongside a heavily armored tank, that is if there are not lightweight composites or any technical breakthrough sufficient to architect a lighter vehicle equivalent or superior to an Abrams in terms of survivability. Specifics related to these questions may not be available, for obvious and understandable security reasons, yet there is evidence in the Army current path forward, which is to both massively pursue Abrams upgrades and sustainment while concurrently pursuing a new tank-platform for the future. The answer may be both, based upon the evidence thus far. One significant idea bearing upon these kinds of evaluation relates to a concept described to me by Army Futures Command Commander Gen. John Murray, and that is that should unmanned technology sufficiently evolve to enable breakthrough levels of autonomy, a future tank might not need to be survivable as it will carry no soldiers. The technology for advanced algorithms needs to advance a bit more before new levels of autonomy are operational, Murray said, yet progress is underway and rapid progress continues to hit new breakthroughs on a regular basis. Also, certain kinds of autonomy are already here and demonstrating great promise in Army testing and experimentation. As far back as a year or two ago, Army Futures Command demonstrated that an armored robotic vehicle could “breach” an enemy tank ditch while soldiers themselves operated several hundred meters behind. U.S. Army Assault Breacher VehicleThe Assault Breacher Vehicle (ABV) is a highly mobile and heavily armored minefield and complex obstacle breaching system. U.S. Army The advantage here is extremely significant, as the most dangerous, high-risk and life-threatening circumstances can increasingly be handled by unmanned systems, freeing up human decision makers to make optimized decisions about improved methods of attack. Manned-Unmanned TeamingOnce a tank ditch is handled, crossed or removed as an impediment, or early rounds of incoming enemy fire are confronted, infantry and heavily armed manned vehicles can approach or “close with an enemy” with a much greater tactical advantage increasing the prospect for mission success. This does not mean, Murray suggested, that the unique attributes of human cognition will be replaced or unnecessary in any capacity, but rather than advanced, AI-enabled algorithms will increasingly be able to support long-range manned-unmanned teaming and information connectivity between manned vehicles and forward operating drones. Perhaps a manned Abrams will bring its heavy armor, survivability and firepower to war, while performing command and control operations and making decisions for an ultra high-tech future Optionally Manned Tank to fight alongside it. U.S. Army M1A2 Abrams TankThe M1A2 Abrams Tank on a training exercise at the National Training Center Fort Irwin, California U.S. Army This might make a lot of sense, as a robotic tank could move faster, deploy more easily and surge forward into incoming fire with no risk to soldiers. Yet the platform could be supported by human decision makers in a heavily armored tank operating nearby. Advances with the Abrams tank, for instance, might favor this kind of conceptual thinking, especially if a new generation of Forward Looking Infrared Sensors enable tanks to find, track and attack enemy targets at safe standoff distances before it is seen. Optimizing this kind of approach, which both Coffman and Murray have explained as both manned-unmanned teaming and even unmanned-unmanned teaming, requires a growing a sought after blending between attributes and functions unique to humans and tasks performed by computers in an exponentially superior fashion. Artificial Intelligence“We use artificial intelligence to reduce the cognitive burden on the human to allow the machine to do what it does best and allow humans to do what they do best on the battlefield. What is the essence of decision-making when it comes to assessing those items that are not exactly tangible? Where there is not a ones and zeros solution…and answers come through with experience and anticipation. Currently, humans are better at game theory than machines,” Coffman said. When it comes to aggregating incoming sensor data, discerning targets, performing real-time analytics, organizing threat data and making recommendations to human decision-makers in seconds, nothing can parallel AI-enabled systems. At the same time, as indicated by Coffman, less tangible or more subjective variables vital to warfare decision making go well beyond the capacity of 1s and 0s. There are many elements of decision making which, for instance, pertain to psychological nuances, emotional considerations regarding the level of risk to soldiers and interwoven factors such as how to respond to several new developments intersecting at once. In essence, there are circumstances wherein human reasoning and cognitive processes place humans in a much better position to make determinations. Warfare maneuvers involve degrees of risk taking, damage assessment possibilities and even some informed speculation which might create a need to make decisions which exceed or venture beyond the analytical capabilities of mathematically-oriented machines and advanced algorithms. “Currently humans are better at game theory than machines,” Coffman told me. These things considered, the fast-advancing capabilities of AI are staggering. For example, AI-enable systems can increasingly analyze a variety of variables all in relation to one another in seconds, drawing upon a seemingly limitless database of catalogued data. How might weather conditions inform or alter operational considerations? How does this relate to surrounding terrain? In past scenarios, which kinds of maneuvers or counterattack choices proved most effective against enemy attacks. An AI system is only as effective as its database, yet advanced algorithms are increasingly able to discern how things like weather, terrain, incoming enemy fire and past operations can all inform choices in a fast-evolving new situation…and this can be done in seconds. So the way this works is that optimal courses of action, based on instant, yet extensive and extremely sophisticated analysis, can be presented to human decision makers. In terms of how this might be applied, some of Coffman’s discussions about preparing for specific geographical or enemy conditions can be greatly informed by AI. Geographical specifics in places like Eastern Europe, for example, can be catalogued and analyzed in relation to an armored attack. Computer databases can aggregate, distill and analyze geographical conditions with a specific mind to how they may impact warfare maneuvers. Coffman explained that knowing the terrain in Eastern Europe, for example, could prove extremely useful. “We don’t play home games, so what is the terrain in Eastern Europe? What is the terrain of the Indo-Pacific? We have to have the required mobility to be in a position of advantage. We have to transit local roads and infrastructure,” he said. Abrams Battle Tank ModernizationWhat might all of this mean when it comes to the future of the Abrams tank? Has it reached the end of the line in terms of upgrade potential? The answer seems to be no, in large measure due to the series of aforementioned factors such as high-speed computing, long-range thermal sights, ammunition datalinks and perhaps most of all, the impact of AI-capable technologies. Apart from a few external design configurations related to things like the vehicle chassis, turret and 120mm cannon, today’s Abrams is an entirely new vehicle when compared with its inception, or even a few years ago. The existing v3 variant and fast-emerging v4, for example, introduce paradigm-changing technologies capable of impacting Abrams tactics to a substantial degree. The Abrams will operate with an ability to attack at longer ranges, control unmanned systems, integrate new generations of survivability-enhancing Active Protection Systems and gather, analyze and transmit targeting data and other vital information in seconds. This changes combat. For example, many likely remember reading about the now famous Gulf War tank battles which were in large measure won with advanced thermal sights. U.S. Army Abrams tanks were able to see and destroy Iraqi T-72s before they were seen themselves, allowing them to attack and hit enemy tanks without facing incoming attack. Advanced Abrams tanks take this kind of technology to yet a much greater, paradigm changing level in terms of range, image fidelity, an ability to track multiple targets at once and draw upon AI-enabled target analysis. Moving into the future, an Abrams will be able to possibly operate smaller, faster, armed robotic vehicles moving ahead to enemy contact, while receiving and analyzing real-time video feeds and data from overhead drones and even surveillance planes. Then, as was already demonstrated last year during the Army’s Project Convergence exercise, AI-empowered computer systems can instantly perform analyses to pair sensor-to-shooter and tell human decision-makers which weapon, counterattack or operational response is best suited to the specific conditions of a given combat circumstance. Perhaps there is a drone attack coming from an urban area or enemy infantry moving through a friendly population? An AI system would discern all of these variables, factor in weather, geography, potential impact to civilians and compare it against an established database. The computer database will not only be able to bounce new variables off of what has worked in the past for similar scenarios but, for example, potentially recommend a non-kinetic solution such as an EW system to jam a drone or laser to pinpoint approaching enemy vehicles to reduce explosive fragmentation and limit damage to civilians. A human decision maker can then be informed of an optimal method of attack, based upon a massively integrated, yet immediate computer analysis. All of this means platforms such as the Abrams, especially when upgraded with AI-capable systems, an ability to operate drones and an instant capacity to receive, aggregate and analyze incoming sensor data, can continue to bring an unparalleled advantage to the battlefield. These advantages for the Abrams are fortified by a large number of current and ongoing upgrades to the Abrams tank v3 and v4 variants. These include a number of things such as ammunition data link, auxiliary power units to support a huge increase in computing, electronics and on-board power, multi-purpose, programmable ammunition able to function as a High-Energy Anti-Tank round, sabo round, kinetic energy round or canister round as needed. This reduces the logistical footprint and massively increases lethality. This kind of tactical approach, performed by an Army AI system called Firestorm during Project Convergence, emerged due to the instant organization and analysis of data from mini-drones, satellites, ground vehicles, helicopters, large drones and even dismounted infantry … at one time. A decision making process made exponentially faster, reducing attack time from 20 mins to 20 secs, can give a strategic advantage to even a much smaller force,” Coffman explained. “You must possess the capability to fight outnumbered and achieve victory,” Coffman said. Coffman explained that all of these factors, investments and areas of technological focus pertain to specific calculations regarding potential enemy forces. “We cannot modernize to parity, we must modernize to overmatch. We must look at what our potential adversaries are investing in and then project what the capabilities will be,” he told me. Please note: This content carries a strict local market embargo.

As games and gaming platforms become more complex and drive more revenue, companies are under increasing pressure to deliver seamless yet secure customer experiences. Many are looking to continuous intelligence (CI) to help navigate matters and improve operations. However, challenges in the market may be keeping gaming organizations from stepping fully into the potential continuous intelligence has. Why gaming needs continuous intelligence Continuous intelligence is a machine-driven approach to harnessing the power of data for insights. It can process massive data inputs in real-time, placing organizations in a position to pivot quickly and scale as necessary. The gaming industry relies on cutting-edge technology to deliver fantastic customer experiences. That hasn’t changed from the very first Atari consoles, but the sheer number of machines, devices, and systems on the network has changed the rules for the industry. Gaming companies must account for this inconsistency without sacrificing a seamless experience to take full advantage of the market. Gaming also requires high-performance standards, no matter how many devices access the network. These market pressures require a different processing solution for gaming companies looking to distinguish themselves in a crowded market. See also: How Continuous Intelligence Cuts Through Complexity Challenges in the industry Gaming presents some unique challenges that traditional operating systems cannot address. Let’s explore some of the biggest issues facing the gaming industry today in terms of technological logistics. Lack of visibility: The gaming industry is fragmented, storing and deploying products across many different systems. Troubleshooting problems requires accessing a multitude of different logs. The industry needs a central command to solve issues quickly. Lack of scalable investigation: When problems happen, gaming can respond, but it often misses the “why” behind these disruptions. Gaming companies need tools that can leverage big data to uncover insights in minutes, not hours. Lack of pipeline support: Gaming companies operate on DevOps principles, requiring rapid updates and software release. Too much manual monitoring of these pipelines leads to wasted developer time and slower issue resolution. Lack of robust security: Gaming companies are entrusted with highly sensitive data. New game frameworks must operate from a security-first principle that maintains compliance without overly restricting game access. Lack of scalability: Games don’t operate with the same clear trajectory. Gaming companies experience bursts of unpredictable data ingest, and they need a solution that doesn’t penalize them. Continuous intelligence addresses these challenges by providing an intelligent pipeline for data analysis that speeds resolution time. It offers the kind of scalable solution gaming companies need to maintain a constant cycle of development and compliance without lags in gameplay. To implement CI in the gaming industry, companies need: Self-provisioning SaaS with low to no maintenance Algorithms for advanced analytics, i.e., machine learning models. Out of the box integrations for fast implementation Security first integrations for compliance ( GDPR , etc.) Flexible licensing Benefits of Continuous Intelligence CI offers several benefits for the overall customer experience—something gaming companies need to remain relevant. Seamless experiences: Centralizing monitoring and analysis ensure issues resolve quickly, and companies can execute updates without delay. Robust security: CI analysis finds security breaches faster with fewer false positives. Accelerate innovation: With machine learning support, developers can better push updates and new products on a faster timeline. Continuous monitoring: Automating monitoring removes complexity and facilitates the DevOps cycle for gaming. CI is foundational for gaming innovation Continuous intelligence facilities the ideals of the gaming industry in a complex, massive data-driven world. As companies struggle to balance privacy and security compliance with real-time updates and seamless customer experiences, continuous intelligence could be the path forward.

She notes that the unofficial numbers show close to 400 students living on campus and online enrollment down after an all-time high in fall 2020. Here's what she had to say in her recent greeting: ""Greetings from the University of Minnesota Crookston. We have many exciting things happening on campus as we welcome students, faculty and staff back. If you have visited campus over the past 2-3 weeks, I know that you have felt the renewed positive energy on campus as students are engaging in a more fully in-person collegiate experience. First Day Our first day of classes was Tuesday, August 24. First day enrollment, while unofficial until October, has fewer people on campus this year than last and online enrollment is also down from our all time high in fall 2020. However the decline mostly is due to lagging recruitment numbers because of the limitations COVID placed on in-person recruitment events and campus visits. We believe COVID and its impact on the economy is affecting student willingness and ability to enroll. We’ve got some exciting initiatives in the hopper that we think will help us to rebound. Some of these will start as soon as January. Do note, this is preliminary information. Official enrollment stats for all University of Minnesota campuses will be available in early October to account for late registrations and/or movement of students among colleges and campuses in the first weeks of the semester. The number of students choosing to live on campus is just shy of 400, with more students choosing to live on campus after their first year. Over the years we have had many regional students attending UMN Crookston while concurrently completing their high school degree. To-date we have a record-setting 74 PSEO students enrolled with increases seen in both on campus and online delivery of Post Secondary Enrollment Option (PSEO) credits. COVID-19 We continue to closely follow state and federal guidance, public health data, science, and accompanying trends, and the best advice of the University’s own medical and public health experts. We know that even here in Crookston, many people are looking for credible information about the Covid vaccines. I encourage you to visit the “Just the Vax Facts,” “Great Questions and Some Answers,“ and the “Why and Where FAQ“ web pages with information from Jacob Tolar, the Dean of the University of Minnesota Medical School and Vice President for Clinical Affairs. The University of Minnesota System requires compliance with the Vax 2.0 program for all students including those completing courses online and those living in other states and countries. We held a vaccination clinic on campus at the Wellness Center on Thursday, Sept. 2 with 37 people choosing to get their vaccines. The clinic was part of the commitment the University holds to the health and well-being of all our students. Students have until October 8 to complete a survey documenting that they are vaccinated.  The two exemptions are a medical exemption, which requires a doctor’s signature on a UMN form, or a sincerely held religious exemption, which requires a notarized signature by the student on a UMN form. As with our other required immunizations, we will place a registration hold on the account of any students who do not comply, and we will lift the hold as soon as they are in compliance. Employees are required to attest that they have received the COVID-19 vaccination or are testing on a regular basis if they have not received the immunization.  They must do this by September 17. Facial Covering Compliance The UMN facial covering policy requires that all students and employees properly wear a facial covering when indoors or in an enclosed space. This is especially important given the highly contagious nature of the Delta variant and strong scientific evidence that facial coverings are highly effective in preventing the spread of Covid when worn properly. Maroon and Gold Fridays Maroon and Gold Fridays are back. Regal the Golden Eagle, students, faculty and/or staff will be visiting businesses on Fridays. Beginning September 2021 through April 2022. Any participating and registered Maroon and Gold business/organization wearing maroon and gold during that visit will win maroon and gold swag and even game passes to UMN Crookston Athletics games. Winners will then be entered into a drawing to win the grand prize of a $150 office party pack from a local establishment. Two office parties will be awarded one at the end of fall and spring semesters, along with maroon and gold swag. Register your business and/or organization to participate. We are thrilled to have our campus bustling again. Ox Cart week included several events on campus. I hope you had an opportunity to attend some of the many events celebrating retirements, the dedication of the Charles H. Casey Equine Arena, welcoming our new students back and the many activities of Ox Cart Days. Thank you to so many of you who worked very hard to make the events within the community and on campus go flawlessly. Come visit us again soon, consider attending one or more of our athletic events, and watch for our upcoming Teambacker Tailgate on Sunday, September 11 at noon. Come cheer on our women’s soccer team and their home opener vs Michigan Technological University; game starts at 1 p.m. We will be celebrating the success of our baseball team with a short ceremony prior to the Alumni game on Saturday, September 18.  We hope to see you at these events and others.""

During the event, David Cieslak, Chief Data Scientist for Aunalytics, will discuss the use of natural language interface synthesis of SQL database queries leveraging the company’s new NL2SQL System. Natural language interface integration with database environments is a growing field that enables end users to interact with relational databases without technical database skills. These interfaces solve the problem of synthesizing SQL queries based on natural language input from the user. There are considerable research interests around the topic but there are few systems to date that are deployed on top of active enterprise data marts. At ECML-PKDD 2021, Aunalytics will introduce the NL2SQL system and present on data simulations that provide adaptive feedback for continuous model advancement.

You Can Use Artificial Intelligence Adobe Stock Smart machines are created with smart processes. That includes AI, digital twins, and AR. Rob Spiegel | Sep 13, 2021 As industrial machines are becoming more connected and flexible, the process of building and commissioning the machine is also getting smarter. Machines are built now using artificial intelligence, digital twins, and augmented reality. We caught up with Rahul Garg, VP of industrial machinery and mid-market program at Siemens Digital Industries Software. Garg explained the process of creating smart industrial machines using advanced technology. Related: 10 new machines answer food packaging demands Design News: Is artificial intelligence becoming a major factor in building industrial machines? Rahul Garg: When you think of AI, one of the key ingredients is real-time data. It takes a lot of data to improve the way you’re making decisions. If you think about a machine performing under certain conditions, those conditions don’t stay the same. Depending on the environment, the conditions can change. A spinning machine handling soft fabrics changes based on humidity and other environmental factors. Not all machines run in an air-conditioned environment, so being able to monitor the changes and using AI, helps you adapt to the variables. The weaving speed needs to change based on these factors so you don’t mess up the cloth. Maybe you need to stop and send a signal to the right person. You can build upon that and adjust your processes based on the data. So you find a way to gather the data and let AI make the decisions so your decisions will be more pragmatic and effective. Related: Machines Text and Tweet, Eliminates Need to Write Custom Code DN: Another aspect of AI is the digital twin. Are digital twins becoming more of a factor in building machines? Rahul Garg: We use a digital twin when we design machines. All of the things involved in designing the machine are supported by the digital twin. You don’t have to have a physical replica to create the machine. You can look at the digital twin to improve the machine or troubleshoot it. An executable digital twin with AI can demonstrate how the machine is supposed to operate. More and more decisions can be made on the machine by using a virtual replica. That helps us make a smart machine smarter. DN: How is cloud connectivity playing in building and monitoring machines? How does edge computing fit in? Rahul Garg: We use cloud solutions for the engineering and the design of the processes themselves. We saw a big jump in cloud use with COVID-19. The cloud made things more possible. The automation folks were connected in a cloud environment to do their engineering and manufacturing work. The equipment is running at the customer's site. That’s where the cloud becomes interesting. When you’re trying to get data from customers to do proactive maintenance, you need data that shows how the machine is performing. Without the could it would be hard to know that. Using the cloud is part of serving the customer better. Once the cloud process is started for IoT cloud-based analytics, they realize they need the ability to perform some computing right at the machine site itself. We have to figure out when we need the data to come back to us and when it’s not necessary. We have this whole edge solution for machine builders to manage the data coming from the machines. They need to monitor the machines, but they also need some of the decisions to be made right at the edge. DN: How about flexibility and agility? Do your customers seek solutions that allow them to change up quickly and easily? Companies that can deliver a customized machine most efficiently will be the most successful. But much of the content on the machine can be reused from other instances when you’re customizing it. This helps companies reduce their cost while still getting what they want. Modular subsystems and components can be changed and reconfigured to customize the machine. The approach of creating modular machines offers the necessary agility to get the machine changed quickly. If you don’t have the modular approach, you'll have to do more engineering. It will cost you more and it may not serve your customers. DN: How big a factor is customization? Are all solutions custom when it comes to machine building? Rahul Garg: It’s not only becoming a factor, it’s a way of doing business. We create payload machines for certain jobs. Some machines are sold to job shops doing business for other clients. In many cases, you need to tailor the machiner for specific tasks. You have to get the speed and performance right for the job. When you’re creating a potato-bagging machine, you can image potato chips in all different sizes while also creating the need for air. It’s all part of what gets programmed into the machine. It requires customization depending on how the customer wants to differentiate its production system. DN: Are augmented reality and virtual reality becoming major factors in training? Or are they minor elements? Rahul Garg: It’s important to know the difference between AR and VR. AR is getting more traction because of COVID-19. Engineers who needed to go to sites were not traveling. Foods needed to be bagged, and if there was a problem with the machine, and the machine is from Norway and it’s deployed in Brazil, the field engineer can’t travel. AR systems allowed the engineers to get the data on a real-time basis to do the maintenance and repair and solve customer problems. The field engineer at the home office using augmented reality can usually serve customers better than making a trip halfway around the world.

The personnel chosen by Mr. Biden for the committee will determine U.S. strategy on AI policy not only for the administration but also to shape AI competition with China and other adversaries for years to come. The federal government is recruiting candidates for the committee and submitted a formal call for nominations in the Federal Register last week. TOP STORIES Republican points to 'leaked' Biden call, accuses administration of 'manipulating' Taliban intel 'No SALT, no deal': Vulnerable Dems threaten revolt unless $3.5T bill cuts blue-states taxes CNN poll: America turns irate, glum “AI presents an enormous opportunity to tackle the biggest issues of our time, strengthen our technological competitiveness, and be an engine for growth in nearly every sector of the economy,” said Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo in a statement. “But we must be thoughtful, creative, and wise in how we address the challenges that accompany these new technologies. She said that approach “includes, but is not limited to, ensuring that President Biden’s comprehensive commitment to advancing equity and racial justice extends to our development and use of AI technology.” The idea for the committee was created in a proposal during then-President Trump’s tenure, but became law through Congress’ overriding Mr. Trump’s veto of a 2021 defense bill. The priorities and emphasis of the committee under Mr. Biden are likely to look different than under Mr. Trump. White House science adviser Eric Lander said new AI capabilities must be matched by the government’s ability to provide fairness. “We must be sure that these [artificial intelligence] advances are matched by similar progress in ensuring that AI is trustworthy, and that it ensures fairness and protections for civil rights,” said Mr. Lander in a statement. During the Trump administration, the federal government convened a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence authorized through a 2018 defense bill. The commission issued a final report earlier this year to Congress that recommended spending billions of taxpayer dollars to foster AI innovation. The commission, led by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, is set to expire later this year. The new committee set to be staffed by Mr. Biden promises to focus on a wider range of issues. According to the government’s notice in the federal register, the committee will be tasked with giving Mr. Biden guidance on such things as how to prepare the American workforce for the “integration of artificial intelligence systems across all sectors of the economy and society.” Nominations for personnel to serve on the committee must be submitted to the National Institute for Standards and Technology by 5 p.m. Eastern time on Oct. 25.

The five-year, five-year breakeven inflation forward, a long-term market inflation gauge tracked by the ECB, rose to 1.8207%, its highest level since mid-2015 and a step closer to the ECB's new 2% inflation target. 16h ago Barrons.com MGM Resorts Rises, Virgin Galactic Falls — And What Else Is Happening in the Stock Market Monday Stocks were set for a higher open as a capital-gains tax proposal from House Democrats called for a smaller increase than expected and investors were buying last week’s dip. 13h ago More Stories",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The predictive accuracy of the new tool was comparable to that of video analysis that uses motor tasks to detect Parkinson’s, pinpointing facial expressions as a potential digital, diagnostic biomarker of the disease. This type of biomarker could allow remote diagnosis without the need for personal interaction and extensive testing. This would be particularly relevant in situations such as a pandemic, in cases of reduced mobility, or in underdeveloped countries where few neurologists exist but most people have access to a phone with a camera, researchers noted. The study, “ Facial expressions can detect Parkinson’s disease: preliminary evidence from videos collected online ,” was published as a brief communication in the journal npj Digital Medicine . Parkinson’s-associated motor symptoms, such as tremors and muscular rigidity, affect facial muscle movements, leading to overall reduced facial expression, also known as facial masking or hypomimia. Recommended Reading April 22, 2021 Columns by Lori DePorter The Many Masks We Wear With Parkinson’s Disease An increasing number of studies suggest that reduced facial expressions may be an “extremely sensitive biomarker for [Parkinson’s disease], making it a promising tool for early diagnosis,” the researchers wrote. In addition, facial expression analysis is a non-invasive tool that only requires a webcam or a phone with a camera, in contrast to the expensive, non-scalable, wearable sensors currently used to analyze movements during motor tasks as digital biomarkers of Parkinson’s. Now, a team of researchers at the University of Rochester, New York, showed that analyses of facial micro-expressions using an AI tool can accurately detect Parkinson’s. The study involved the analysis of 1,812 videos, collected online through a web-based tool (Park test) , of 604 people (61 with Parkinson’s and 543 without the disease). In these videos, participants were asked to make three facial expressions — a smiling, disgusted, and surprised face — each followed by a neutral face. Participants’ mean age was 63.9 years, and most of them were white and living in the U.S. Patients with Parkinson’s had been living with a diagnosis of the disease for a mean of 8.4 years. Changes in muscle movements in each of the three facial expressions were objectively measured and computed in terms of nine action units, or micro-expressions. In agreement with previous research, the analysis showed that Parkinson’s patients had fewer facial muscle movements than people without the disease. This was particularly significant for three micro-expressions: raising cheeks and pulling the lip corner — typically observed when people smile — and lowering the brows, usually seen when people express a disgusted face. According to the team, “the smiling facial expression has the greatest potential in differentiating individuals with and without” Parkinson’s, the researchers wrote. The team then used these differences in micro-expressions to train a machine learning tool to distinguish between individuals with and without Parkinson’s. Machine learning is a form of AI that uses algorithms to analyze data, learn from its analyses, and then make a prediction about something. They found that their AI tool could correctly identify Parkinson’s patients based on their facial expressions with an accuracy of 95.6%, which is comparable to the 92% prediction accuracy reported for existing state-of-the-art video analysis that relies on limb movements. “We show that an algorithm’s ability to analyze the subtle characteristics of facial expressions, often invisible to a naked eye, adds significant new information to a neurologist,” the team wrote. As such, facial expressions, especially smiling, “may become a reliable biomarker for [Parkinson’s disease] detection,” they added. Recommended Reading March 22, 2021 News by Forest Ray PhD Facial Recognition Program IDs Parkinson’s Patients as Older, Expressionless This type of diagnostic biomarker does not require in-person examination and diagnosis, which may be “potentially transformative for patients need of remote diagnoses due to physical separation (e.g., due to COVID) or immobility,” the team wrote. In addition, “many underdeveloped areas and underrepresented populations can also benefit from such method that utilizes facial expressions without worrying about direct access to a neurologist,” the researchers added. They noted that in 23 African countries, the mean population per neurologist exceeds half a million, but about 75% of people in Africa have access to a mobile phone, and that similar situations exist in Asia and South America. Moreover, the authors hypothesized the potential value of an app, that, with the user’s permission, could automatically analyze the micro-expressions of the user’s smile (from a short video) and provide a referral in case there were signs of Parkinson’s risk.

Watch Out for These 5 Artificial Intelligence Problems in HR Artificial Intelligence (AI) can truly relieve some of the hiring and evaluation burdens of HR. But, there are several areas where it's just not ready to take the place of actual humans. By John Boitnott September 						13, 2021 Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own. You're reading Entrepreneur United States, an international franchise of Entrepreneur Media. Artificial intelligence (AI) might be the way of the future in tech, gaming and smart-device industries. When applied effectively, AI can save on human employment costs and, in some cases, can accomplish tasks even better than humans can. It would make sense for other industries to try to capitalize on AI’s efficiency , versatility and overall power, but for entrepreneurs, applying AI to human resources (HR) poses some challenges. Related: Hire Your Next Remote Team Member from One of These 20 U.S. Tech Hubs Understanding AI and the challenges it creates in HR departments HR professionals may want to put AI to use, at least partly because it can offer predictive analysis for recruiting. When a company is swamped with resumes, AI can scan resumes for those that best fit the skills and responsibilities required for that specific job. In this sense, AI can save HR teams days of sifting through resumes and cover letters. But applying AI to HR departments isn’t always that simple, and in many cases AI can create more challenges than the problems that it solves. Here are some of those issues, and how you can deal with them. 1. AI won’t understand your company like you or a recruiter can Although AI might help recruiters quickly scan through a pile of resumes, it lacks the global understanding of a company that recruiters possess. When hiring ideal employees, a recruiter researches a company and develops an understanding of that company’s positioning, direction within the market and even company culture. AI lacks that same understanding, so when it comes to identifying employees who might be a good fit given the wider global view of the company, AI technology falls short. AI also lacks the knowledge and intuition that recruiters develop from decades in their jobs. AI won’t necessarily spot important connections in an applicant’s past work that might hint that applicant could be an important candidate. For instance, a recruiter might see that an applicant has worked for a company that underwent rapid growth in the past. That could mean the applicant might be comfortable and flexible enough to grow with a quickly expanding startup. AI won’t make that same connection. Related: Could This Robot Actually Be Your Marketing Writer? The key here is to consider mixing these solutions, so you receive the benefits of both. For example, you can use AI to help candidates more easily send you their credentials (automatic web forms and the like), but use recruiters and your own experience to narrow down the applicants who may actually be the best fit. 2. You might miss out on hiring outliers Job applicants who don’t fit all of the strict hiring criteria a company has established might also be overlooked by HR. Some of these outliers could make a strong contribution to a company but might not get an interview because of AI technology used to screen resumes. Similarly, because AI lacks a human touch, it might approve resumes of applicants who meet all of the required criteria, but who still aren’t ideal applicants for a position. Although it’s smart to use AI to cast a wide net, watch the process closely to keep an eye out for certain characteristics that you want in a new hire. If necessary, schedule time for you and your team to personally assess any candidate if needed. Related: Nervous About Meeting Employees in Person for the First Time? Try These 5 Tips 3.  AI can’t account for human emotion When hiring, companies don’t base their decision-making process on only hard skills. Emotional and psychological traits are important, too, including ambition and passion. AI cannot currently monitor or evaluate human emotion, and it can’t account for how emotion affects human behavior. AI also cannot account for personalities and how emotion can affect teams. If tasked with finding a new team member to add to an existing team, AI can’t recognize the nuances of team dynamics and how personalities work together. That’s where you and the team come in. Because AI operates without the background understanding of complex human emotions, it makes for a flawed hiring and employee evaluation process. Use it sparingly for actual employee evaluation, and let team members do that themselves. 4. AI can’t ‘read’ people HR is a human-based, personal operation. AI can’t replace an individual manager’s unique viewpoint or ability to “read” people in person, whether they’re job applicants or current employees. Although companies might incorporate AI solutions into their business models, the technology isn’t ready to take over significant face-to-face responsibilities in an HR department just yet. As mentioned, the technology might be useful in resume screenings, but it needs to be monitored closely and can’t replace talent evaluators (no matter what Elon Musk's plans are). Related: 3 Ways to Set Up Personal and Business Success During Immense Change 5. AI lacks ethical responsibility Ethical responsibility is key for HR teams today, especially when it comes to hiring minorities, taking action after sexual assault and other hot-button issues. AI lacks the ethical responsibility that HR needs to uphold, and AI can unknowingly become biased , too. AI technology “learns” from the algorithms that it processes. If AI’s machine learning process is programmed by a human, it can take on the biases of its programmer, even though he or she might be unaware of their biases. With biased technology, a company’s talent acquisition process might unintentionally also be biased. If the hiring process is ever challenged or questioned, the technology cannot be held accountable for the bias, so HR leaders and the HR team need to take on ethical responsibility. In order to prevent or remedy these occurrences, HR pros have to communicate about such problems to company leadership and programmers. Then, different departments should work together to identify bias, and prevent it from influencing hiring processes. On another ethical note, if AI can replace a certain number of workers at a company, HR might face the challenging question of deciding which employees to let go. AI might save a company money, but replacing employees with technology can be a touchy ethical dilemma. Also, certain AI tech can help by actually picking which people to lay off. Discuss whether these types of solutions feel ethically right to you and your team or not. Just who will select the technology, who needs to be retrained or who might be fired in the end? Go carefully and thoughtfully as you deal with AI and how it affects all of these matters.

Using the AI software, all organizations, from large enterprises to small businesses and schools to health care providers, can fully verify, track and manage vaccinations to prevent, control and mitigate Covid-19 in the workplace. Employees of these institutions no longer need to fear Covid-19 and can now safely return to work and live life as it was meant to be. Even with tremendous progress in vaccinations, an unbiased examination of the data will reveal that there is still much reason to fear in the here and now. There are more weekly infections now than at any other time since the start of the pandemic, excepting the peak period of Dec and Jan. As travel and mask restrictions are removed, newer and more deadly strains are popping up. Studies based on scientific research have shown that no amount of hygiene theater or workplace re-engineering can fully prevent the airborne transmission of Covid-19, particularly in indoor spaces. There is certainly a risk of contagion indoors and the valid concerns of workers about workplace safety is not being heard. Below citations are from just two of many such studies: Study I: https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/71/9/2311/5867798 Study II: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-16/covid-is-airborne-scientists-say-now-authorities-think-so-too Qare Inc. saw this coming and put data/smarts to work. Qare's AI solution ASGARD™ automatically collects and processes consent-based employee health data from smart health cards to verify vaccination and track Covid-19 risk dynamically at each location with pinpoint accuracy. And prevention and control measures can be initiated in real-time with highly granular access control measures. Says Kate Beckett , an early Beta customer from a midsize business, ""It's the new silver bullet, the next best thing since the vaccine. So now, we can be sure of an infection free work environment, instead of merely wishing or hoping for one"". Just as President Joe Biden is unveiling new vaccine mandates to combat Covid-19 and save lives, Qare Inc. has come up with the perfect new advanced AI solution to implement it. Qare's ASGARD™ can verify, track, monitor and manage vaccinations automatically with a touch-free workflow as well as intelligently control risks and mitigate vulnerabilities. However, this tool was not opportunely conceived overnight, but is a product of meticulous research and development for well over a year.

This working group will specifically be dedicated to supporting cancer prevention research. Raymond N. DuBois, M.D., Ph.D. , director of MUSC Hollings Cancer Center and dean of the College of Medicine at the Medical University of South Carolina, is one of the 28 members appointed to the group. A dedicated advocate for the promotion and support of cancer prevention, DuBois said he’s excited to serve on this working group as part of a prestigious team of members serving from across the nation, Canada and Europe. The mission of the AACR Cancer Prevention Working Group is to establish cancer prevention as a global priority through innovative science, integration of the latest technologies, improved levels of funding and delivery of effective public education and awareness strategies. “This is an important part of the mission of Hollings and of our Cancer Control Program. I applaud the formation of this group and the priority it sets in shifting more of the focus to cancer prevention,” said DuBois, who also serves as an editor-in-chief of the AACR Cancer Prevention Research journal. The AACR Cancer Prevention Working Group will provide a forum for communication and collaboration among basic, translational and clinical scientists; physicians, nurses and other health care providers; and cancer prevention experts in academia, industry and government. The members of the working group will work together to facilitate basic, translational and clinical transdisciplinary research aimed at promoting the understanding of cancer prevention science. The AACR Cancer Prevention Working Group will strive to accomplish its mission by: Fostering transdisciplinary approaches to the study of cancer prevention. Promoting the incorporation of molecular and biochemical concepts and techniques as well as novel data science tools into well-designed cancer prevention studies. Providing an ongoing forum for the scholarly discussion and development of effective approaches to the conduct and interpretation of cancer prevention studies. Fostering collaborations with individuals and with relevant AACR scientific working groups engaged in other scientific disciplines. Recommending scientific and educational programs that will serve to advance the field. Assisting with the professional advancement of early- and mid-career investigators engaged in cancer prevention research. Establishing a community of cancer prevention experts and additional individuals interested in advancing progress in cancer prevention. Margaret Foti, M.D., Ph.D., chief executive officer of the AACR, said that following the inception of the AACR’s Molecular Epidemiology Working Group in 1999, the number of their scientific working groups has continued to expand to meet the needs of the cancer research community. “We are now proud to announce this working group dedicated to the vital area of cancer prevention research. The field of cancer prevention has been an area richly supported by the AACR since the organization’s founding in 1907, with the leadership of several AACR past presidents. This new working group will ensure that the AACR remains at the leading edge of scientific advancements in cancer prevention, early detection and interception.” For a complete list of all the members of the working group, visit the AACR website .

Keeping these machines at peak health is critical as wear-and-tear is inevitable. However forecasting and predicting maintenance is not straight-forward and varies from one indutry to another. To effectively schedule maintenance, it is necessary to predict how a detected abnormal condition is likely to develop in the future. Only then can valuable insight into the probable future consequences be gained The hybrid approach being used by ABB combines machine learning (ML) models and Failure Modes and Effect Analysis (FMEA) to provide accurate information about actual asset health. Successful predictive maintenance requires a three-pronged process: • Condition monitoring that can provide early detection of faults • Identification of specific failure mode(s) related to the fault detection • Quantification of the extent of fault development to support maintenance planning Despite the availability of various popular ML approaches to develop models for asset condition, eg, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Local Outlier Factor (LOF), One Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM), ML approaches are black box approaches and fully dependant on asset data; they make no assumptions about the asset or its failure modes. Practical industrial experiences indicate that such approaches are not always successful and often lead to several types of false positives and false negatives. Raising an alarm when the asset is completely healthy or vice versa increases unplanned costs. Related articles Dutch predictive maintenance startup sees €5m backing Predictive maintenance with cloud-connected sensor kit Sensor data, ML powers AWS custom predictive maintenance ABB’s hybrid approach relies on historical data and engineering models of an asset to enable the implementation of predictive maintenance. The online condition monitoring data is combined with data science uses one of two techniques, either detection of anomalies where online measurements deviate from normal operating behaviour or the identification of known failure characteristics where online measurements closely match a “fault signature” Both techniques use a data model: the former represents “good health” and the latter captures the “data signature” present under fault conditions. The former is often the best approach to use because there is almost always sufficient historical data available that represents good health. This health data enables the model to be trained. Conversely, there is usually no- or insufficient data available to represent all possible failure conditions. The second model also relies on equipment characteristics, and these depend on the installation and operating conditions. This means the data that relates to a specific machine is usually insufficient to train an accurate fault model. With the hybrid approach, an engineering model is used to quantify the extent of the deviation of the online measurements from the health model. A Failure Mode Analysis model is used. FMEA is a core component of Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) programs that already exist for the most commonly encountered equipment and systems. It defines the potential detection and identification of a fault.

It offers countless solutions across all industries. Artificial intelligence is a major market player in the business world. AI plays a key role in data analysis, marketing, finance, business, advertising, medicine, technology, science and engineering where machines are learning from stimuli and reacting in ways more human than ever before. Artificial intelligence has several advantages and disadvantages, so it's important to know how to use it to maximize its potential within your organization. What Exactly is Artificial Intelligence and Its Subsets? Artificial intelligence is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence displayed by humans or animals. It applies to computing systems designed to perform tasks usually reserved for human intelligence using logic, if-then rules, and decision trees. AI recognizes patterns from vast amounts of quality data providing insights, predicting outcomes, and making complex decisions. Over the past few years, more and more companies have been experimenting with AI, advancing their data-related capabilities, acquiring new technologies and talent, and integrating AI into their business processes. In coming years, AI will likely become even more pervasive. Just as we no longer talk about isolated mobile strategies (they’re just part of doing business), AI will soon become standard and routine—maybe even faster than we expect. Here are 4 of its most popular subsets: Machine learning (ML): With machine learning technologies, computers can be taught to analyze data, identify hidden patterns, make classifications, and predict future outcomes. Deep learning (DL): Deep learning is a subset of machine learning based upon a conceptual model of the human brain called “neural networks.” It’s called deep learning because the neural networks have multiple layers that interconnect. Natural language processing (NL): Natural language processing is the ability to extract or generate meaning and intent from text in a readable, stylistically natural, and grammatically correct form. Computer vision (CV): Computer vision is the ability to extract meaning and intent from visual elements, whether characters (in the case of document digitization) or the categorization of content in images, such as faces, objects, scenes, and activities. Artificial intelligence has many advantages, but also disadvantages, and everything will depend on how AI will be used or misused. Artificial intelligence has massive potential for creating a better world to live in. The most important role for humans will be to ensure that the rise of the AI doesn’t get out of hand. What Are The Advantages of Artificial Intelligence? 1) Less Human Errors: There is less room for error with artificial intelligence. 2) Doing More Complex Tasks: Artificial intelligence can perform a more laborious task with extra hard work and with greater responsibility. 3) Available 24/7: Educational Institutes and Helpline centers are getting many queries and issues which can be handled effectively using AI. 4) Providing Digital Assistance: Virtual assistants inside smartphones, PCs, or connected home speakers, like Apple’s Siri, Microsoft’s Cortana, Google’s Google Now, Samsung’s Galaxy S8’s Bixby and Amazon’s Alexa, provide contextual information. 5) Assisting Humans in Repetitive Tasks: In banks, we often see many verifications of documents to get a loan which is a repetitive task for the owner of the bank. Using AI Cognitive Automation the owner can speed up the process of verifying the documents by which both the customers and the owner will be benefited. 6) More Productive : Emotions are not associated with artificial intelligence robots and therefore the mood doesn’t hamper the efficiency. Thus they are always productive. 7) Educating The Next Generation: Nowadays, medical professionals are trained with artificial surgery simulators. It uses applications which help in detecting and monitoring neurological disorders and stimulate the brain functions. 8) Right Decision Making: The integration of AI tools in the business world has improved the efficiency of organizations. What Are The Disadvantages of Artificial Intelligence? 1) It's An Expensive Technology: It’s true that artificial intelligence comes with a high cost, but there is no such thing as a free lunch either. It requires huge costs as it is a complex machine. Apart from the installation cost, its repair and maintenance also require huge costs. 2) Lack of Emotion and Moral Values: No matter how smart a machine becomes, it can never replicate a human. Machines are rational but very inhuman as they don’t possess emotions and moral values. They don’t know what is ethical and what’s legal and because of this, don’t have their own judgment making skills. 3) No Feelings: Artificial intelligence doesn’t have feelings and because of which there is nothing like working with a whole heart or with full passion for them. There is no sense of belonging or togetherness or a human touch. 4) Still Not Creative Enough: The current artificial intelligence is still narrow and isn't creative. They can only do what they are being taught or commanded. Though they help in designing and creating, they can’t match the power of a human brain. 5) Destroying Jobs: If in the future, human beings don’t add to their skills, then in no time, we can see that they will be replaced with machines. 6) Relying Too Much on AI Leads To Addiction : As we rely on machines to make everyday tasks more efficient, we risk technology addiction. 7) Making Humans Feel Lazy: Artificial intelligence applications automate the majority of tedious and repetitive tasks. Since we do not have to memorize things or solve puzzles to get the job done, we tend to use our brains less and less. This addiction to AI can cause problems to future generations. 8) No Ethics: Ethics and morality are important human features that can be difficult to incorporate into an AI. The rapid progress of AI has raised a number of concerns that one day, AI will grow uncontrollably, and eventually wipe out humanity. This moment is referred to as the AI singularity. How To Use Artificial Intelligence in Your Business? Businesses can use artificial intelligence to simplify the work of their employees in the following ways: Automated insights Spam filters Email categorisation Voice to text features Automated responders and online customer support Process automation Sales and Business forecasting Cybecurity surveillance Fraud detection and prevention for online transactions Dynamic price optimisation What Are the Most Popular Applications of Artificial Intelligence? There are a vast number of things that artificial intelligence can do on a daily basis: Interpreting video feeds from drones carrying out visual inspections of infrastructure such as oil pipelines. Organizing personal and business calendars. Detecting fake news. Identifying audios, videos and images Classifying objects to avoid collisions and a better navigation experience Preventing cybersecurity attacks Responding to simple customer-service queries. Improving internet of things devices. Coordinating with other intelligent systems to carry out tasks like booking a hotel at a suitable time and location. Reporting faulty products. Assisting financial services organizations with high frequency trading Helping radiologists to spot potential tumors in X-rays. Speeding up production. Flagging inappropriate content online, detecting wear and tear in elevators from data gathered by IoT devices. Generating a 3D model of the world from satellite imagery. Why Should Your Organization Invest in Artificial Intelligence in the Near Future? Why Do More Companies Invest in Artificial Intelligence? Many business executives are thinking about AI in terms of cost savings and efficiency. Organizations also invest in many artificial intelligence solutions to enhance their IT department, cybersecurity, production, manufacturing, engineering, construction and product development. Business functions such as marketing, human resources, legal, and procurement can also be enhanced thanks to artificial intelligence. Automate a process or function that would normally be done by a human —for example, automating back-end operations, managing cloud and IT networks, or detecting patterns in video Optimize the efficiency of a process or function —for example, preventing fraud, identifying defective products, finding errors in software code, or personalizing advertising placement Enhance the ability of individuals to accomplish tasks or enable them to do something they typically could not —for example, forecasting demand, improving compliance, augmenting threat detection by security analysts, diagnosing a patient, identifying a problem with a mechanical system, or drawing out new customer insights How To Strike The Right Equilibrium With Artificial Intelligence? Over the past few years, more and more companies have been experimenting with AI, advancing their data-related capabilities, acquiring new technologies and talent, and integrating AI into their business processes. In coming years, AI will likely become even more pervasive. Just as we no longer talk about isolated mobile strategies (they’re just part of doing business), AI will soon become standard and routine—maybe even faster than we expect. As a result, companies that already have an AI-powered edge should continue differentiating themselves. Companies that haven’t yet adopted AI technologies should begin to accelerate efforts across their products, processes, and talent. As late entrants begin to catch up with industry leaders, AI adopters should consider focusing on three actions to maintain their edge (see figure 3): Pursue creative approaches: unlocking value beyond efficiency and becoming more creative with their AI applications, balancing evolution and transformation Become a smarter consumer: with more AI vendors, platforms, and technologies available, becoming better at evaluating buying options Actively address risks: not allowing the perceived risks of AI to derail efforts by becoming more conscientious about how AI gets used, and by building trust with customers and partners Conclusion Whether we realize it or not, artificial intelligence is all around us and playing an active role in our daily lives. Every business and every professional should carefully evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of artificial intelligence . It has served us pretty well and has made life easier in various ways, but it's important to strike the right balance.

David Thompson Sep 13, 2021 02:17 PM EDT Facebook Twitter Linkedin Comment Mail Close (Photo : Photo by Mikael Blomkvist from Pexels) Is Artificial Intelligence the future of CRM? Artificial intelligence is quickly becoming a hot topic, but what does it have to do with CRM? The answer may surprise you. AI is the future of customer service and will change how we interact with customers in the next few years. It's no longer an option for businesses that want to stay competitive. Companies are investing heavily in AI because they see that it has potential for increased productivity, better quality work, and reduced costs. The Benefits of Combining Artificial Intelligence with CRM List of benefits. Number one benefit is first bolded, followed by bullet points for the other three benefits. Increased productivity AI allows employees to spend more time focusing on value-added activities while customer relationship management system chatbots handle repetitive tasks like answering FAQs and helping customers with problems that are easy to solve (for example, ""I forgot my password""). Better quality work Replacing human interactions with artificial intelligence can improve the overall experience for businesses and their clients because it removes any frustration or confusion caused by miscommunications between employees and customers. For example, suppose a live agent is dealing with multiple chats at once. In that case, they may not be able to answer questions as thoroughly as an automated bot would be able to simply by virtue of having more time to devote to each inquiry. Reduced costs Implementing AI into customer service is a lot cheaper than hiring new employees or outsourcing agents, saving businesses money in the long run. Accurate Client Insights Through Artificial Intelligence Artificial intelligence is also useful for giving businesses actionable insights about their customers. AI can gather data and analyze it to give companies a better idea of what works, what doesn't work, and how they should progress in the future, all while doing it faster than humans could ever hope to accomplish on their own. Ai Within Marketing Artificial intelligence isn't just useful for customer service; it can also be used to help marketing teams gather insights and make better decisions. For example, AI could monitor a company's social media presence and determine which posts are the most impactful so that marketers know what content is worth producing more of in the future. AI will bring about drastic changes within the next few years as companies begin adopting this new technology into their existing strategies. The time to start thinking about how you're going to implement artificial intelligence into your own business practices is now; otherwise, you'll fall behind when all of your competitors have already achieved greater success than they were able to before due to increased productivity, improved quality work, and reduced costs thanks in part to AI integration. How To Integrate Artificial Intelligence Into CRM? List step-by-step instructions on different ways you can integrate artificial intelligence into CRM without having an advanced degree in computer science or being a developer yourself. There are several options when deciding whether or not your business wants to implement artificial intelligence into its customer service operations: Build your own chatbot from scratch using third-party tools like Chatfuel. Use prebuilt chatbots like ManyChat. Use a CRM platform that comes with built-in AI features such as Salesforce. While the first two options are good for businesses on a budget, using an entire system designed to help you work smarter is likely your best bet. Conclusion It's clear that artificial intelligence will play an increasingly important role for companies of all sizes in the coming years, especially when it comes to customer service and CRM systems. Although chatbots can't replace live agents entirely yet (at least not without sacrificing some benefits), they are becoming extremely sophisticated every day, so we expect this trend to continue growing at breakneck speed over the next few decades.

By Laura Lovett September 13, 2021 11:50 am Share Photo: Longhua Liao/Getty Images With an eye on the oncology space, Israeli startup Medial EarlySign has inked a deal with pharma giant Roche Diagnostics International to commercialize an artificial intelligence tool that helps detect cancer early. As part of the collaboration agreement, the pair will develop, clinically validate and then commercialize the product. Initially the companies will focus on the gastric cancer space. The clinical decision support tool will use EarlySign’s software that incorporates lab results, EHR data and other clinical care. WHY IT MATTERS According to the American Cancer Society , stomach cancer accounts for roughly 1.5% of all new cancers diagnosed in the U.S. In fact, in 2021 the society estimates that there are 25,560 new cases of gastric cancer, and 11,180 deaths associated with the condition. The companies are pitching this new deal as a way to help catch gastric cancer early. The pair note that the condition often develops slowly and goes undetected for some time. ""Our next steps are to help bring new diagnostics methodologies to the global market through better management and utilization of vast amounts of data in ways that were previously unimaginable,” Ori Geva, CEO and cofounder of EarlySign, said in a statement. “By coupling our proven machine learning infrastructure and data science expertise with the global leadership of Roche, we are looking forward to bringing forth a new class of predictive tools to make a significant contribution to improve human health."" THE LARGER TREND This isn’t the first partnership for Medial EarlySign. In March, the company signed a deal with Datos Health in order to offer an integrated platform that pinpoints high-risk patients who could benefit from remote care. Medial EarlySign has a history of working in the oncology space. A 2018 study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology CCI found the company’s AI tool flagged 8% of patients in a large trial group that were later diagnosed with cancer or precancerous lesions. Roche Diagnostics has also been interested in the digital health space for some time. In 2020, the company teamed up with investment firm aMoon to launch an early-stage investment program dubbed StarFinder Lab that is focused on novel diagnostic technologies, and AI data analysis and digital health in particular.

(Getty Images) After penning a major funding round earlier this year, the artificial intelligence-powered drug designer Exscientia is showing no signs of slowing down, with the announcement of plans to go public. The Oxford, U.K.-based developer confidentially filed for a $100 million Nasdaq IPO in late June, shortly after posting a $225 million series D that could include an additional $300 million in equity. The offering's exact pricing terms have not yet been disclosed, according to Renaissance Capital , and could climb higher. Those proceeds will come alongside a recent $35 million equity investment from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which will support at least five small molecules aimed at COVID-19, influenza and other viruses that may spur the next global pandemic. Exscientia is set to provide matching funds for the effort. The company’s pipeline is spearheaded by three AI-designed drug candidates that have begun phase 1 clinical trials, including one immuno-oncology agent for solid tumors in partnership with Evotec and two psychiatry-focused assets being co-developed with Sumitomo Dainippon. RELATED: SoftBank leads funding that could net up to $525M for Exscientia's AI drug platform Behind them are more than 25 active projects in cancer, inflammation and rare diseases, Exscientia said in its prospectus , including four potential drugs lined up for IND submissions with biopharma partners such as Bristol Myers Squibb and Aperion Biologics. Using its AI programs to speed up design and discovery work, Exscientia claims it can cut the total amount of time needed by 70%—its most advanced programs have reportedly gone from target identification to candidate selection in less than 18 months, down from the industry average of four-and-a-half years. That pitch attracted the attention of SoftBank this past April, with its Vision Fund 2 leading the company’s $225 million series D round. That fundraising also included the international conglomerate's commitment to an additional $300 million in equity funding, available for Exscientia to tap at its discretion. RELATED: Bristol Myers' $1.2B discovery pact with Exscientia strikes gold as first drug candidate selected Since then, Exscientia collected a $20 million payout in its $1.2 billion drug design partnership with BMS after landing on an immune-system modulating candidate while chasing a previously hard-to-hit target. BMS has in-licensed the drug and is set to take command of its clinical and commercial development. This past summer also saw Exscientia spend some of its haul on the $60 million acquisition of Allcyte , an Austrian AI developer looking to predict how well cancer therapies perform in individual patients. Exscientia also inked a collaboration with EQRx to find low-cost options for cancer treatments. Meanwhile, Exscientia’s contemporaries in AI-powered drug discovery have also seen their wallets swell: Recursion posted a $436 million IPO on the heels of a $239 million series D, while insitro and Insilico Medicine have collected $400 million and $255 million rounds, respectively.

A new dashboard , launched today by the Johns Hopkins Center for Communication Programs , unpacks that survey data to help explain why—and how experts can work to increase acceptance rates. The researchers found that the primary reasons around the world for resisting vaccination include fears about side effects, a desire to wait until more people have had the shots so they know they are safe, and a lack of confidence in whether the vaccine really works. ""Our analysis of this large trove of data finds that while vaccine hesitancy is real, there are many people around the globe who can be encouraged to get their doses—if public health officials can build and share their messages to address their concerns."" Dominick Shattuck Johns Hopkins Center for Communication Programs These latest survey results, based on responses gathered between Aug. 16 and 31, can be found in the new COVID Behaviors dashboard , an interactive tool created with data collected from more than 12 million people from 115 countries. The survey—believed to be the world's largest daily survey of global COVID knowledge, attitudes, and practices—has been fielded every day since May 20, 2021. It is expected to continue until the end of this year, and new data will become available every two weeks. The dashboard is intended to be used by policymakers, government officials, and public health practitioners at national and sub-national levels to better understand the behavioral drivers behind vaccine uptake, masking, and physical distancing that can prevent the spread of COVID-19. ""Our analysis of this large trove of data finds that while vaccine hesitancy is real, there are many people around the globe who can be encouraged to get their doses—if public health officials can build and share their messages to address their concerns,"" says Dominick Shattuck, CCP's director of monitoring evaluation and learning and one of the leaders of the COVID behaviors project. Adds Marla Shaivitz, CCP's director of digital strategy: ""The dashboard can be used as a roadmap for policymakers to identify and engage with citizens to encourage them to be vaccinated to protect themselves and their families from COVID-19. In many countries, this dashboard fills an important data gap. It offers the most comprehensive data some governments have access to on how COVID behaviors are changing and what they can do to intervene."" The dashboard is the product of a collaboration among CCP, the World Health Organization's Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, and Facebook. The data are generated from the COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey, which is administered in the United States by the Delphi Group at Carnegie Mellon University and in other countries by the University of Maryland Social Data Science Center . The two universities collect the survey data from a random sample of Facebook users and CCP analyzes the responses. A previous COVID behaviors dashboard, also led by CCP, was based on smaller, less frequent surveys from June 2020 through March 2021. Image caption: A woman works in a face mask manufacturing shop in a factory in Harare, Zimbabwe. Image credit :  International Labour Organization In this latest survey, reasons for vaccine hesitancy vary by country. In Senegal, the two most common reasons for hesitancy are concerns about side effects and whether the vaccine will work. Education around vaccine science and side effects could work to encourage vaccine uptake in Senegal. In the Netherlands, however, unvaccinated respondents were most likely to say that they don't believe they need a vaccine. When asked why not, their main reasons were because they are not a member of a high-risk group, or they don't believe COVID-19 is a serious illness. Each underlying perception requires a different messaging response. The dashboard sheds light on how other behaviors have evolved over the last four months as well. In the United States, for example, 65% of those who responded to the survey between Aug. 16 and 31 said they had been shopping indoors in the previous 24 hours, and two-thirds those who had been shopping said they wore masks. Mask wearing steadily decreased in the U.S. until the middle of July but has been rising since the highly transmissible Delta variant became the dominant strain, and case counts and hospitalizations began rising again to record levels in many states. In India, where an outbreak has fallen from its May peak, only 29% of respondents had been shopping indoors in the previous 24 hours and the vast majority of them (87%) were wearing masks, suggesting there is a long way to go before things get back to normal. Since March 2020, a staggering 223 million COVID cases—and 4.6 million deaths—have been reported around the world, according to Johns Hopkins University's COVID-19 dashboard . More than 5.3 billion vaccine doses have been administered globally, though just over 2% of those doses have been administered in Africa. USAID has sent more than 110 million doses to low- and middle-income countries and COVAX, a worldwide initiative aimed at equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines, has distributed more than 236 million doses. As vaccine access increases, governments will need to develop strategies to sensitize citizens to accurate information and the benefits of vaccines. In addition to findings about vaccine hesitancy, the dashboard also features data on why many people who want vaccines can't seem to access them. In Brazil, for example, where 65% of the unvaccinated respondents in the Aug. 16-31 survey period said they probably or definitely want a vaccine, 23% of those who want one said they couldn't get a shot because they are not eligible for one, and 34% said there were no appointments available. Armed with knowledge from the dashboard, officials in those countries can aim to work with local communities to make vaccine appointments more accessible—once vaccines are widely available—and to better spread the word about appointments that are available and when, where, and how to secure them. ""We are at a critical time for global COVID-19 vaccine rollouts, yet populations are oversaturated with information, disinformation, and rumors,"" says Jeni Stolow of WHO's Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network. ""Continuously producing timely evidence-based and effective health communication is a major challenge in this second year of the pandemic. This dashboard can support public health practitioners around the globe in their endeavors to tailor, target, and reinvigorate their local COVID-19 vaccine outreach efforts."" While many unvaccinated people around the world say they are unlikely to get vaccinated, in many countries, large percentages of the population say they would choose to get their children vaccinated once a vaccine becomes available. In India and Guatemala, well over 90% of survey respondents said they would definitely or probably vaccinate their children. Data from Aug. 16 through 31 show the figure was 86% in Mozambique, 72% in the United States, and 47% in Serbia. ""The volume of data that has and will continue to be collected on COVID-19 will be of great value to policymakers and health practitioners, if the data are strategically used,"" says Douglas Storey, CCP's director for communication science and research. ""This dashboard offers deep insights into behaviors around the world and will be a guide for those aiming to stop the spread of this devastating disease."" CCP will host a webinar about the new dashboard with experts from the center and WHO's Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network on Tuesday, Sept. 21, at 9:30 a.m. EST.

Photo by John Griffin Data science and artificial intelligence (AI) have become powerful tools for generating new knowledge, fueling innovation, and dealing with some of society’s most pressing problems. However, “big data” and machine learning tools can perpetuate biases that advantage some people, while disadvantaging others. Now, a new National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award of nearly $3 million will enable Stony Brook University to provide interdisciplinary cross-training to PhD students in the data sciences alongside PhD students in the human-centered sciences to detect and address biases in data, models, people, and institutions. This innovative five-year training project spans eight departments in Stony Brook’s College of Arts and Sciences (Departments of Psychology, Linguistics, Economics, Sociology, Political Science, and Neurobiology and Behavior) and the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences (Departments of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics and Statistics ). Human-centered scientists will master cutting-edge computational methods that empower their research; they will take bridge courses in computer science as well as data science graduate courses and will earn a graduate certificate in AI. Data science students will earn a certificate in the human-centered sciences; they will learn theories and practices within these disciplines including study designs, associated limitations, and ethical issues. Together, trainees from both tracks will collaborate on convergent research projects that unite deep disciplinary knowledge in human-centered sciences with techniques in data science and AI. They will develop strong identities as computational human-centered scientists capable of addressing the impacts of data-driven technology upon human beings and society. The project will fund qualifying trainees with NSF-level stipends of $34K and will also train non-funded trainees, including international students. It will be led by principal investigator Susan Brennan, Department of Psychology, with co-PIs C.R. Ramakrishnan, Department of Computer Science; Wei Zhu, Department of Applied Math and Statistics; Bonita London, Department of Psychology; and Jeffrey Heinz, Department of Linguistics. “Our science students tend to gather in distinct siloes, with much higher proportions of women in the human-centered sciences than in the data sciences,” said Brennan. “The lack of diversity in today’s AI workforce is concerning because addressing bias and solving hard societal problems demands bringing together different perspectives. We want our trainees to learn how to recognize and deal with bias where it can do harm.” Other SBU faculty participants and senior personnel (listed alphabetically by department) include Adryan Wallace (Departments of Africana Studies, Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies, and Political Science); H. Andrew Schwarz, Klaus Mueller, Niranjan Balasubramanian, and Steven Skiena of Computer Science; Marina Azzimonti (Economics); Mónica Bugallo (Electrical & Computer Engineering); Owen Rambow (Linguistics); Il Memming Park (Neurobiology and Behavior); Reuben Kline (Political Science); Christian Luhmann (Psychology); and Jason Jones (Sociology). Psychologist Catherine Good of Baruch College, CUNY will serve as Evaluator. The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The program is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary or convergent research areas through comprehensive traineeship models that are innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs.

But at eBay, optimizing the software to run on a particular piece of hardware using distillation and quantization techniques was absolutely essential to ensure scalability. eBay ’s head of machine learning and NLP Selcuk Kopru described how the company optimizes its machine learning models in support of its AI-driven marketplace in a presentation made earlier today at the AI Hardware Summit , a hybrid event that’s taking place virtually and at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California this week. “[I]n order to build a truly global marketplace that is driven by state of the art and powerful and scalable AI services,” Kopru said, “you have to do a lot of optimizations after model training, and specifically for the target hardware.” eBay certainly is no stranger to scale. With 1.5 billion active listings from more than 19 million active sellers trying to reach 159 million active buyers, the ecommerce giant has a global reach that is matched by only a handful of firms. Machine learning and other AI techniques, such as natural language processing (NLP), play big roles in scaling eBay’s operations to reach its massive audience. For instance, automatically generated descriptions of product listings is crucial for displaying information on the small screens of smart phones, Kopru said. eBay trains its version of the BERT transformer model using a 64 GPU system (image courtesy eBay) “The full item description is too big to display on mobile screen, and generation of a description summary is essential in this experience,” he said. “Feature extraction from product reviews, filtering of product reviews, shipping and delivery estimation, and payments and fraud detection in member-to-member communications – they are all benefiting from AI.” eBay uses a host of AI and ML techniques to glean insight from listings and other data that it possesses. That includes neural network-based transformer models, like BERT, GPT-2, and GPT-3, for inferring information from text, as well as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), a supervised machine learning algorithm, for image classification. For text understanding and summarization, eBay uses a custom version of the large BERT transformer model, called eBERT. As Kopru explained, the company starts by developing a similarity function that presents the titles of the product entries as vectors in a shared space. In his presentation at AI Hardware Summit, the product entry space was limited to two-dimensions. “Of course, real applications can increase to hundreds of dimensions,” he said. Finding the similarity between item titles helps in matching the listings to products in the catalog and can also be used to find duplicate products. “Having a clean catalog is very important in any ecommerce experience,” Kopru said. eBay trains eBERT on a cluster composed of 64 Nvidia V100 GPUs. According to Kopru, it takes two weeks to complete a round of training for the eBERT model. Because training eBERT is such an expensive task, the company takes pains to ensure eBay researchers and engineers can access the trained model in a very efficient way, with just a few lines of Python code. eBay uses a NUMA setup to speed neural inference for its eBERT model (image courtesy eBay) But because of its size, eBert is not suitable to use online for inferencing purposes. “You cannot just put it into production,” Kopru said. “Therefore, we use techniques like model distillation and quantization to improve the throughput of the models.” Distillation is a way to compress a model by using a smaller “student” model to match a large pre-trained “teacher” model. It includes specific techniques aimed at minimizing the loss of precision. Quantization, meanwhile, is a method used to execute some of a model’s operations on tensors with integers rather than floating point values. The accuracy tradeoff from using distillation and quantization are worth it to eBay, Kopru said. “We can train 3x faster models and 3x more throughput can be achieved by giving up 3% of the accuracy,” he said. “This tradeoff is a good one based on the results we are getting. We are willing to continue to do that.” While eBay does all of its deep learning training purely on GPUs, for inference, it uses a hybrid approach that includes CPUs. For inference tasks, eBay uses Intel ’s Deep Learning Boost (DL Boost) technology, which implements Vector Neural Network Instructions (VNNI) on Intel’s AVX-512 instruction set. It also utilizes 8-bit integer quantization, Kopru said. The system is deployed and scaled horizontally on a Kubernetes cluster configured using NUMA, he said. “Our custom implementation doubled the throughput with half of the latency compared to a non-VNNI implementation,” he said. eBay uses some of the same techniques to optimize the kNN setup, which is used for image classification. The company has paired its kNN image classification system with a Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) library to optimize search in the kNN space. For inference, it also brought in 8-digit integer quantization and Intel’s DL Boost library. Selcuk Kopru is head of machine learning and NLP at eBay The use of HNSW enables kNN search to perform at a high level and maintain low latency and high throughput on a catalog that contains a billion items, each with up to 768 dimensions, according to Kopru. “Compared to the existing implementation, we have observed up to 2.5X speed up in terms of latency, from 17 milliseconds to 7 milliseconds,” he said. Kopru left his audience with a few thoughts on how they might apply his learnings to their particular problems. For starters, similarity is a powerful tool that can be used to solve many AI problems in e-commerce and in other disciplines, Kopru said. “My second message is for latency and throughput,” he said. “Many optimizations need to be done, almost at every step of the machine learning lifecycle. Whether it is in training or inferencing, we have to make sure that we are using the right optimization methods, such as distillation and quantization on those platforms.” Finally, Kopru encourages practitioners to consider using a hybrid approach for inferencing to achieve utilization and cost efficiency goals. eBay also keeps a watchful eye on TPUs for benchmarking purposes. “These are well-known techniques and I really suggests everyone is using those techniques,” he said.

Updated: 13 Sep 2021, 10:42 PM IST Dattaraj Rao Zero-shot AI can save hours spent on searching for the needle in a haystack Read Full Story Artificial intelligence (AI) is being looked upon as the next frontier to make cyber-defence robust and scalable. The key aspects that make AI and particularly machine learning (ML) attractive in cybersecurity is the ability to learn from large volumes of telemetry data and find patterns of abnormal behaviour. ML algorithms can be used to find anomalies in different parts of the enterprise like application logs, network flows, user activities and authentication logs. As enterprises adopt models like zero-trust with strict identity verification and explicit permissions, augmenting these with ML algorithms to monitor user behaviour patterns becomes critical. Modern security information and event management and intrusion detection systems leverage ML to correlate network features, identify patterns in data and highlight anomalies corresponding to attacks. Security researchers spend many hours understanding these attacks and trying to classify them into known kinds like port sweep, password guess, teardrop, etc. However, due to the constantly changing attack landscape and the emergence of advanced persistent threats (APTs), hackers are continuously finding new ways to attack systems.

A static list of classification of attacks will not be able to adapt to new and novel tactics adopted by adversaries. Also, due to the constant flow of alarms generated by multiple sources in the network, it becomes difficult to distinguish and prioritize particular types of attacks—the classic alarm flooding problem. A possible solution would be if we had a smart system that could auto-label alarms and categorize them so that the analyst can focus on particular alarm types. We propose a dynamic classification system using a zero-shot classification approach to ML. What exactly is this? The traditional approach to applying ML is supervised, where labelled data points are used to train models to make predictions. For example, a classifier model may process a record logged by a network monitor and classify it as an attack. While this is useful, these models can only learn from previously known attacks; so, a human would need to annotate the network flow for the attack data and feed it to build the model. The other approach becoming popular is unsupervised, where models learn to observe “normal"" behaviour and flag any anomalies. This approach can highlight unknown attack patterns but only provide anomaly information to the security analyst. One approach to tackle this is an upcoming research area in AI/ML called Explainable AI (XAI). Here, the models are either redesigned or enhanced to provide an explanation along with the prediction. So, when the model predicts an anomaly, it will also mention which feature values made it make that decision. XAI and zero-shot learning can be applied to different areas of a cybersecurity ecosystem. Let’s take an example of an ML model that monitors network traffic in an office network. Say, it flags a data transmission above 100MB happening from a network computer to a Google drive account as an anomaly—different from normal network flows. If we show the security operation centre analyst additional parameters that made us flag this as anomaly, like size of data files and destination domain, this information can save the analyst valuable time in classifying this as a data exfiltration attack. The system can further take feedback from the analyst and start auto-labelling new such attacks as data exfiltration. Extrapolate this to a network with thousands of nodes and users, explainability and zero-shot learning can save hours of valuable time spent by analysts in searching for the needle in the haystack. In today’s world, enterprises face APTs, which are well-funded attackers that focus on a high-value target and can stay undetected inside networks for days. Behavioural analytics becomes key to understand patterns and identify tactics, techniques and procedures used by attackers. Zero-shot learning models that decipher tactics like reconnaissance, privilege escalation and exfiltration can be extremely valuable to prevent major damage. Over time, this active learning system can learn from feedback. TRENDING STORIES See All Premium Flipkart announces Big Billion Days sale, teases discou ....

The European Commission outlined its plans to regulate AI, including medical devices and in vitro diagnostics that feature the technology, earlier this year. Under the proposal, the European Union would require high-risk AI systems to ""comply with certain mandatory requirements"" before coming to market. The Commission acknowledged a risk of overlap with existing regulations but envisioned the framework complementing requirements such as the Medical Devices Regulation. However, MedTech Europe contends the proposal falls short of that vision. In feedback to the Commission, the EU medtech trade group highlighted multiple examples of perceived ""misalignment"" between MDR and IVDR and the Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA). MedTech Europe sees the misalignments having serious consequences. ""There are concerns that the AIA would in effect create the need for manufacturers to undertake duplicative certification/conformity assessment, via two Notified Bodies, and maintain two sets of technical documentation, should misalignments between AIA and MDR/IVDR not be resolved. Duplication of this kind would lead to unnecessary overlaps in the regulatory approval of AI as/in medical technology, which could have a negative effect on the timely access of citizens and patients to highly innovative and fairly priced AI medical technology in the EU,""  MedTech Europe wrote. The feedback covers a handful of specific areas in which MedTech Europe believes the regulations are misaligned. MedTech Europe's concerns about duplicative certification stem from a ""very possible scenario"" it sketched out in its feedback. If a notified body that is designated for MDR or IVDR lacks AI capabilities, ""the risk of needing two separate technical documentation submissions, leading to two separate conformity assessments and certifications, must be avoided."" MedTech Europe also sees a lack of clarity about the designation of notified bodies for ""AI-specific competencies,"" the time required to ramp up the availability of notified bodies with AI and medtech capabilities, and the roles and responsibilities of notified bodies as areas needing clarification. A further set of potential problems are tied to the interaction between AIA and EU rules on data protection and privacy. MedTech Europe highlighted several areas in which AIA may conflict with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). One example is the AIA requirement that datasets used to train, validate and test high-risk AI systems are ""relevant"" and ""representative."" MedTech Europe contends restrictions imposed by GDPR may make it difficult to comply with the requirement. Risk classification is another perceived issue. As MedTech Europe sees it, AIA would put most healthcare uses of AI in its highest risk class in a ""clear deviation from how medical technologies are regulated in Europe and around the world."" The deviation will cause confusion among regulators and ""create additional, unnecessary complexity in the regulatory approval process,"" the trade group wrote. MedTech Europe's expectation that medical devices and IVDs will fall into AIA's high-risk category is underpinned by ""the proposed broad definition of AI and risk classification."" The criticism of the definition follows an early response by a senior research scientist at the Flatiron Institute's Center for Computational Mathematics, who said it ""feels hopelessly vague with phrasing like 'wide variety of methods' and the inclusion of 'statistical approaches'."" Other groups have since taken shots at the proposal. The Center for Data Innovation found AIA could cost the EU economy up to €31 billion ($37 billion) over the next five years and cause investments to contract by up to 20%. The analysis found AIA will cost European businesses €10.9 billion a year by 2025. A business with a turnover of €10 million that deploys a high-risk AI system would see profits fall by 40%. The analysis is based on the Commission's own impact assessment and projections of the growth of AI investment in the EU. Absent AIA, the EU expects investment in AI to grow to almost €70 billion by 2025, up from €16 billion today. The Center for Data Innovation sees AIA as a major headwind to that forecast. In feedback to the Commission, the Center said that ""AIA is too broad in its attempt to regulate an entire stack of technologies and applications at such an early stage in the development of AI."" Other groups have made similar points to the Center and MedTech Europe, with the Japan Business Federation warning AIA could ""hinder the appetite for investment in Europe"" and Digital Poland Foundation calling the AI definition ""too broad."" However, other groups have responded more favorably. An EU mapping trade group called the proposal ""a good start"" and a group that works to ensure the digital world caters to young people hailed parts of AIA as ""ground-breaking legislation."" The breadth of organizations that have already responded to the proposal points to the challenges the EU will face in trying to come up with a version of AIA that works for medtech and all of the other stakeholders affected by the regulation. MedTech Europe wants more time to adapt to whatever AIA brings, arguing that at least 48 months, rather than the 24 months proposed by the Commission, are needed for ""the entire ecosystem to be ready and compliant with a new regulatory framework."" post share tweet print email Filed Under: Medical Devices, Policy & Regulation, Legal, Diagnostics, Digital Health, Imaging Editors' picks Brian Tucker/MedTech Dive Remote monitoring, wearable companies look to capitalize on virtual care boom: JPM21 Diabetes players Dexcom and Insulet both projected business growth and market expansion for this year during presentations.

The grant, awarded by the National Institutes of Health, is one of the largest ever to the medical school. It will support the work of the Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, led by Muredach Reilly, MBBCh, MSCE, professor of medicine and associate dean for clinical and translational research.  The Institute works in partnership with researchers and clinicians across Columbia University Irving Medical Center, NewYork-Presbyterian, and the New York State Psychiatric Institute to support all phases of clinical and translational science. The infusion of federal funding addresses a critical need in medical research. In labs at Columbia and at other universities across the nation, important scientific discoveries are made almost every day. But it typically takes a decade or more for a new scientific discovery to result in a new drug, medical device, or diagnostic tool. In 2006 the NIH launched a nationwide effort to identify and overcome scientific and organizational barriers that slow the movement of discoveries from the lab bench to the patient. The program, called the Clinical and Translational Science Award Program, today funds translational research “hubs” at more than 50 universities. The funding has enabled the Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research to establish more than 70 services and programs to help Columbia researchers translate medical discoveries into treatments, including: Training, mentoring, and one-on-one consultation to researchers. The Irving Institute trained over 2,200 individuals and provided more than 3,300 consultations to researchers since 2016. Access to research facilities, infrastructure, and specialized equipment that may not be available in a researcher’s own lab or department. Seed funding, including $4 million for pilot projects that enable researchers to generate preliminary data that can be used in applying for larger grants. Assistance in launching clinical trials to test new therapies and diagnostic tools. The Irving Institute also provided funding for the development of RecruitMe, an online registry for people interested in volunteering for clinical trials led by Columbia researchers. More than 30,000 people have signed up to participate. The new infusion of funding from the National Center for Advancing Translational Science at the NIH will enable the Irving Institute to develop new programs, including a Research Navigation System to help match the needs of individual researchers and research teams to resources and services available at Columbia. The Institute will also offer expanded training opportunities and a “data concierge service” that will link researchers with experts in biostatistics, biomedical informatics, and data science. They will also engage community leaders as “ambassadors” to promote research that improves community health. Columbia University was first awarded a CTSA grant in 2006, and the grant has been renewed every five years since then, with funding totaling over $200 million through 2026. This year’s application for funding renewal received a perfect overall score from the NIH’s review committee. Comments on the funding award: Muredach P. Reilly, MBBCh MSCE, Principal Investigator and Director, Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research : “On behalf of all our partners, I am delighted and honored that we achieved a perfect score at peer review for this 5-year renewal cycle of our CTSA. I am proud of our outstanding team and our partners at the Medical Center, NewYork-Presbyterian, New York State Psychiatric Institute, and across the University, as well as our regional and national collaborators, for their support and future commitments. Standing on the shoulders of the institution and building on our prior success, we have established innovative plans for the next five years to create novel scientific advances, through multiple programs, trainings, multidisciplinary initiatives and more. A key focus will be expansion of our interdisciplinary team approach across the hub, expanded participatory engagement with communities in Washington Heights, Inwood, South Bronx, and Harlem, along with new partnerships regionally and nationally, to achieve our goal to translate research to practice locally, nationally and across the world.” Lee C. Bollinger, President, Columbia University : “The pace and breadth of discovery in biomedical research has the potential to transform medicine. To deliver on that promise, we must expand our capacity to translate new knowledge into new tools and treatments. We’re deeply grateful to the National Institutes of Health for their support of this vital work.” U.S. Senator Charles E. Schumer (NY) : “I am thankful that Columbia University's Irving Institute, one of the nation's leading centers for clinical research, has received this well-deserved additional funding. The Institute has gained national recognition for its programs, and the grant will continue the Institute's mission to improve the health and well-being of our State's communities through innovations in clinical and translational science."" U.S. Congressman Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) : “The Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) has been a leader in clinical research, development of biomedical technologies, and advancements in translational science. Renewal of the Clinical and Translational Science Award to the Herbert and Florence Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, a partnership of CUIMC and NewYork-Presbyterian, recognizes the scientific advancements of talented scientists and researchers and confidence that CUIMC will continue to shape the health and wellbeing of my constituents and patients around the world.” Anil K. Rustgi, MD, Interim Executive Vice President and Dean of the Faculties of Health Sciences and Medicine : “Under Dr. Reilly’s leadership, the Irving Institute has established a world class program to accelerate the application of medical discoveries, and especially to engage underserved populations in the clinical research process. These efforts are fundamental to our mission to integrate research, teaching, clinical care, and community service at Columbia.” Steven J. Corwin, MD, President and Chief Executive Officer, NewYork-Presbyterian : “The Irving Institute is advancing research that saves lives and improves the quality of life for our patients and the communities we serve. We are proud to partner with Columbia to help develop new innovative treatments for complex medical problems and bring these advances from the lab to the bedside faster. This grant will allow us to continue the important work of accelerating medical innovation for all.” Nabila El-Bassel, PhD, the Willma and Albert Musher Professor of Social Work : ""The Irving Institute engages in outstanding impactful research for the most vulnerable members of our society, and I value its promotion of multidisciplinary research collaboration within Columbia. Collaborating with the Irving Institute with the HEALing Communities Study (HCS) provided important insights for both HCS and for our new Center for Healing of Opioid and Other Substance Use Disorders – Enhancing Intervention, Development and Implementation (CHOSEN), helping inform both their community-based strategies and implementation research.""

A couple of weeks ago, Affirm jumped more than 40% in a day when it announced a partnership with Amazon, and the stock soared again last week after better-than-expected earnings from the fintech company. 8h ago Motley Fool Why Castor Maritime and Seanergy Stocks Popped Today What happened Following in the wake of fellow dry bulk shipping stocks Diana Shipping (NYSE: DSX) last week and Safe Bulkers (NYSE: SB) Monday morning, Seanergy Maritime Holdings (NASDAQ: SHIP) and Castor Maritime (NASDAQ: CTRM) surged ahead to close the trading session up 12% and 13%. 6h ago Motley Fool General Electric Investors: Prepare for a Bumpy Quarter General Electric's (NYSE: GE) latest investor update left Wall Street concerned that the industrial giant's third-quarter report might not be as positive as many had expected.

Read this first If your deceased loved on (the decedent) left appreciated capital gain assets — such as real property and/or securities held in taxable brokerage firm accounts, the federal income tax basis of those assets are increased to reflect fair market value (FMV) as of: (1) the decedent’s date of death or (2) the alternate valuation date of six months later if the executor of the estate chooses to use the alternate valuation date.  Then, when an inherited capital gain asset is sold, federal capital gains tax is only owed the appreciation (if any) that occurs after the applicable magic date.  This pro-taxpayer rule can dramatically lower or even eliminate the federal income tax hit when an inherited asset is sold. 12h ago Motley Fool Why Crescent Point Energy Stock Rallied 14.4% Today Shares of Crescent Point Energy (NYSE: CPG) soared on Sept. 13, closing the day up 14.4% after the oil stock unexpectedly announced a big dividend raise.

In 2015, representatives from more than 196 countries met in Le Bourget, France to sign the Paris Agreement. The legally binding treaty limits global warming to a rise of well below 2 degrees Celsius compared to preindustrial levels, preferably capping warming at 1.5 degrees. While the Paris Agreement doesn’t spell out how the undersigned are expected to achieve this goal, some countries have pledged to cut their net climate emissions to zero by 2050. For these and other steps to be successful, reliable data is key. While the ability to evaluate companies’ carbon footprints will be critical for countries seeking to comply with the measures, only a fraction of companies currently disclose their greenhouse gas emissions. But researchers at Bloomberg Quant Research and Amazon Web Services claim to have successfully trained a machine learning model to estimate the emissions of businesses that don’t disclose their emissions. The researchers say investors could use this model to align their investments with international regulatory measures and achieve net-zero goals. Some regions, including the European Union, require investors to apply a “precautionary principle” that penalizes non-disclosing companies by overestimating their emissions. “Merely 2.27% of companies filing financial statements are disclosing their [greenhouse gas] emissions according to our environmental, social, and governance (ESG) datasets,” the coauthors wrote in a paper. “In order to make a meaningful change, we need to measure who is contributing [greenhouse gases] into the atmosphere and monitor their claims to decarbonize.” Training the model Prior work attempted to estimate companies’ carbon emissions using a combination of conventional statistical approaches and machine learning. But according to the researchers, these approaches relied on assumptions that don’t always hold true in reality, like the idea that companies in the same industry emit roughly the same level of emissions. To train their model, the researchers identified more than 1,000 features and 24,052 rows of disclosed emissions from datasets containing company financials (like balance sheets and income statements), corporate locations, and ESG records. The ESG records had over 500 metrics alone, covering areas like carbon emissions and resource and energy use; human rights and diversity and inclusion; and criteria based on management structure, executive compensation, and employee relations. In an experiment designed to evaluate the model’s accuracy, the researchers say the model closely estimated the emissions of companies in industries including health care, technology, financial, materials, real estate, utilities, energy, communications, and more. In future work, the team plans to add more features from datasets across areas like corporate policy, supply chain, and factory data. “By training a machine learning model on disclosed … emissions, we are able to estimate the emissions of other companies globally who do not disclose their emissions,” the researchers wrote. “In this paper, we show that our model provides accurate estimates of corporate … emissions.” While studies suggest some forms of machine learning contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, the technology has also been proposed as a tool to combat climate change. For example, an IBM project delivers farm cultivation recommendations from digital farm “twins” that simulate the future weather and soil conditions of real-world crops. Other researchers are using AI-generated images to help visualize climate change, and nonprofits like WattTime are working to reduce households’ carbon footprint by automating when electric vehicles, thermostats, and appliances are active based on where renewable energy is available. Facebook chief AI scientist Yann LeCun and Google Brain cofounder Andrew Ng, among others, have argued that mitigating climate change and promoting energy efficiency are worthy challenges for AI researchers.

Become an Insider and start reading now. Joaquin Quiñonero Candela has left Facebook after serving as its head of Responsible AI. Candela was tapped by CEO Mark Zuckerberg to battle misinformation on Facebook. Misinformation is still widespread on the largest social-media platform. Joaquin Quiñonero Candela, who most recently led Facebook's Responsible AI team, has left the company. Candela's work, and hardships leading the team tasked with reining in Facebook's artificial intelligence, was the subject of an MIT Tech Review feature earlier this year, to which the company strongly objected. The researcher announced his departure on his LinkedIn profile and on the Partnership on AI website , where he still serves on the board of directors. MIT Tech Review described Candela being forced into an impossible situation of fixing AI at Facebook after he helped build a lot of the tools the company relied on. ""I am taking a break to fully support my wife with rebuilding her career, and to enjoy our kids before they all leave the nest,"" the former distinguished technical lead wrote on LinkedIn. ""I recently resigned from Facebook after 9.5 amazing years in order to create the space I need."" In an earlier Facebook post, he said he was taking an ""internet sabbatical."" Facebook confirmed his departure and denied that it was related to the MIT Tech Review story. Candela worked on AI at Facebook for more than nine years, starting with advertising optimization using machine learning and ending his career at the company leading the Responsible AI team. He was critical in building Facebook's machine-learning pipeline , which was used to spin up new ML algorithms for projects around the company. He was also a part of the company's use of AI to monitor live videos streaming on Facebook. In 2016, Candela said he envisioned Facebook's video platform as a custom TV channel that would automatically show users live videos of what they were most interested in, based on their Facebook interactions. MIT Tech Review reported Candela had direct access to Mark Zuckerberg as a member of the Applied Machine Learning team, which sat in close proximity to the CEO. Zuckerberg also relied heavily on Candela's expertise in arranging the company's response to misinformation on the site, which it still struggles to contain. Sign up for notifications from Insider!

Among other tech-related subjects, the series has tackled artificial intelligence or AI. AI regulation has recently become the focus of discussion globally as AI is being rapidly deployed in various sectors.  A recent example is the use of AI by Moderna to speed up the development of the Covid-19 vaccine. While many countries are gearing up to roll out regulations on the use of AI, SA lags behind. The closest South Africa has come to regulating AI is in creating the Presidential Commission on the 4 th Industrial Revolution (4IR) in 2019, which recommended, among other things, establishing the National Artificial Intelligence Institute. Since a legally binding set of rules to govern AI is yet to be passed in South Africa, we have considered recent developments in the regulation of AI in the UK and the EU to determine whether South African regulators should follow their example. Regulatory developments on AI in the UK In June 2021, the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) (the UK’s watchdog in charge of upholding information rights and protecting personal information), published an opinion on the use of Live Facial Recognition Technology (LFRT).  LFRT collects biometric information, such as fingerprints, irises, or facial features of individuals, in real-time. The ICO’s opinion focuses on the applicability of data protection law to the use of LFRT. Data protection law applies to the processing of LFRT, given that it involves the processing of several types of personal data under the GDPR (the EU’s equivalent of POPIA, South Africa’s data protection law), including personal, biometric and criminal offence data. LFRT can be used for many purposes. At the time of publishing the opinion, the ICO had completed investigations into six examples of planned or actual use of LFRT in public places. The examples included the use of LFRT for surveillance, marketing and advertising. The opinion emphasises the ICO’s data protection concerns about the use of LFRT. These include: the automatic collection of biometric data at speed and scale without justification (in many examples, the organisation processing data could not show that the processing was necessary and proportionate to the purpose of the collection of the data); and the lack of choice or control by those people whose data was being collected. Other concerns raised by the ICO include the lack of transparency afforded to those people on how, when and why their data was being processed, as well as the potential for bias and discrimination.  (LFRT works with less precision for some demographic groups, including women, minority ethnic groups and disabled people, owing to design flaws or deficiencies in training data). To address its concerns, the ICO emphasised that organisations must ensure that their use of LFRT meets the requirements of lawfulness, fairness and transparency, and a robust evaluation of necessity and proportionality should be conducted. These requirements are based on GDPR principles, which are also present in POPIA. While the ICO set out these obligatory requirements for the lawful use of LFRT, it concluded that any investigation into the use of LFRT should be circumstance- and fact-specific. Regulatory developments on AI in the EU In April 2021, the EU Data Protection Board and EU Data Protection Supervisor published a joint opinion on the European Commission’s set of proposals for the introduction of harmonised rules on AI (Proposal). The purpose of the Proposal was to achieve legal certainty within the AI industry, to ensure that AI systems are safe and respect EU laws and values. However, the Board and Supervisor highlighted various concerns with the Proposal. These include: the exclusion of international law enforcement co-operation from the scope of the Proposal, which might risk circumvention by third party countries and international organisations using AI systems within the EU; and the need for clarification that the GDPR and the Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive (an EU directive on data protection and privacy in the digital age) shall apply to the use of AI Systems. While the Board and Supervisor welcomed the risk-based approach to AI adopted by the European Commission, they highlighted the need to ensure that AI systems, including those that do not involve the processing of personal data but still impact the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals, also fall within the scope of the Proposal. A further concern highlighted by the Board and Supervisor is that the Proposal requires the providers of AI systems to perform a risk assessment. However, in most cases, the controllers (as defined in the GDPR) or the responsible party (as defined in POPIA) will be the users, rather than the providers, of the AI systems. While it is clear from these two opinions that the UK and EU are still grappling with how to regulate AI, these opinions may provide South Africa’s regulators with a guideline on what may be important in a local data protection context in regulating AI. With the rapid growth in SA’s tech sector, the country is in in desperate need of AI regulation. After all, a Black Mirror-esque future may not be too far off.

This $177 million deal, which was initiated back in July, is aimed at expanding Omnicell’s Advanced Services portfolio. The acquisition particularly adds a comprehensive and differentiated suite of SaaS financial management, analytics, and population health solutions to Omnicell’s EnlivenHealth division. According to Omnicell, this acquisition will enable new clinical services and expand growth and profitability opportunities. The Acquisition and Strategic Synergies Omnicell’s EnlivenHealth provides patient engagement solutions for retail pharmacies and health plans. It targets to provide advanced digital solutions to measurably improve patient health outcomes and also drive growth and profitability. The ongoing pandemic situation has accelerated some major healthcare trends like digitizing care delivery including telehealth and shifting the point of care to a broader range of settings, including innovative hospital-at-home programs and local pharmacies. According to Omnicell, in such a situation, the FDS Amplicare acquisition is expected to enable it and its EnlivenHealth division to gain from the industry-wide trends, banking on comprehensive offerings of digital technologies, SaaS solutions, and tech-enabled services. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The acquisition of FDS Amplicare’s differentiated financial management, analytics, and population health solutions, along with its nationwide network of more than 15,000 independent retail pharmacies has broadened EnlivenHealth’s industry footprint. Further, Omnicell noted that at present Direct & Indirect Remuneration (DIR) fees continue to challenge the business health of the retail pharmacy industry, especially independent pharmacies. FDS Amplicare’s offerings are playing a crucial role in helping retail pharmacies manage, forecast, and mitigate their DIR fee exposure. Omnicell claims that when combined with EnlivenHealth’s clinical and data science capabilities, this differentiated, multi-pronged offering will enable retail pharmacies to bend the DIR growth curve. Favorable Industry Trend Going by an imarc report , the global patient engagement solutions market exhibited strong growth during 2015-2020. The market is expected to witness a CAGR of around 13% during 2021-2026. Looking at this market’s huge growth potential, we believe the latest acquisition of FDS Amplicare to be well-timed. Notable Developments On Sep 7, 2021, Omnicell announced the opening of a new software development center through its subsidiary based in Bangalore, India. The company’s new center will focus on product innovation to advance its strategy to deliver the cloud-based infrastructure in order to support the Autonomous Pharmacy. This new center is likely to expand the company’s cloud-based solutions portfolio. In August 2021, Omnicell announced the latest enhancements to its industry-leading portfolio of medication management solutions. These new capabilities, included in the company’s Summer 2021 Release, focus on superior customer experience and innovation to drive maximum value sooner; and deliver improved workflow efficiency, expanded automation, and enhanced medication management intelligence. In July 2021, Omnicell’s long-time partner Spartanburg Regional Healthcare System selected the company’s medication management platform to enhance efficiency, control, and safety across the care continuum. Through this collaboration, Omnicell’s Central Pharmacy Dispensing and IV Compounding Services will aid Spartanburg Regional in its journey toward zero-error medication management and the fully autonomous pharmacy. Share Price Performance The stock has outperformed its industry over the past year. It has rallied 116.4% against the industry’s 15.4% decline.

Why its days are numbered. R.I.P Covid! It's the new silver bullet, the next best thing since the vaccine PALO ALTO, Calif. (PRWEB) September 13, 2021 Qare Inc., today announced the launch of ASGARD™, the first, comprehensive, cloud-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) solution that removes all barriers to safely return to work post-Covid-19. Using the AI software, all organizations, from large enterprises to small businesses and schools to health care providers, can fully verify, track and manage vaccinations to prevent, control and mitigate Covid-19 in the workplace. Employees of these institutions no longer need to fear Covid-19 and can now safely return to work and live life as it was meant to be. Even with tremendous progress in vaccinations, an unbiased examination of the data will reveal that there is still much reason to fear in the here and now. There are more weekly infections now than at any other time since the start of the pandemic, excepting the peak period of Dec and Jan. As travel and mask restrictions are removed, newer and more deadly strains are popping up. Studies based on scientific research have shown that no amount of hygiene theater or workplace re-engineering can fully prevent the airborne transmission of Covid-19, particularly in indoor spaces. There is certainly a risk of contagion indoors and the valid concerns of workers about workplace safety is not being heard. Below citations are from just two of many such studies: Study I: https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/71/9/2311/5867798 Study II: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-16/covid-is-airborne-scientists-say-now-authorities-think-so-too Qare Inc. saw this coming and put data/smarts to work. Qare's AI solution ASGARD™ automatically collects and processes consent-based employee health data from smart health cards to verify vaccination and track Covid-19 risk dynamically at each location with pinpoint accuracy. And prevention and control measures can be initiated in real-time with highly granular access control measures. Says Kate Beckett, an early Beta customer from a midsize business, ""It's the new silver bullet, the next best thing since the vaccine. So now, we can be sure of an infection free work environment, instead of merely wishing or hoping for one"". Just as President Joe Biden is unveiling new vaccine mandates to combat Covid-19 and save lives, Qare Inc. has come up with the perfect new advanced AI solution to implement it. Qare's ASGARD™ can verify, track, monitor and manage vaccinations automatically with a touch-free workflow as well as intelligently control risks and mitigate vulnerabilities. However, this tool was not opportunely conceived overnight, but is a product of meticulous research and development for well over a year. Details on how companies big and small can access and deploy these silver bullets in the raging war against Covid-19 can be found at https://qare.ai About Qare Inc.

If you have heard the crackle of stale, yellow grass beneath your feet this summer, you’re not alone. Nearly 100% of Oregon is currently in severe drought, according to the United States Drought Monitor . Since 2015 Oregon has experienced drought each and every summer, the severity of which continues to increase as global temperatures rise. Gov. Brown has responded to Oregon’s drought by ordering government agencies to stop watering lawns. Large institutions like Oregon State University have also cut back on water consumption by installing low-flow faucets and toilets; watching water-meter usage to spot leaks; and installing rainwater-catch basins in newer buildings and an irrigation control system across campus to measure humidity, temperature and evaporation rate. “All Oregon State University employees and students can contribute by conserving the state’s dwindling water supply within the operation of our campuses, centers and offices,” said OSU Interim President Becky Johnson in a prepared statement. “At the same time, OSU researchers are engaged in efforts to understand and address the many impacts of the drought and ensuing wildfires, and OSU Extension agents are providing support in communities experiencing hardships.” Oregon’s drought issues are only going to get worse as time goes on. Sophisticated irrigation technologies and predictive analytics could mean the difference between Oregonians merely feeling annoyed during the summer months or feeling the pain of ecological and economic collapse. Not only is drought murder on lawns, it’s incredibly costly. An estimate from the National Center for Environmental Information found drought cost $9 billion for businesses every year. Oregon farmers and ranchers have a particularly difficult time with drought. Not only do these businesses depend on water consumption to produce output, but farm workers are less able to function in the heat. Livestock also need to drink more water and spend more time in cooling stations when temperatures are high. Dave Mackie, CEO of Austin-based startup Olea Edge Analytics, says water management is spurring an arms race of aqua-tech. Using sensors, artificial intelligence and predictive algorithms, Olea Edge hopes to make a splash in Portland and other cities losing money on drought. According to Mackie, cities lose 20% to 30% of their water on average due to runoff, leakage and other maintenance issues resulting from use. While his technology doesn’t create more water, the process — called Hydraulic Modeling — monitors and adapts quickly to leaks and stuck turbines, and predicts future problems using AI. The process could save cities and companies millions of dollars in water bills and increased production. A city water meter hooked up to an Olea Edge Analytics sneson. Photo: Olea Edge Analytics . “We’re computerizing what hasn’t been computerized before,” says Mackie. “The majority of the meters we install are for predictive technology. We identify problems that are going to be there and fix them effectively.” Just like a leaky faucet or a drip under the kitchen sink, water-loss issues are usually not identified until they have already caused a significant amount of damage. Mackie estimates a city like Portland could save 3 billion gallons of water each year. For reference, the city consumes approximately 8.7 billion gallons annually. The system is also doubly sustainable, as it runs off solar power. RELATED STORY: Robots on the Farm In the meantime, Oregon universities are taking their own steps to conserve water. This year 13 researchers from OSU’s College of Engineering — in partnership with the University of Washington — are participating in AgAID , a $20 million federal effort to develop artificial intelligence to address farming’s biggest problems, including diminishing water supplies caused by climate change. One thing OSU’s program and Olea Analytics has in common? Big data. “We are bringing in algorithms and data science as part of the puzzle,” says Alan Fern, professor of computer science and lead investigator representing Oregon State. “Water management is one of the most significant thrusts. A lot of it is setting up good data pipelines for what is there.” To subscribe to Oregon Business , click here .

Video Azure Visual Studio Visual Studio Code Blazor/ASP.NET .NET C#/VB/TypeScript Xamarin/Mobile AI/Machine Learning News New Open Source ONNX Runtime Web Does Machine Learning Modeling in Browser By David Ramel 09/13/2021 Microsoft introduced  a new feature for the open source ONNX Runtime machine learning model accelerator for running JavaScript-based ML models running in browsers. The new ONNX Runtime Web (ORT Web) was introduced this month as a new feature for the cross-platform ONNX Runtime used to optimize and accelerate ML inferencing and training. It's all part of the ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) ecosystem that serves as an open standard for ML interoperability. Microsoft says ONNX Runtime inference can enable faster customer experiences and lower costs, as it supports models from deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow/Keras along with classical ML libraries like scikit-learn, LightGBM, XGBoost and more. It's compatible with different hardware, drivers and OSes, providing optimal performance by leveraging hardware accelerators where applicable, alongside graph optimizations and transforms. The JavaScript-based ORT Web for the ONNX Runtime isn't a brand-new product, however, as it replaces Microsoft's ONNX.js Javascript library for running ONNX models on browsers and on Node.js, supposedly providing an enhanced user experience and improved performance. Specifically, the new tool is said to provide a more consistent developer experience between packages for server-side and client-side inferencing, along with improved inference performance and model coverage. Key to all that is a two-pronged back-end approach to accelerate model inference in the browser with the help of both machine CPUs and their graphics-oriented GPU counterparts. That involves WebAssembly back-end functionality on the CPU side (it lets C++ code be used in the browser instead of JavaScript), whereas the GPU side of things leverages WebGL, a popular standard for accessing GPU capabilities. [Click on image for larger view.] ORT Web Overview (source: Microsoft). ""Running machine-learning-powered web applications in browsers has drawn a lot of attention from the AI community,"" Microsoft said in an announcement early this month. ""It is challenging to make native AI applications portable to multiple platforms given the variations in programming languages and deployment environments. Web applications can easily enable cross-platform portability with the same implementation through the browser. Additionally, running machine learning models in browsers can accelerate performance by reducing server-client communications and simplify the distribution experience without needing any additional libraries and driver installations."" Microsoft is soliciting developer feedback on the project, which can be provided on the ONNX Runtime GitHub repo . As it continues to work on and improve the tool's performance and model coverage and introduce new features, one possible enhancement being considered is on-device model training.

Share Article A patient receiving radiation therapy. Credit: Mark Kostich / Getty Images Need to Know: GlobalData’s proprietary model uses a combination of machine learning and an algorithm to calculate an individual drug’s Phase Transition Success Rate (PTSR) and Likelihood of Approval (LoA). While LoA provides the probability of a drug ultimately receiving market authorization, PTSR indicates the probability of a drug’s advancement to the next stage of clinical development. The model uses data points from the individual drugs, clinical trials, regulatory milestones, company, and financial databases. Ology’s cervical, vaginal cancer asset bolstered after suspended Phase III resumes Ology Bioservices’ cervical and vaginal cancer asset NTO-1151 (triapine) saw its LoA jump after its suspended Phase III trial resumed recruitment. Triapine’s LoA increased by 24 points to 43% in cervical cancer and 23 points to 47% in vaginal cancer. The LoA changed on 6 September after the Phase III trial’s ClinicalTrials.gov entry was updated on 2 September. The 450-patient trial was suspended on 1 June due to drug supply issues. Triapine inhibits ribonucleoside reductase; it blocks enzymes relevant for tumor cell growth. The Phase III is combining triapine with cisplatin chemotherapy during radiation therapy. It has a primary endpoint of overall survival within a five-year timeframe. MaxCyte focus shift negatively impacts Phase I ovarian cancer asset MaxCyte’s mesothelin-targeting chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) therapy MCY-M11 had its PTSR plummet in fallopian tube, ovarian, and peritoneal cancers. This is on the back of a Phase I basket trial termination. MCY-M11’s PTSR dived by 26 points to 31% in fallopian tube cancer, 24 points to 27% in ovarian cancer, and 27 points to 31% in peritoneal cancer. The PTSR update occurred on 6 September. On 30 August, the Phase I trial’s ClinicalTrials.gov listing was updated to state the trial was terminated due to MaxCyte shifting its focus. The trial was anticipated to enrol 27 patients when it started recruiting in August 2018 but accrued only 14 participants. The dose-escalation study was designed to investigate MCY-M11’s feasibility, safety, and tolerability. It recruited patients with recurrence after prior chemotherapy, administering MCY-M11 as an intraperitoneal infusion for three weekly doses. MCY-M11 is an mRNA-based anti-mesothelin CAR-PBMC cell therapy manufactured using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Its LoA also dropped to 1% in all three indications. Takeda’s Ninlaro in hematologic cancers boosted by positive Phase II data Takeda Pharmaceutical’s Ninlaro (ixazomib) had its PTSR jump in several hematologic cancers on the back of a Phase II basket trial data reveal. Its PTSR jumped by 23 points to 48% in chronic myelogenous leukemia, 19 points to 50% in acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and 17 points to 39% in Hodgkin’s lymphoma, as of 3 September. The next day, it also had an 8-point increase to 14% in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Results from the investigator-led Phase II trial were posted on ClinicalTrials.gov on 1 September. In the primary endpoint, 10 out of 25 patients (40%) relapsed or progressed at one-year post-treatment. Patients first undergo stem cell transplant (haploidentical transplantation) with a conditioning regimen of chemotherapy and radiation treatment. After which, patients were given Ninlaro weekly for three weeks, every 28-day cycle up to 12 cycles. Ninlaro is a proteasome inhibitor. It garnered FDA approval on November 2015 in combination with two other therapies in multiple myeloma patients who received at least one prior therapy. Ninlaro’s LoA also jumped by 7 to 8 points in all four hematologic cancers, with ALL having the highest LoA at 21% and CLL the lowest at 12%. Pliant’s fibrotic lung disease asset transition to next trial rise by five points Pliant Therapeutics’ PLN-74809 saw its PTSR in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) rise five points to 40% following the release of positive interim Phase IIa results. The PTSR change went live on 9 September, two days after Phase IIa data was reported (7 September). The 12-patient Phase IIa uses PET scans to evaluate the target engagement of four PLN-74809 dose levels in patients with mild or moderate IPF, the trial’s primary endpoint. All patients achieved more than 50% target engagement, which a previous study established as a benchmark for a predicted clinical antifibrotic effect. Stanford University is listed as a collaborator. PLN-74809 is a dual selective inhibitor of integrin beta 6/integrin beta 1, with the Phase IIa using an integrin beta 6 PET ligand to evaluate target engagement. The trial data also resulted in a two-point bump to PLN-74809’s LoA, which rose to 14%.

The vInsight platform also includes the vInsight™ Developer tool, which enables customers to create AI-based VHM algorithms, and the vInsight™ Edge embedded inferencing engine, which enables efficient execution of vehicle health monitors onboard the vehicle. Fleet operational efficiency is impacted by multiple factors including vehicle health conditions, driver behavior, drive cycle, mission planning, and more. Although ample data is available today to fleet managers, the complex relationships between these factors make it difficult to identify, isolate, and prioritize the contributing factors and drive effective actions. Generating actionable insights often requires manual analysis of reports by experienced individuals, which delivers limited results. Existing fleet management solutions use telematics data to track each vehicle’s location, fuel use, engine status, and driver behavior to make sure that rules are followed and best practices are kept. They also interpret diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) to initiate repairs and create maintenance reminders based on mileage and hours of service. These capabilities are primarily reactive and inefficiently preventative. vInsight Fleet uses state-of-the art machine learning and deep learning technology to learn the complex relationships between multiple contributing factors within the vehicle and across the fleet by utilizing telematics data and vehicle health indicators that are proactively generated by the vInsight platform. The AI identifies and isolates factors that impact operational efficiency, fuel consumption, and maintenance costs. SafeRide’s AI technology advances fleet management with predictive capabilities and operational insights that were not available before. It helps reduce maintenance costs, minimize diagnostic and repair time, optimize fuel consumption, mitigate roadside repairs, and minimize downtime. SafeRide also announced today a partnership with Traffilog , a leading provider of telematics, advanced diagnostics, and predictive maintenance services for commercial fleets. Traffilog will integrate SafeRide’s new solution to provide its fleet customers cutting-edge advancements in predictive maintenance and fleet operational efficiency. ”Traffilog’s advanced telematics and data acquisition capabilities provide access to valuable vehicle data”, said Yossi Vardi, SafeRide’s CEO and Co-Founder. “Integrating SafeRide’s deep learning and big data analytics technology together with Traffilog’s platform enables us to deliver best-in-class diagnostics and predictive maintenance services to commercial fleets worldwide.” “SafeRide’s deep learning technology enables us to further increase the value we deliver to our fleet customers”, said Erez Lorber, CEO of Traffilog. “Integrating vInsight Fleet into our platform provides our customers with unprecedented capabilities to optimize their fleet’s performance and reduce their vehicles’ total cost of ownership.” vInsight Fleet integrates with telematics and fleet management solutions using open APIs, which enable the use of data from multiple sources and the delivery of insights to each fleet’s preferred management system. The vInsight Fleet software can run on public or private cloud or on premises. SafeRide is demonstrating the vInsight Fleet solution this week at the American Trucking Association’s Technology and Maintenance Council Fall Meeting in Cleveland, Ohio.

Continuing the mission of educating and empowering Bay Area youth, 49ers EDU presented by Chevron has announced a new partnership with SAP. Driven by a shared vision of increasing awareness and interest in data science and technology career paths, the two global brands will collaborate on a series of initiatives that will integrate such topics into the 49ers EDU curriculum. SAP first joined the 49ers family in 2014 by signing on as a corporate partner and Official Business Solutions Provider and Analytics Partner. Then in 2018, the organizations partnered to unveil the Executive Huddle, a first-of-its-kind venue management system providing real-time data visualizations spanning multiple data sources. The suite allows the 49ers business strategy and analytics team to monitor and respond to certain operational areas on major event days at Levi's Stadium, including NFL gamedays, concerts, international soccer fixtures, and more. Now, after three years of intensive planning, the 49ers and SAP are using Executive Huddle to not only improve the fan experience, but grow the next generation of STEAM professionals. The Executive Huddle and SAP will be integrated into the 49ers EDU Virtual Lesson Series with a dedicated lesson on data science and analytics, including math vocabulary and concepts frequently used by company employees. Capable of being adjusted to fit accordingly with K-8 academics, the Virtual Lesson Series features other lessons covering art, math, environmental sustainability, and career path exploration. An extension of the program's in-person offerings, the Virtual Lesson Series brings the Levi's® Stadium field trip experience directly to students in a distance learning format via remote teaching and instruction. SAP will also provide company personnel as guest speakers to further explain the material and provide examples of what data science jobs can look like. Once registering for the 49ers EDU Virtual Lesson featuring SAP, educators will receive a recorded introductory video, setting the stage for their scheduled live Virtual Lesson. This video will also be made available on-demand as a way for students and families to learn about math and data science in a condensed manner that fits their schedule. ""We have one of the best tools in the world to visualize data science, so we think it makes perfect sense to partner with SAP and use the Executive Huddle to teach students how important, and fun, these topics really are,"" said Jesse Lovejoy, Director of 49ers EDU. ""Having support from such a well-known partner like SAP really helps with creating material that will be respected and compelling for learners across the region. Upon resumption, the 49ers EDU STEAM Education Field Trip Program will expand by opening high school registration for the first time. High school programming will take students directly to the Executive Huddle suite at the stadium, where they will partake in educational activities mimicking data science scenarios that 49ers executives might see on gamedays. For all field trips to the Executive Huddle, a 49ers and/or SAP employee will be present to share first-hand experience using the technology. ""SAP is committed to building the digital skills of the next generation,"" says Max Wessel, Chief Learning Officer of SAP. ""By partnering with 49ers EDU to design a curriculum that inspires exploration of data science and analytics, we hope to create opportunity for all learners – no matter their future career paths."" Earlier this year, the 49ers and SAP also partnered to join the Data Science for Everyone coalition . By joining industry leaders, schools, universities, policymakers, funders, and individuals, the two brands committed to elevating the importance of data literacy through their work.

Automatic live transcriptions / closed captions in English were announced to be coming to free Zoom accounts in February 2021 . Now Zoom says it “plans to provide real-time transcription for (as many as 30 additional languages) by the end of next year.” As part of that push, Zoom will also offer translation services for paid accounts, with the plan “to support real-time translation across as many as 12 languages by the end of next year.” Zoom wasn’t able to share details about which languages will be supported and when, but did say these improvements are a direct result of the machine learning know-how it gained by acquiring German translation company Kites . Zoom Whiteboard, as accessed through the Zoom app. Image: Zoom The other major change is coming to Zoom’s whiteboard feature. Zoom currently lets you create and share whiteboards during meetings to doodle together while you talk, but a planned expansion launching in beta later this year will make Zoom Whiteboard available outside of meetings in Zoom apps and the web. The basic drawing tools don’t appear to be different from what Zoom currently offers, the main change is how Zoom is treating Whiteboard as a product alongside video calls, rather than a feature that lives inside of them.

Innovation I am a Forbes Fellow writing for the Health & Science vertical. Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Aoi Senju Colabra Colabra - a company working to provide scientists a platform to share research and other data with each other - announced Monday that it has raised $1.5 million from an oversubscribed pre-seed funding round. Investors in the round include Village Global, Longtail Health Ventures, Builders VC, BoxOne Ventures, and others. The San Francisco-based company was established to help bring the scientific method to a digital space by offering scientists a platform where they can look at the work of other scientists on their teams. Its platform enables scientists to comment on experiments, track work being done and integrate DNA sequences, molecular structures and microscopic images. “Scientists are able to build on the work of others, instead of trying to find all of this data,” cofounder and CEO Aoi Senju says. The idea of Colabra came into fruition after Senju met his fellow cofounder Philip Seifi at a Launch House event last October, which is a residency program where entrepreneurs network. At the event, the two were paired as roommates and after getting to know each other and participating in hackathons together, they realized they worked well together. They enjoyed that partnership so much that by the end of their time at the event, the duo was already entertaining the idea of starting a company. Before shifting his focus into software and data science, Senju had studied chemical engineering. As he learned more about data science, he found that practices such as “code review and agile project management” were missing from the scientific field. That inspiration is what  led to the company being founded in January 2021. “The basis of Colabra was to take many of the best practices that exist in other fields and bring it into scientific research in a familiar format,” Senju says. “There’s a massive problem in science today of redundant work - experiments have already been done or dead ends that other people have run up against.” Matthew De Silva, syndicate lead and angel investor for Longtail Health Ventures, has seen scientists use various solutions to effectively conduct and analyze experiments at his California-based company Notable Labs - that finds the most effective treatment to specific cancers. “We've had folks try traditional paper lab notebooks, general-purpose tools like Evernote, and enterprise-grade lab notebooks like Benchling,” De Silva says. “When I was introduced to Colabra and met Aoi and Philip, their product felt novel — it was the first time I'd seen a clean, powerful, intuitive, tool purpose-built for day-to-day scientific work.” MORE FOR YOU Russian Telecom Operator MTS Launches $100 Million Venture Fund ‘This Is Europe’s Moment’: Lightspeed Venture Partners Hires Paul Murphy To Lead Europe Push This Startup Just Raised $6 Million For An App That Helps Treat Addiction “As a scientist and entrepreneur, I've experienced firsthand the lack of tools designed for scientists when trying to plan, execute, and analyze experiments,” Milad Alucozai, Head of Bio & Deep Tech at BoxOne Ventures. “I see Colabra becoming the go-to collaboration and data integration platform for scientists.” Currently the company is in closed beta with the intention to publicly release the product in late October. “Within the first week of launching their private beta, Colabra was getting feedback from  their scientists, telling the team how much further they'd be in their research if Colabra had existed years ago,” partner at Village Global, Anne Dwane says. The market for electronic lab notebooks has seen growth as the field becomes digital - leading to an increase in need for faster, more accurate results. The market size last year was reportedly over $550 million, according to Verified Market Research . With its seed funding in place, the company looks to grow its engineering team. In doing so, the company plans to be better equipped to add more features to the platform as well as better meet the needs of clients. The company will be looking to integrate with companies such as Slack, Trello and Asana to improve its project management software. “In the future we want to aggregate scientific data, not only to come up with meaningful conclusions from the experiments themselves, but to derive deeper insights that the scientist would have otherwise missed in the past,” Senju says. “And what we see with Colabra is enabling… scientific organizations to leverage and build on the brainpower of every scientist at that organization” Jair Hilburn Print Reprints & Permissions",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Read for deep dives into the unmissable ideas and topics shaping our world. Sponsored by Sep 13, 2021 TODAY It’s here. On our streets and in our neighborhoods. From traffic control to CCTVs to water-monitoring systems , artificial intelligence and machine-learning technologies are already among us. But, as the song goes, you ain’t seen nothin’ yet. Many argue that smart technology is making our cities safer, with facial detection able to spot and locate wanted criminals or people who violate public health restrictions. Others believe the presence of near ubiquitous CCTV cameras on the streets of many modern cities, from London to Beijing, amounts to intrusion on a massive scale. Either way, the role played by AI in shaping our urban environments is only going to grow and spread. In today’s Daily Dose, we look at global cities that are offering us an early glimpse of what the future might look like. Listen Toyloy Brown III and Stephen Starr dubai and abu dhabi: safer streets 1 - Put on Your Mask! In Dubai, United Arab Emirates, if you’re not wearing a mask and hear a low buzzing noise above your head, chances are you’re in trouble with the law. Police in the city have been using drones equipped with facial recognition capabilities and loudspeakers to dissuade locals from congregating in large numbers amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The drones reportedly detected 4,400 criminal violations, including 518 instances of people not wearing a mask, in the first three months of 2021. Among the other criminal activities recorded were sales of contraband goods, allowing law enforcement officers to make arrests without having to spend too much time patrolling some of the world’s hottest streets. 2 - ‘Emotion Recognition’ As a global crossroads for travel and trade of both legal and illicit stripes, border police in Abu Dhabi, Dubai’s neighboring city, face huge challenges in finding and stopping drug traffickers. But in November, three men were arrested for trafficking 100 pounds of heroin using Minority Report levels of AI. While details of the exact technologies used appear to be under wraps, “The dealers were caught using advanced policing techniques, including crime prediction and emotion recognition,” reports The National . The police force’s so-called Ghost AI system is also being deployed across the city in an attempt to predict what types of crimes will take place when and where. 3 - Police Cars With Facial Recognition Last year, Abu Dhabi equipped its already outlandish fleet of law enforcement vehicles with live biometric facial recognition systems , according to news reports. How does it work? A “smart bar” attached to the roof of a police car can identify the faces of known criminals, then interact with the city’s central police command system to check for outstanding warrants. But will the mass-tracing campaign impinge on the civil liberties of citizens? The UAE already has a questionable human rights record. Deploying AI in the law enforcement sphere could add to those concerns. real talk, real change It’s time for #RealTalkRealChange .

Learn More shenzhen: predicting pollution 1 - The Cost of Air Pollution It kills 7 million people around the globe every year. An estimated 1.24 million of those deaths occur in China , mainly in major cities. The huge growth in urban development across swaths of eastern and southern China has contributed enormously to the ill health not just of its residents, but also to the residents of other Asian countries. While air-monitoring systems have been around for years, China has been accused of misreporting air quality . 2 - Predicting Bad Air So what’s the solution? At the U.K.’s Loughborough University, researchers have built a program that can predict unhealthy levels of particulate smog in the air within hours by forecasting pollution events and their expected severity. Such advance notice is an urgent matter for vulnerable populations, with research showing that everything from coughs to cancer could begin with the ingestion of particulate matter. With the global urban population set to grow from 55% to 68% by 2030 , this technology could well be the canary in our planet’s coal mine. 3 - To Shenzhen Scientists who initially used air pollution levels in Beijing to “train” smog-monitoring AI are now looking at another Chinese city 1,300 miles to the south — Shenzhen — to see if it can be rolled out on a major scale. A coastal city of 13 million people, Shenzhen has suffered bad air for decades, though in recent years the city has tried to clean up its act . As the city that spearheaded China’s economic drive four decades ago, Shenzhen is set to lead the country again. Read More markham, ontario: spot that hole 1 - Pothole Predicaments As a suburb of Toronto, the fourth-largest city in North America, Markham’s roads see their fair share of vehicular traffic on top of winter wear and tear. The local climate — a freeze-thaw swing that occurs dozens of times each winter — is particularly damaging to roads and fuels a major pothole problem. Across the country, subpar road infrastructure costs motorists an estimated $2.4 billion every year in vehicle repairs and maintenance. Markham, with 343,000 people and with 684 miles of roads, has deployed artificial intelligence to locate potholes before they get bigger — and costlier to repair. 2 - The Solution The City of Markham created an AI-driven fix called ROVER. Cameras are attached to municipal vehicles. Potholes are identified and mapped using GPS. Not having to stop and mark each missing chunk of road or pavement by hand saves time, the City of Markham’s Alice Lam tells the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation , adding, “It also eliminates human error.” 3 - The Result The technology, now developed as an app, has increased pothole detection rates by 200% to 400%. After the succes of the pilot project, ROVER is now being used in five vehicles. With it gaining recognition among North America’s more clever infrastructure advances, you can expect to see similar efforts on your own streets in the near future. And that, for car and driver alike, can’t come soon enough. barcelona: artificial intelligence for all 1 - The Ethical Way In a place where AI and la bona vida are set to collide, city authorities in Barcelona are putting together a plan for machine learning that supports their own management needs while simultaneously respecting citizens’ digital rights . Spain’s second city is constructing an open source, public access AI system that makes available all algorithms that impact or involve its 1.6 million residents. To monitor beach occupancy amid the COVID-19 pandemic last summer, for instance, the city deployed thermal imaging systems instead of using controversial facial recognition systems. And instead of counting the number of people hitting the beaches, it estimates the total area of sand that is absent of people. 2 - Learning to Be Diverse You might not be surprised to hear that AI as a field lacks diversity . Women make up just 15% of AI researchers at Facebook and 10% at Google. Barcelona’s leading the way in trying to make the field more representative by making machine-learning tools available to anyone through an initiative called Saturdays.AI. Barcelona-based developer Jan Carbonell co-founded the company, which now offers educational programs in dozens of cities around the globe. 3 - Heavy Hitters Are Taking Note If you’re a country trying to level up in the AI playing field, it helps if you can pique the interest of giants. After Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez traveled to the West Coast of the United States and met with Apple CEO Tim Cook in July, it looks like the one-on-one time has paid off. Apple is set to expand its existing AI investment in Barcelona. The tech conglomerate has reportedly acquired a Barcelona-based AI company, Vilynx , which has created technology that could potentially be applied to Siri, Apple’s virtual assistant. Vilynx has made major advances in analyzing the audio, text and visual components of videos to identify their content. the global city: racist? 1 - Profiling For all its advantages, AI has a credibility problem and for good reason: It’s been shown to misidentify people of color. According to a 2019 study by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology, a plethora of top facial recognition algorithms suffer major inaccuracies when attempting to identify people based on characteristics such as race, ethnicity and age. Some systems deployed in the U.S. report a rate of misidentifying Black people five to 10 times more often than white people. In July, a Black teen in suburban Detroit was barred from a roller-skating rink after being misidentified by facial recognition software. And in January 2020 in Farmington Hills, Michigan, Robert Julian-Borchak Williams was incorrectly flagged by facial recognition technology as a shoplifting suspect and detained for 30 hours. 2 - ShotSpotter: Nothing to See Here, Folks ShotSpotter, a gunshot detection system that uses microphones in public spaces to locate and notify law enforcement officers of gunfire, has recently drawn its own fire. The system, used in dozens of cities across the U.S., has become known for frequent inaccuracies. In Chicago, 86% of ShotSpotter-prompted “gunfire” deployments turned out to be wild goose chases. More than 40,000 “dead-end deployments” to shooting alerts were registered between July 2019 and mid-April of this year. Activists argue that such tech tools are ineffective shortcuts rather than long-term changes that will reduce gun violence. 3 - The Answer Is Inclusion There’s a reason AI-based surveillance tech is often racially biased: It’s built on data drawn from discriminatory systems. It’s replete with systemic racism , even when it comes to something as simple as soap and hand sanitizer dispensers that darker-skinned hands don’t activate . Yet there are potential solutions. One is to establish inclusive AI design in which algorithms are actually tested on people from various races, cultures and genders. And another is to be aware of implicit bias that could be creeping into the algorithm. More on OZY Follow OZY on Twitter Why was there so little resistance when Afghanistan collapsed?

Martech startup Marpipe automates digital ad testing to tell marketers which are most effective. It just raised $8 million in Series A for a total of $10 million. The company shared the pitch deck it used to attract investors like Samsung and Math Capital. See more stories on Insider's business page . Marketing technology startup Marpipe just announced an $8 million Series A funding round for a total of $10 million raised to date. Part of the fast-growing creative software space, Marpipe automates the testing of hundreds of variations on Facebook and Instagram ads to tell marketers which are most effective. Founder and CEO Dan Pantelo said in his experience, around 90% of social media ad campaigns are shut down after one week or less due to underperformance. He said the ads' content is the biggest factor in their success but agency creatives often lack the data that could help them determine which version of an ad will perform best. ""Everything we do benefits from data science and automation except creative, which is the most important part of the whole puzzle,"" Pantelo said. ""It doesn't matter what creatives or clients think looks good; all that matters is what consumers want to see and hear from us."" Pantelo said he initially approached several ad-focused VC funds like Math Capital, which came together on a pre-seed round. The latest fundraising round was part of Marpipe's effort to get out in front of a growing field that includes platforms like Smartly.io , Celtra , and VidMob . Below are key slides from the investor pitch deck Marpipe used to raise the Series A. Marpipe asks potential investors if any of their portfolio companies struggle to create effective ad campaigns. Marpipe Marpipe says its technology can help resolve the tension between marketers who want better ads and creatives who lack the tools to test their work at scale. Marpipe Marpipe's key selling point is the data collected from consumers' responses to hundreds of different ads. Marpipe After years of focusing on ad-buying and selling software, investors have begun pouring money into design platforms. Marpipe New data privacy regulations have created an opening for companies like Marpipe that focus on the ads themselves rather than targeting technology, said investor Brandon Hoffman of Samsung Next. Marpipe Creative software companies like Smartly.io and VidMob have raised millions and attracted M&A interest, but Marpipe says no clear leader has emerged. Marpipe The company works with Facebook and Instagram and wants to sign deals with other ad platforms like Adobe and The Trade Desk. Marpipe Marpipe's primary focus will be growing its engineering team. Marpipe The company plans to move into video and audio ads and expand its data services.

As demand for digital training solutions explodes, many learning technology companies are reporting 50 per cent growth in a market estimated to be worth $25B by 2025. LearnExperts will use this investment to accelerate their market lead within the sector. After 20 years working at technology companies such as Cognos, IBM, PTC, and Kinaxis, LearnExperts founder Sarah Sedgman decided in 2019 to leave the comforts of corporate life and fulfill a mission to disrupt the learning technology space. “Years ago, when I was head of course development, I received a call from the CEO who needed my help because we were acquiring customers and releasing new features quickly, but our training lagged six to nine months after product release, which meant we couldn’t train our customers fast enough to get immediate value from our software and we risked losing them as customers,” said Sedgman. While she was able to reengineer the course development process to ensure launch alongside the product release, which had a positive impact on customers, it was still a manual process and very time-consuming, taking months to develop the content and release the courses. Sedgman’s experiences led to the development of a digital course creation platform that automatically transforms existing content into a course. LearnExperts guides the user to create a complete course with best practices applied through proprietary artificial intelligence. Starting with existing content that wasn’t purpose-built for learning, the output is a consistent, ready-to-use course that looks just like an expert built it. LearnExperts cuts the time to create and launch a new course from months to days. Story continues “We saw the value in LearnExperts immediately and knew that we wanted to be the lead investor,” said Ryan Henry, Partner at Sand Hill North. “We look for innovative technology companies that are reshaping the future of work for the better. The LearnExperts platform saves course creators days of effort and empowers them to easily build high-quality consistent courses.” LearnExperts Secures Large Enterprise Customers within First Year When LearnExperts began demonstrations of the platform, the interest was overwhelming, and customers wanted the solution right away. Originally planning to bootstrap the business, Sedgman decided to accelerate and raise capital. Now, the company is backed by an oversubscribed investment round and achieving steady customer acquisition. “We were impressed by the team’s deep domain expertise coupled with a unique solution to address the challenge of developing content at a rapid pace,” said Kevin Madill, Investment Director, MaRS IAF. “We are excited to participate in this latest funding round, support the team, and be part of the LearnExperts journey.” “What I love about Sarah is her passion, her thought leadership and energy. What I love about her and her team is that they’ve done this before within large technology corporations,” said Julia Elvidge, board member for Capital Angel Network. “We are excited to support LearnExperts and believe they have the right solution at the right time to deliver differentiated value to large companies around the world.” “I have been selling software solutions for many years and when I met Sarah and her team, I saw a large opportunity for their platform to provide immediate value in an exploding market,” said Jim Brown, active Georgian Angel Network investor. “Their system is unique and their go to market strategy is strong, and I look forward to partnering alongside Sarah and her team with any advice needed.” “I want to thank the Canadian Investor Community, Invest Ottawa, and several industry experts for the tremendous support,” said Sedgman. “Our investors Sand Hill North, MaRS IAF, Capital Angel Network, Maple Leaf Angel Network, Georgian Angel Network and the independent investors are strategic, savvy investors and have already become great partners.” Learn more at LearnExperts.ai .

Machine learning is very effective for making predictions or calculating suggestions based on vast quantities of data, which is the trendiest topic in the tech sector right now. In this article, we will discuss the top 10 ML algorithms for newbies. What are machine learning algorithms? Any other algorithm in computer programming can be connected to a machine learning method. An ML algorithm is a data-driven process for developing a production-ready ML model. If you consider ML as a train that will get you to your destination, then ML algorithms are the engines that will get you there. The sort of ML algorithm that works best is determined by the business challenge at hand, the dataset’s structure, and the available resources. Types of Machine Learning Algorithms Supervised ML Algorithms Unsupervised ML Algorithms Reinforcement ML Algorithms Best ML Algorithms Decision Tree The decision tree is a decision-making aid that employs a tree-like graph or model of options, as well as their potential consequences, such as chance-event results, resource costs, and execution. Decision trees are the top pick for categorizing both categorical and continuous dependent variables since they are supervised learning algorithms. The population is divided into two or more homogenous datasets using the most significant features or independent variables in this technique. Principal Component Analysis When data contains several dimensions, dimension reduction methods are among the most essential algorithms in ML. Consider a dataset with “n” dimensions, such as a data profession list that works with financial data with features such as credit score, personal information, staff compensation, and so on. He or she may now utilize the dimensionality reduction approach to identify the relevant labels for creating the needed model, and PCA is the ideal algorithm for decreasing dimensions. Deep Learning Algorithms Deep learning algorithms are based on the neurological system of a person and are usually built on neural networks that have a lot of computing power. To execute certain tasks, all of these algorithms employ various forms of neural networks. Deep learning algorithms are frequently used in areas such as healthcare, entertainment, eCommerce, and advertising to training computers by learning from instances. Naive Bayes Classifier The occurrence of a selected feature in a class is unrelated to the appearance of any other feature, according to a Naive Bayes classifier. Even though one attribute is connected to the others, it considers all of them independent when computing the likelihood of a specific result. There are two sorts of probability in the model: Probability of each class Conditional Probability Both probabilities may be computed directly from training data, and the probability model can then be used to forecast fresh data using the Bayes Theorem. Ordinary Least Square Regression The least-square is the technique for doing linear regression in statistics. The traditional least-squares approach is to draw a clear line between an independent variable and a dependent variable, then compute the vertical distance between the spot and the line for each data set, and add them up. Linear Regression Linear regression describes the effect on the dependent variable when the independent variable is changed; as a result, the independent variable is referred to as the explained variable, and the dependent variable is referred to as the factor of interest. It depicts the relationship between an independent and a dependent variable, as well as predictions and estimates in continuous values. It may be used, for example, in the insurance industry to assess risk and determine the number of applications for users of various ages. Logistic Regression A useful statistical method for modeling a binomial output including one or more explanatory factors is logistic regression. It calculates the relationship between the categorical dependent variable and one or even more independent variables by using a logistic function to measure probabilities. The logistic regression algorithm works with discrete data and is ideally suited to classification models, where an event is categorized as 1 if it happens successfully and 0 if it does not. As a result, the likelihood of a given event occurring is calculated using the specified predictor factors. Support Vector Machines In SVM, a hyperplane is used to correctly divide the data points throughout the input variable space by their corresponding class, which is either 0 or 1. Essentially, the SVM method calculates the coefficients that result in a reasonable separation of the different classes through the hyperplane, with the margin referring to the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points. The line with the biggest margin, on the other hand, is the best hyperplane for separating the two classes. Clustering Algorithms Clustering is a data analysis method of finding meaningful data patterns, such as groupings of consumers based on their behavior or geography, because it is an unsupervised learning issue. Clustering algorithms relate to the job of grouping an assemblage of items in such a manner that each entity in the same group is more similar to each other than those in different groups. Gradient Boosting & AdaBoost When dealing with large amounts of data, boosting algorithms are employed to make very accurate predictions. It is an ensemble learning method that mixes the different susceptible and mediocre predictors to produce strong predictors or estimators by combining the predictive power of varied base estimators in order to improve resilience. Conclusion Machine learning algorithms assist automate manual processes to make our lives easier, from simple day-to-day operations to making systems smarter. Machine learning’s importance has increased even more, which is why eager data scientists and engineers are eager to acquire new approaches to improve their abilities.

Register here The Transform Technology Summits start October 13th with Low-Code/No Code: Enabling Enterprise Agility. Register now! Google today announced TensorFlow Similarity, a Python package designed to train similarity models with the company’s TensorFlow machine learning framework. Similarity models search for related items, for example finding similar-looking clothes and identifying currently playing songs. As Google explains, many similarity models are trained using a technique called contrastive learning. Contrastive learning, in turn, relies on clustering algorithms, which automatically identify patterns in data by operating on the theory that data points in groups should have similar features. Contrastive learning allows a model to project items into an “embedding space” when applied to a dataset, such that the distances between embeddings — mathematical representations of the items — are indicative of how similar the input examples are. Training with TensorFlow Similarity yields a space where the distance between similar items remains small while the distance between dissimilar items is large. For instance, training a similarity model on the Oxford-IIIT Pet dataset leads to clusters where similar-looking breeds are close by and cats and dogs are separated. Training similarity models Once a model is trained, TensorFlow Similarity builds an index that contains the embeddings of the various items to make them searchable. According to Google, the library enables searches over millions of indexed items, retrieving the top similar matches within a fraction of second. Moreover, TensorFlow Similarity can add an unlimited new number of classes to the index without having to retrain, instead computing only the embeddings for representative items of the new classes. While the initial release of the library is focused on providing components to build contrastive learning-based similarity models, Google says it’ll add support for additional types of models to TensorFlow Similarity in the future. “The ability to search for related items has many real world applications,” Google’s Elie Bursztein and Owen S. Vallis wrote in a blog post. “More generally, being able to quickly retrieve related items is a vital part of many core information systems such as multimedia searches, recommender systems, and clustering pipelines.” TensorFlow Similarity is available in open source via GitHub. In addition, Google has released a programming notebook with a tutorial on basic usage. The release of TensorFlow Similarity follows the launches of other TensorFlow extensions focused on particular kinds of models and use cases. In 2019, Google debuted TensorFlow Privacy , a library intended to make it easier for developers to train AI models with “strong privacy guarantees.” And last year, the company released an experimental module that tests the security of AI models.

(Photo Illustration by Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images Roku stock (NASDAQ NDAQ : ROKU) dropped almost 16% in the last one month and now trades at under $320 per share. The company’s shares tumbled following the Q2 2021 financial results in early August, as investors became concerned about a sequential dip in usage and a warning that margins will come under pressure as supply chain constraints and cost increases eat into its bottom-line performance for the next couple of quarters. Streaming hours in Q2 2021 were at 17.4 billion, marking a decrease of 1 billion hours from Q1 2021. This was mainly because of more people venturing out as the Covid-19 crisis seemed to be initially subsiding Q2, before the Delta variant surge brought many back to home confinement. After the results, a couple of analysts downgraded the target price for Roku. Initially the stock was also affected as Cathie Wood, the founder and CEO of ARK Investment Management PZN , sold Roku shares from ARK?s exchange-traded funds. Wood had off loaded half a million shares of Roku since the end of June 2021, with total sales amounting close to $239 million. This sale assumed significance as just a month before it, Wood had said that investors were making a mistake by selling so-called stay-at-home stocks like Roku. But, after the recent decline, will ROKU’s stock continue its downward trajectory over the coming weeks, or is a recovery in the stock more likely? According to the Trefis Machine Learning Engine, which identifies trends in a company’s stock price data for the last four years, returns for ROKU stock average more than 14% in the next one-month (21 trading days) period after experiencing a 16% fall over the previous one-month (21 trading days) period. Also, there is a 66.5% probability that the stock will give a positive return in the next one month. But how would these numbers change if you are interested in holding ROKU stock for a shorter or a longer time period? You can test the answer and many other combinations on the Trefis Machine Learning Engine to test ROKU stock chances of a rise after a fall and vice versa. You can test the chance of recovery over different time intervals of a quarter, month, or even just one day! MACHINE LEARNING ENGINE try it yourself: IF ROKU stock moved by -5% over five trading days, THEN over the next 21 trading days, ROKU stock moves an average of 10 percent. Also, there is a 56% chance that the stock will give positive return in the next one month following a 5% drop over the previous week. Roku stock Trefis Some Fun Scenarios, FAQs & Making Sense of ROKU Stock Movements: Question 1: Is the average return for Roku stock higher after a drop? MORE FOR YOU War With China? The Economic Factor That Could Trigger It These Are The ‘Altcoins’ Everyone Loves Right Now Is Ethereum’s DeFi Boom Setting Itself Up For DeFi Bust? Answer: Consider two situations, Case 1: Roku stock drops by -5% or more in a week Case 2: Roku stock rises by 5% or more in a week Is the average return for Roku stock higher over the subsequent month after Case 1 or Case 2? ROKU stock fares better after Case 1 , with an average return of 9.9% over the next month (21 trading days) under Case 1 (where the stock has just suffered a 5% loss over the previous week), versus, an average return of 7.8% for Case 2. In comparison, the S&P 500 has an average return of 3.1% over the next 21 trading days under Case 1, and an average return of just 0.5% for Case 2 as detailed in our dashboard that details the average return for the S&P 500 after a fall or rise . Try the Trefis machine learning engine above to see for yourself how Roku stock is likely to behave after any specific gain or loss over a period. Question 2: Does patience pay? Answer: If you buy and hold Roku stock, the expectation is over time the near-term fluctuations will cancel out, and the long-term positive trend will favor you - at least if the company is otherwise strong. Overall, according to data and Trefis machine learning engine’s calculations, patience absolutely pays for most stocks! For ROKU stock, the returns over the next N days after a -5% change over the last five trading days is detailed in the table below, along with the returns for the S&P500: Question 3: What about the average return after a rise if you wait for a while? Answer: The average return after a rise is understandably lower than after a fall as detailed in the previous question. Interestingly, though, if a stock has gained over the last few days, you would do better to avoid short-term bets for most stocks - although ROKU stock appears to be an exception to this general observation. ROKU’s returns over the next N days after a 5% change over the last five trading days is detailed in the table below, along with the returns for the S&P500: It’s pretty powerful to test the trend for yourself for Roku stock by changing the inputs in the charts above.

The impacts could be mitigated by module recycling, repair and reuse; however, previous studies of PV circularity omit the consideration of critical social factors. Here we used an agent-based model to integrate social aspects with techno-economic factors, which provides a more realistic assessment of the circularity potential for previously studied interventions that assesses additional interventions that cannot be analysed using techno-economic analysis alone. We also performed a global sensitivity analysis using a machine-learning metamodel. We show that to exclude social factors underestimates the effect of lower recycling prices on PV material circularity, which highlights the relevance of considering social factors in future studies. Interventions aimed at changing customer attitudes about used PV boost the reuse of modules, although used modules can only satisfy one-third of the US demand during 2020–2050, which suggests that reuse should be complemented by recycling. Download PDF Main Soaring global deployment of solar photovoltaics (PV) could mitigate problems related to energy generation, but may exacerbate other issues. PV manufacturing depletes scarce resources, such as silver, tellurium and copper 1 , 2 . For instance, silver production could peak by 2030, with a risk of demand outstripping supply around 2075 3 . Although minerals and metals are essential for the transition to a low-carbon society, increased use could aggravate social and ecological problems 4 . Large-scale PV deployment also will produce substantial amounts of end-of-life (EOL) PV materials. By 2050, a cumulative 80 Mt of PV modules are expected to reach EOL globally, with 10 Mt in the United States alone 5 . Outcomes associated with increased PV deployment depend on the economic approach applied. In today’s predominantly linear economy, resources are extracted to manufacture goods, which are later discarded. The alternative circular economy (CE) model could mitigate resource and ecological challenges 6 by encouraging dematerialization and the recovery and reuse of products and materials 6 , 7 . Challenges to a PV CE include low recycling rates 3 , 8 , non-specialized PV recycling 9 , which results in low material recovery rates and profits 8 , difficult separation of module components 3 and product reuse limited by consumer awareness and attitude towards used products as well as to the current policy 10 . Adopting a social viewpoint to complement other perspectives could increase the effectiveness of circularity-promoting interventions. Social behaviours could play a critical role in developing secondary PV markets and managing EOL PV, because psychological and behavioural traits often undermine the viability of technical solutions 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 . Sovacool and Griffiths, for instance, report that culturally rooted driving behaviours influence the adoption of fuel-efficient vehicles and ride-sharing services 14 . However, current studies of material circularity (that is, the degree to which materials are recirculated in the economy) are limited to the technical and economic material efficiency potentials and do not account for consumer behaviour 13 , 15 . This assessment means that major changes in the way CE is analysed need to be undertaken 12 , 16 , 17 . We help fill this gap by incorporating social considerations into an exploration of the techno-economic, market and policy conditions that may improve the material circularity of the dominant crystalline-silicon (c-Si) PV module technology. We applied an agent-based model (ABM) to represent multiple actors involved with the PV life cycle as well as social factors (attitude and peer influence) that constrain CE strategies, and built a machine-learning (ML) metamodel (that is, a model of a model) to conduct a global sensitivity analysis. An ABM is well-suited to a study of the CE transition because it considers temporal aspects, adopts a systemic view, accounts for human decisions and interactions between actors 16 , and exploits recent advances in behavioural economics and psychology 16 , 18 , 19 , 20 . ABMs are used to study CE scenarios in relation to waste management 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , but no previous model has included secondary market dynamics that underlie the reuse CE strategy. Many ABM studies have addressed PV adoption 19 , but the method has not been used to investigate renewable technologies through EOL. By integrating social considerations, we not only analyse the factors that affect PV CE scenarios more comprehensively than previous studies have, but we also explore types of CE interventions—such as strengthening warranties for used PV modules and ‘seeding’ used modules to encourage secondary-market development—that cannot be assessed using techno-economic analysis alone. The result is a fuller picture of the options available to promote PV circularity and a fuller picture of the potential effectiveness of those options separately and in combination. However, given the exploratory nature of our work, the results should be viewed as estimates of how CE principles could affect EOL management of PV modules in the future, rather than robust predictions. ABM of PV circularity In our ABM, four types of agents (PV owners, installers, recyclers and manufacturers) and five EOL management options (repair, reuse, recycling, landfilling and storage) are defined (Supplementary Fig. 1 ), with a focus on CE strategies that have been proposed by stakeholders as likely to contribute most to the CE in the future 25 . Landfilling and storage are included because those options are reported in the United States 26 , 27 . Two purchasing options are also modelled: the purchase of new or of used PV modules. For each type of agent, behavioural rules are defined to model the adoption of CE strategies. For instance, for PV owners, the ABM projects the cumulative amount of PV modules in use as well as the waste generated at their EOL. Then, the PV owner agents make decisions about whether to comply with a particular CE strategy according to the theory of planned behaviour (TPB), which is one of the most influential theories used to explain human behaviour 13 and accounts for various factors that affect human decisions, such as economics and peer influence. Details are presented in Methods and Supplementary Table 1 . Our ABM simulates the current US conditions, although changing several rules and other parameters would enable it to simulate EOL decisions for PV modules anywhere in the world. The European Union, where PV modules must be recycled at the EOL based on waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) regulations, is the most constrained region because only a few pathways are allowed. The United States is projected to have the second-largest amount of EOL modules by 2050 5 , and landfilling is considerably cheaper than recycling 26 . In this challenging environment for a PV CE, it is vital to identify the most effective and cost-efficient strategies or combinations of strategies to improve material circularity. To do so, we assessed not only the fraction of EOL mass that avoids being landfilled (and stored), but also societal costs (that is, the net costs of manufacturers, recyclers and installers) and recyclers and installers net revenue, because these metrics are relevant to assuring the sustainability of the CE. The dynamic factors considered include the PV module failure rate and the learning effect for module recycling—that is, the decrease in recycling costs with increasing recycled volumes due to factors such as economies of scale and technological advancement 28 . Our ABM is also stochastic to account for variability in some parameters, such as landfill costs, and to enable advanced sensitivity and uncertainty analysis (Supplementary Table 1 ). We ran 30 simulations for each scenario from 2020 to 2050 and present the means in this article; we selected the number of simulations based on a stability analysis reported in Supplementary Fig. 2 . The ABM differs from similar waste-management models as it includes decisions related to the demand and supply sides of reuse, accounts for technical factors, such as the recycling learning effect, and extends the reported metrics 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 . Our approach also differs from current literature on PV EOL management in that behavioural aspects are captured to better characterize the CE transition. We start by providing an overview of CE scenarios, and show that many interventions besides regulations could promote circularity (Fig. 1 , Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4 ). In the subsequent sections, we further explore several of the interventions from Fig. 1 . Fig. 1: Various interventions could improve material circularity in the PV sector. a – i , Landfill ban ( a ), high material recovery (96%) and US $18 per module recycling costs ( b ), lower recycling costs (US $18 per module) ( c ), higher landfill costs (US $2.75 per module) ( d ), improved learning (from 30 to 60 yr in 2050) ( e ), improved learning effect (learning parameter = 0.6) ( f ), reuse warranties (equal new/used attitude) ( g ), seeding reuse (5% of population per year) ( h ) and baseline ( i ). Some interventions, which include improved warranties ( g ) and seeding used modules ( h ), particularly boost module repair and reuse. Other interventions, such as lower initial recycling costs ( c ) and higher landfill costs ( d ), boost recycling. Full size image The baseline scenario reflects the current US conditions, calibrated to the available evidence (through iterations of full factorial experiments, the unknown PV owners’ attitudes towards CE behaviours were set to values that reproduced today’s low recycling and reuse rates 8 , 29 ). The baseline scenario also reproduces projected cumulative PV capacity and EOL modules based on the literature 5 . In this scenario, 500 GW of PV will be installed in the United States between 2020 and 2050, which generate 9.1 Mt of PV waste during the same period (Supplementary Fig. 5 ). The average initial recycling costs are US $28 per module, the average repair costs are US $65 per module, the used module prices are 36% of the new module prices on average and the average landfill costs are US $1.38 per module (Supplementary Table 1 ). In this scenario, most modules are landfilled (83%), with 1.2% reused and 9.5% recycled (here, the percentages are mass fractions of the total generated waste). Only 80% of a given module’s materials is recovered through recycling in the baseline scenario, because the assumed recycling process entails simple mechanical separation, which recovers only the aluminium frame and glass sheets from EOL modules 9 . Thus, the material recycling rate is 7.7%, equivalent to 0.7 Mt cumulatively through to 2050 (Fig. 1i ). In the following, we express all the EOL rates as the mass percentage of materials and represent cumulative amounts in 2050 unless otherwise specified. In this baseline scenario, recycling is not profitable in any year, even when the learning effect and the revenue from recovered materials is accounted for, so PV owners must pay a recycling fee (Supplementary Fig. 5 ). Techno-economic interventions could improve PV materials circularity. Research and development in recycling technologies could yield lower costs (Fig. 1c ), better performance or both (Fig. 1b,f ). Research and development to improve module durability would lower the amount of PV EOL materials generated (Fig. 1e ). Market interventions, such as better warranties for recovered modules (Fig. 1g ), higher landfill costs (Fig. 1d ), ‘seeding’ of used modules to encourage secondary market development (Fig. 1h ) and existing regulatory policies, such as a landfill ban 11 (Fig. 1a ) could also increase circularity. We also examined two existing business models of PV module manufacturers: extended producer responsibility and waste-generator responsibility (Supplementary Fig. 6 ). In Fig. 1 , the reuse of EOL PV modules is limited by customer willingness to purchase used modules, which explains the circularity rate decline around 2035 in some scenarios, as EOL PV modules move from the reuse pathway to other EOL pathways. Although the simulations start in 2020, the generation of EOL PV modules is assumed to start from modules installed in 2000. Effect of lower recycling costs on the recycling rate One barrier to recycling EOL PV modules is the lack of profitability 11 , 26 , 30 . Module materials are difficult to separate and, for the most part, have low values 30 . For example, silver accounts for half of the material value but represents less than 1% of the module mass 5 . Thus, recycling costs are not offset by revenues from recovered materials in the current simple mechanical processes of glass and metal recyclers in the United States, which leads to recycling fees of US $25–30 per module that PV owners or installers must bear in the absence of enhanced product responsibility or take-back programmes 26 . Some states, such as Maryland and Washington, have proposed tax incentives to overcome this issue 31 , 32 . Figure 2a (blue line with circles) shows the effect of varying the initial (year 1) recycling costs in the ABM. The percentage of recycled EOL modules increases steeply with the falling initial recycling costs before it plateaus and reaches 73% recovery at zero cost. The plateau is due to several factors: part of the materials from recycled modules is still landfilled (for example, silicon), for some PV owners storage costs are null, so storage competes with free recycling and some cliques of agents reinforce each other into non-recycling behaviours through peer influence (these agents are tightly connected in the social network and therefore strongly influence each other’s decisions). Owing to the learning effect (Fig. 2b ), recycling is profitable by 2050 for each value of the initial recycling costs below US $21 per module (Fig. 2a , red line with circle markers). With the current PV installed capacity and volumes of EOL modules, module recycling can still be considered in its infancy, and the learning effect will probably drive recycling costs down during 2020–2050. For instance, at an initial recycling cost of US $18 per module (similar to the processing costs of high-recovery mechanical processes reported in the literature 30 ) instead of US $28 per module in the baseline scenario, the recycling rate increases from 7.7 to 44% (or 4.0 Mt) in 2050 (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 3 ). With the learning effect, this initial recycling cost enables recycling to be profitable by 2050 with a net income of US $0.09 kg –1 . The material recycling rate is also higher when recycling processes recover more materials, for example, with the full-recovery end-of-life photovoltaic (FRELP) process. In this process, 94% of the silver and 97% of the silicon in c-Si PV modules are recovered 26 , which greatly enhances the value of the recovered materials (Fig. 3a , blue lines, and Supplementary Fig. 4 ). Fig. 2: The influence of recycling costs on the material recycling rate. a , In the baseline scenario, the volume of materials recycled (cumulative total in 2050) quickly increases with falling initial recycling costs until it reaches a plateau. Not accounting for economic factors (costs of recycling for PV owners) and social factors (attitude and peer influence) misrepresents the effect of lower initial recycling costs on the volume of materials recycled. Recycling is profitable (provides negative net costs, that is, recycling costs minus value of recovered materials) by 2050 for initial recycling costs of US $21 per module or less (black dashed line). Shaded areas represent 95% confidence intervals, blue and red lines correspond to the left and right y axes, respectively. b , Recycling costs (without accounting for the value of recovered materials) decrease with the amount of PV modules being recycled. Shaded areas represent 95% confidence intervals, blue and red lines correspond to the left and right y axes, respectively (see Supplementary Fig. 7 for a y axis in US $ kg –1 ). c , High initial subsidies (initial recycling costs of US $10 per module, yellow) boost recycling and help recyclers be profitable (due to the learning effect) more quickly than low subsidies do (initial recycling costs of US $18 per module, green), which results in lower overall costs for the subsidy provider (US $16 million per year instead of US $56 million per year to reach a 40% recycling rate). Full size image Fig. 3: The effect of the material recovery rate and initial recycling costs on material circularity and recyclers’ net income. a , Cumulative materials from EOL PV modules and recycler net income assuming the use of the FRELP process and an initial recycling cost of US $18 per module; in this scenario, the recycler cumulative net income reaches US $1.6 billion and the net income is US $0.42 kg –1 in 2050. b , Cumulative recovered material value in 2050 as a function of the material recovery rate and initial recycling costs; high materials recovery and low initial recycling costs have a synergistic effect on value generation. Full size image When costs alone are included in the model, the recycling rate is always null as long as recycling is more expensive than landfilling (that is, when the initial recycling costs are above US $3 per module)—see the ‘No social factors’ line in Fig. 2a . However, when social factors that influence the PV owner decisions, such as peer influence and attitude towards recycling, are included, the recycling rate increases with falling recycling costs. When social factors alone are included (the ‘No costs factors’ line in Fig. 2a ), the recycling rate is overestimated or underestimated. These results demonstrate the relevance of accounting for social aspects in the techno-economic analysis, because they may explain how and why a technology or behaviour is adopted. In our case study, the positive effect of social factors on circularity when the initial recycling costs are high shows the potential importance of nurturing early adopters of recycling behaviours who create a trend for other PV owners to follow. One strategy to increase recycling is to provide a subsidy until the recycling rate target is achieved. Our simulations indicate that a larger initial subsidy can be less costly than a smaller subsidy, because it engages more PV owners to recycle earlier (Fig. 2c ). Moreover, the learning effect supports recycling behaviours by lowering costs further, which leads to more PV owners adopting the recycling pathway. Overall, if the stream of EOL modules that reaches recyclers keeps increasing (which is likely), the learning effect could spur profitable recycling without subsidies. In our simulations, a 20% recycling target can be reached earlier with an US $18 per module subsidy (12 years) than with a US $10 per module subsidy (18 years), which limits the period over which subsidies must be provided. The simulations show that a yearly recycled volume above 15,000 t of EOL modules could make recycling profitable owing to the learning effect, a threshold value in line with the literature 33 . High subsidies to encourage recycling and exploit the learning effect are a relevant strategy, but the results depend strongly on the presence of a sufficient learning effect. Thus, a subsidy programme could benefit from establishing performance targets that verify the continuous improvement of recycling processes, which ensures that recycling costs do not return to original levels once subsidies stop. Economic benefits of a higher material recovery Recycling profitability could be increased through research and development in technologies that enable the recovery of more valuable materials—such as silver, copper and silicon—from EOL modules. High-recovery mechanical processes can enable a higher material recovery, up to 97% of the total mass using the FRELP process 26 ; however, in contrast with thermal recycling processes, such mechanical processes typically recover lower-quality materials with less value and usefulness than they had in the original module 3 . Figure 3a shows shares of modules in each EOL pathway and recycler net income assuming materials recovery fractions from the FRELP process 26 and an initial recycling cost of US $18 per module 30 . FRELP recovers 20% more materials per module than that in the baseline scenario and substantially increases the recovered material value owing to the silver and silicon recovery (Supplementary Table 1 ). This economic benefit is likely to weaken in the future, however, as innovation causes silver and silicon to constitute progressively smaller mass fractions in c-Si PV modules 5 ; our analysis does not consider this trend because of the high associated uncertainty. Recycler cumulative net income in 2050 increases from US $296 million in the simple mechanical process scenario to US $1.6 billion in the FRELP scenario. Moreover, recycling becomes profitable earlier (2032 instead of 2037), with recycler net income reaching US $0.42 kg –1 in 2050 (the dip in recycler net income in Fig. 3a (blue lines) is due to initially unprofitable recycling). Figure 3b shows the synergistic effect on the recovered material value of lower initial recycling costs (which spur recycling among PV owners) and higher total material recovery fractions. For instance, at an initial recycling cost of US $16 per module, a 13% increase from an 80% material recovery fraction roughly doubles the recovered material value. The synergy between the two factors diminishes as the initial recycling costs are very high or very low. Our simulations also show that some EOL modules are stored for a short period, which leads to the small, relatively constant share of stored modules in Fig. 3a (purple wedge) as PV owners and installers wait for cheaper and more accessible recycling options or the accumulation of quantities that are more economical to ship and recycle 26 . Strategies to improve PV module reuse Improved warranties for used modules could promote secondary markets 11 . The reuse rate increases from 1.2 to 23% (by 2.1 Mt) when it is assumed that warranties give PV owners an equivalent attitude towards used and new modules 10 (Figs. 1g and 4a ). However, this assumption also decreases the recycling rate from 7.7% to less than 1%. Figure 4b shows that a 23% reuse rate (that is, the result from Fig. 4a ) only covers a small portion of projected PV demand. Even with an ambitious 89% reuse rate—set by removing all the constraints to reuse except that modules can only be reused once in the ABM—only one-third of PV demand is met with used modules, which highlights the reuse strategy’s limitation. This result is explained by the projected growth of PV demand and the imperfect substitution of used modules for new modules (due to a lower power efficiency and lifetime 34 ) (see Supplementary Table 1 ). Once reused, modules still must be managed at the end of their second life, so developing other circular pathways, such as recycling or lifetime extension, is critical. Fig. 4: Reuse rate under different scenarios and the resulting displacement of new modules. a , Cumulative materials from EOL PV modules and installer net income assuming that improved warranties give PV owners an equivalent attitude towards used and new modules shows substantial module reuse. Installer cumulative net income is US $3.5 billion and net income is US $2.2 kg –1 in 2050. After 2025, the net income per module decreases as innovation reduces the PV module costs. b , Cumulative installed capacities of used (brown) and new (blue) modules in 2050 for various reuse rates obtained with our simulations; red diamonds (correspond to the right y axis) represent the average fraction of used modules. In an ideal reuse case (the 89% reuse bars), modules landfilled after their second life represent almost 10% of the cumulative EOL PV modules in 2050. Error bars are 95% confidence intervals. Full size image In practice, improved warranties may be insufficient to improve PV owner attitudes towards used modules, because other factors, such as safety concerns or aesthetic preferences, may intervene. Thus, other strategies to promote secondary markets should be considered. For instance, short-term ‘seeding’—providing free modules and installation to some PV owners—has proved to be an effective strategy 35 that could develop secondary markets for PV through the peer effect (Fig. 1h ). Such a seeding strategy applied to 5.0% of PV owners (that is, at least 5.0% of PV owners have used modules each year) enhances the reuse rate from 1.2 to 6.9% but lowers the recycling rate from 7.7 to 4.8% (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 3 ). A similar strategy, in which 10% of PV owners pay a lower initial recycling fee (US $18 per module), increases the material recycling rate to 21% (Supplementary Fig. 8 ). Sensitivity analysis and combined interventions We used a ML metamodel of the ABM to conduct a variance-based sensitivity analysis and explore the ABM parameter space at a higher speed. In this approach, the ABM is used to generate both the training and cross-validation data of the ML metamodel, whereas the latter provides expected outputs of the ABM for a given parameter combination. Figure 5 presents the first- and total-order Sobol indices (which measure the main effects and interaction effects, respectively) for some parameters that underlie the techno-economic and social interventions presented thus far. Initial recycling costs, landfill costs and the learning effect are most important to the module circularity rate, with contributions of 48, 33 and 4% to the total variance in results, respectively (Supplementary Table 3 ). The attitude towards used modules has a smaller but notable effect. Although some parameters present higher-order effects, the parameters rank similarly. However, the rankings change when examining output metrics other than the material circularity rate, such as the reuse rate or societal costs (Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Figs. 9 – 11 ). Finally, notable second-order interactions exist between the initial recycling costs and other parameters (Supplementary Table 4 ). Fig. 5: Parameter importance for EOL PV module circularity in the ABM. Categorical parameters, such as the landfill ban, are excluded. The y axis shows the first- and total-order Sobol indices on the effect of a parameter on the EOL PV module circularity. Error bars are 95% confidence intervals. Full size image Figure 6 presents the interaction effects between the initial recycling costs and four other parameters: landfill cost, attitude towards used modules, learning parameter and number of recycling facilities. Increments of the landfill cost and learning parameter boost the effect of decreasing the initial recycling costs on the material circularity (Figs. 6a,c , respectively). For instance, with initial recycling costs of US $10 per module, raising the landfill cost from US $1.38 to 2.76 per module increases the material circularity rate from about 60 to 70% (Fig. 6a ). As the reuse and recycling pathways compete, combining a more positive attitude towards used modules with lower recycling costs does not enhance the volume of PV materials diverted from landfills and storage (Fig. 6b ). Transportation costs are negligible compared with recycling costs, so having fewer facilities increases the material circularity rate slightly owing to an enhanced learning effect (Fig. 6d ). Finally, as with the sensitivity indices (Fig. 5 ), the results are different when examining other output metrics (Supplementary Figs. 12 and 13 ). Fig. 6: Fractions of PV module materials in circular pathways in 2050 as a function of the initial recycling costs. a – d , Landfill costs ( a ), attitude towards used modules ( b ), learning effect parameter ( c ) and number of recycling facilities ( d ). Full size image Figure 6 also highlights that different intervention combinations may yield the same results (that is, equifinality). For instance, initial recycling costs of US $18 per module combined with landfill costs of US $2 per module yield a 45% circularity rate, as do initial recycling costs of US $13 per module combined with 48 recycling facilities. Using the ML metamodel, we designed an experiment to identify the parameter combinations that maximize the circularity rate while minimizing societal costs (Supplementary Table 5 ). Overall, combining low recycling costs, high landfill costs and a high learning effect yields the best result in the ABM, which suggests that combining interventions might be the most promising strategy to increase PV circularity at the lowest costs. Discussion Our results should be understood as estimates of how applying CE principles could affect the EOL management of PV modules, and not as robust predictions. The ABM uses various sources as inputs, which include some outside the PV sector (for example, electronic waste literature) owing to the limited availability of primary data. For instance, the initial recycling and reuse rates are dated to 2016, and more recent estimates could yield slightly different results. Moreover, as some data variability is unknown, we approximate it using probability distributions, which adds uncertainty to the results (Supplementary Table 1 ). In practice, there are regional geopolitical and demographic differences, which could lead to various degrees of adoption of CE practices. Although we use the TPB to better represent human decisions related to EOL management, factors not included in the theory may affect stakeholder decisions. The parameters of the TPB model were also taken from a meta-analysis on recycling behaviours, which may not directly apply to the PV context (Supplementary Table 6 ). In addition, we simplify stakeholders as constituting four broad categories (PV owners, installers, recyclers and manufacturers); in the real world, the decisions of intermediary actors (for example, brokers and insurers) may also affect PV circularity. We limited the number of PV owner agents to one thousand, whereas more than one million real-world PV systems are in the United States 36 . Moreover, PV owners are not geographically characterized, albeit related through a social network. Although we use distributions to represent some geographical disparity, we distribute total installed PV capacity evenly between agents. Combining this ABM with a distributed PV model with a better spatial resolution, such as the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s Distributed Generation Market Demand model, could yield useful insights (for example, regarding geopolitical and demographic regional differences) 37 . Our study yields several implications for PV circularity. First, our results suggest that CE strategies compete, in line with the literature 38 . Thus, CE programmes should be based on the adoption rates for all circular pathways rather than focus on one CE strategy. Second, for reuse to be effective, the used product supply must match demand, and therefore secondary markets must be mature 39 . For example, only when PV owner attitudes towards used modules improve (for example, through wa",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ranties) does demand grow and start to substantially absorb used module supplies. Improving reuse is critical from an energy perspective, because recycling destroys most of the embedded energy of products 40 , 41 . However, owing to the growing PV demand as well as the lower efficiency and lifetime of used modules, even a 100% reuse rate could not satisfy PV demand, so recycling must be developed in concert with reuse initiatives. Our results also highlight the critical roles of the total recovery fraction of materials and the learning effect to achieve profitable recycling (Fig. 1b,f , respectively), in line with existing literature 30 . Interestingly, the storage pathway acts as a buffer, which provides time for recycling processes to become more economical and ultimately diverts some modules from landfills (Fig. 3a , purple wedge). This result suggests that encouraging recycling may be particularly critical where storage space is more limited (for example, Japan). Exploiting the ABM approach, we extended the traditional techno-economic analysis to include social factors, such as conformity to peers and general attitude towards a specific behaviour. Accounting for attitude is especially relevant for PV, because households and businesses may be inclined to environmental protection and thus recycling 42 , 43 . Our ABM can also be used to study interconnections and dynamics among different factors, as suggested by Lapko et al. 38 . Our results confirm the importance of factors such as the learning effect, research and development to reduce recycling costs, and public engagement 38 . Interestingly, the importance of the factors changes with the focus on different output metrics. The attitude towards used PV modules, for instance, seems less important considering the overall material circularity rate because the number of reused modules is low compared with the number of overall modules. However, this factor is the most influential regarding the overall societal cost because reuse retains more value within the economy than material recovery through recycling. Thus, ignoring social factors (such as attitude) may misrepresent the efficacy of CE interventions. Although there are currently no manufacturers of silicon wafers in the United States 44 , recycling modules in a facility near the manufacturing line is a competitive advantage, because it makes manufacturing more resilient to supply restrictions and potentially facilitates the recycling of manufacturing waste, such as silicon kerf. Recycling manufacturing waste is critical to improve the circularity, because scrap materials are less contaminated and have compositions that are better known, compared with those of postconsumer materials 45 . Such a strategy is already used by First Solar, a cadmium–telluride PV module manufacturer (Supplementary Fig. 6 ). The results also show that a landfill ban, such as the one in Washington State 31 , could increase PV circularity substantially (Fig. 1a ). However, legislation alone may be insufficient. Current European legislation, for instance, encourages mass recycling, but not necessarily high-quality multimaterials recycling 26 . Finally, our results show that high subsidies for a few years could be among the most efficient solutions to encourage recycling. In contrast with Deng et al., who found that landfill costs have the most potent effect, followed by recycling costs, we found that the initial recycling costs have the most substantial effect, followed by landfill costs 30 . This difference may occur for different reasons, for instance, because of different data used in the analysis or because the proposed model includes social factors, which impact recycling and purchasing behaviours and, thus, the results. Moreover, when looking at output metrics other than the material circularity rate, the ranking of the most influential factors changes (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Figs. 12 and 13 ). In summary, this work highlights the importance of considering social factors in future CE studies. When such factors are ignored, the results may be overestimated or underestimated as they may not represent what happens in the real world. Moreover, the key to improve PV material circularity and retain maximum value in the economy may be in social interventions that aim to improve customer attitudes towards used PV modules (for example, with better certifications and warranties). Could it be possible to have a secondary market for used PV as strong as the market for used cars 34 ? In future work, the ABM could be used to study other scenarios, such as the effect of public information campaigns on recycling rates. Moreover, although a design-related intervention is briefly presented (Fig. 1e ), more scenarios related to the design stage, such as modules with different backsheet materials 46 , could be explored. This approach, combining ABM and ML, could also be developed further to study the circularity of other technologies, such as consumer electronics, or to include environmental considerations. Methods Overview Our ABM represents the main actors of the US PV sector that are involved in the transition to a more circular PV industry. Its objective is to find the techno-economic and social conditions that improve materials circularity for EOL PV modules. The ABM’s primary outputs are the mass volumes of modules that reach each EOL pathway (that is, amounts that are reused, repaired, recycled, landfilled or stored), the net revenue and cost for each CE actor, the value from recovered materials and the number of years it takes to reach a specific objective. The overview, design concepts and details protocol is used to describe the ABM in this section 47 , followed by details on the ML approach used to build a metamodel of the ABM and the sensitivity analysis method. The purpose of the ABM is to study the implementation of CE strategies within the PV industry and identify the conditions that improve circularity. Four types of agents are defined: PV owners, installers, recyclers and manufacturers. Agents of a specific type behave similarly, but have heterogeneous characteristics represented by probability distributions (for example, recyclers may have different recycling costs). Agents are related to each other according to a social network that represents the real-world relationships among the CE actors. In the simulation, a time step represents a year. The start of the simulation is 2020, with 30 time steps chosen because many installations will reach their EOL around 2050 5 . The ABM builds on several existing models (referred as submodels in Supplementary Table 1 ). At each time step, the submodels are used in coordination to generate the output metrics. The ABM starts by modelling the cumulative amount of PV modules in use (that is, the stocks), following an approach from the literature 5 . Then, the amount of EOL PV modules is computed from a model and data from the same source 5 . We apply another submodel to represent how agents make decisions regarding a particular CE strategy. The modelled CE strategies include repair, reuse (of a repaired and/or refurbished product) and recycle, and the two other options landfill and storage. Agent decisions are based on techno-economic factors—which include technical feasibility, such as whether the modules can be repaired, and costs, such as landfill costs—and market factors (such as attitudes and social norms). The parameters used in this submodel were taken from meta-analyses on recycling and purchasing behaviours, in which it was reported that consumers influence each other’s behaviours in addition to being influenced by behaviours’ costs 48 , 49 . To compute the material circularity and the societal costs (that is, net costs of manufacturers, recyclers and installers), the ABM uses a submodel of PV module efficiency growth 5 , the mass fraction of material in the modules 5 , the different recycling processes’ material recovery fractions 26 , 50 and prices of virgin and scrap materials. The recycler learning effect also uses a model and data from the literature 28 . Another submodel estimates the transportation costs related to the different EOL pathways (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 14 ). The resulting volumes of repaired, reused, recycled, landfilled and stored change with each time step of the simulation. Supplementary Fig. 1 presents an overview of the model, Supplementary Table 1 and the sections below provide more methodological details. Design concept The ABM is designed in a modular fashion to ensure it can be used for different case studies; different types of agents may be defined and easily added to the model. Each agent type is defined as a Python module. In these modules, agent types are defined as Python classes, and it follows that each agent is an instance of the class of its type. A Python model module contains all the user-defined inputs, activates the agents and collects the outputs of the simulation. This modular structure is per the Mesa Python package 51 . This package is used to facilitate the activation of the agents and set up batch runs of simulations. The NetworkX Python package is also used to build the social networks relating the agents 52 . Interactions between actors of the CE are captured at several levels in the ABM (that is, within agents of the same type and between agent types). First, because interactions between PV owners may influence their decisions regarding EOL management 22 ,48,53, they are accounted for in the model. Second, information flows between agents of different types. For instance, PV owners have access to recyclers’ recycling costs, and installers access the amount of PV modules being sold by PV owners. As another example, manufacturers know the amounts of materials being recovered by recyclers and compute the economic benefits of using those materials rather than virgin materials. The model also contains several stochastic elements. First, the Watts–Strogatz algorithm, which is widely used to build small-world networks, requires us to rewire each edge of a regular graph with a certain probability 52 ,54, 55 . Small-world networks are recognized as representing many real-world networks, which include social networks 54 ,55,56, 57 . Second, some of the agents’ characteristics are drawn from probability distributions to model their variability or uncertainty (for example, recycling or landfill costs may be different across the United States). Finally, the system’s overall behaviour emerges from the agents’ interactions and decisions during the simulation. Details At the beginning of the simulation, the network of agents is created. The stocks of PV modules from 2000 to 2020 are reported in the ABM and divided among PV owner agents. We chose stocks from 2000 to 2020 to account for the existing installed capacity, assuming that, before 2000, the cumulative installed capacity was negligible. From there, several submodels are used to represent various dynamics of the hypothetical circular PV sector. The environment of the ABM is the United States. Various interventions may be enacted in the environment to see their effects. For instance, scenarios that study the implementation of a tax or a ban may be modelled as part of the environment agents that evolve within. Moreover, agents’ interactions are dependent on a social network that represents the real-world relationships between the PV industry actors (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 15 ). In contrast with aggregated models, the ABM enables the modelling of different social network structures and provides insights into the social network role in the overall behaviour of the system 54 . Different network structures are adapted to different real-world situations. For instance, a fully connected network is more adapted to describing small groups and tight communities. For sociotechnical systems, such as the power grid or cities, the small-world or scale-free networks are more realistic 54 , 56 . In the ABM, a small-world network is drawn using a rewiring probability and the average number of neighbours of 0.1 and 10, respectively. These parameters are close to those of other works and real-world networks such as email communications 54 , 58 . Owing to computational limitations, the number of PV owners was restricted to 1,000 agents. Although it limits the representativeness of the ABM, this number of agents enables the capture of network effects and the existing variability of PV owners (for example, regarding landfill costs across the United States or attitudes towards CE pathways). The PV owners make two decisions: to purchase a new or a used product, and to manage the EOL of their products (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 16 ). Several processes also occur in the PV owners’ module. First, the amount of product purchased each year is determined according to a piecewise function, following previous work 5 , and thus similar results for the projected installed capacity are obtained, although we only consider US c-Si PV modules. Values for the model’s parameters can be found in Supplementary Information , Supplementary Tables 1 , 7 and 8 . Still following the literature, the efficiency growth of PV modules is accounted for with an exponential function 5 . Next, a Weibull function (from which the parameters are based on empirical data 5 ) is used to generate the amount of PV modules of agent i that reaches EOL at time t , \({\rm{ELPV}}_i^t\) (equation ( 1 )): $$\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {{\rm{ELPV}}_i^t = \mathop {\sum }\limits_t {\rm{RPA}}_i^t \times \left( {1 - {\rm{e}}^{ - (t/T)^\alpha }} \right)} \end{array}$$ (1) In the equation, T is the average lifetime of the PV modules, α the shape factor (which controls the typical S shape of the Weibull curve) and \({\rm{RPA}}_i^t\) is the remaining amount of PV modules installed by agent i at time step t . The Weibull function is appropriate to model the PV waste generation 5 . The TPB 59 is used to model the PV owners’ decisions to purchase used or new modules and the EOL management of these modules. The TPB stipulates that human behaviours are influenced by the attitude A individuals hold towards the behaviour (that is, how the behaviour is perceived as favourable or unfavourable), the subjective norm SN, which refers to the perceived social pressure to perform or not perform the behaviour and the perceived behavioural control (PBC), which relates to the perceived ease or difficulty of performing the behaviour (equation ( 2 )): $$\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {{\rm{BI}} = w_AA + w_{{\rm{SN}}}{\rm{SN}} + w_{{\rm{PBC}}}{\rm{PBC}}} \end{array}} \end{array}$$ (2) In the equation, BI is the intention to perform the behaviour, and w A , w SN and w PBC are the weights of each factor in the overall decision. The TPB is often used in ABMs of sociotechnical systems because it explains the process of individual decision making straightforwardly 21 ,24, 60 and has been applied in many waste-management ABMs 21 ,22, 24 . The theory explains consumers’ decisions 49 , 61 as well as decisions within companies 13 ,62,63, 64 . In our ABM, a score is attributed to each EOL pathway according to the TPB. The attitude level of each agent regarding the CE pathways (repairing, reusing and recycling) is normally distributed between 0 (negative attitude) and 1 (positive attitude). The attitude level towards linear pathways (landfilling and storing) is simply assumed to be one minus the attitude held for CE pathways. Although this distribution of agents is rather simple when compared with that in the literature 21 , it is deemed sufficient for this exploratory analysis. As the parameters of the truncated normal distribution were unknown, they were calibrated. Thus, an iterative process was undertaken to find the values that reproduce low recycling 3 , 8 and reuse 65 rates, as they represent today’s situation. The second element of the TPB, the subjective norm \(SN_{ip}^t\) of agent i and pathway p at t , is defined as per equation ( 3 ): $$\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {{\rm{SN}}_{ip}^t = \mathop {\sum }\limits_n \frac{{{\rm{Path}}_{np}^t}}{N}} \end{array}$$ (3) with \({\rm{Path}}_{np}^t\) being 1 if agent i ’s neighbour n has selected path p and zero otherwise, and N being the total number of neighbours of agent i . Thus, the subjective norm takes values between zero (no peer pressure) and one (maximum peer pressure). In the ABM, although neighbours designate nodes that share an edge in the small-world network, they may represent various relationships among PV owners in the real world (for example, friends, family, co-workers and actual neighbours). The third element of the TPB, the perceived behavioural control (that is, the perceived economic or cognitive ability to perform the behaviour), \({\rm{PBC}}_{ip}^t\) of agent i and pathway p at t is given by equation ( 4 ): $$\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {{\rm{PBC}}_{ip}^t = - {\rm{max}}\left( {0;\frac{{{\rm{Cost}}_{ip}^t}}{{|{\rm{max}}\left\{ {{\rm{Cost}}_{ip}^t\forall \,p} \right\}|}}} \right)} \end{array}$$ (4) where \({\rm{Cost}}_{ip}^t\) is the cost of choosing the pathway p at t for agent i . Finally, the behavioural intention \({\rm{BI}}_{ip}^t\) of agent i for pathway p at t is defined by equation ( 5 ): $$\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {{\rm{BI}}_{ip}^t = w_AA_{ip}^t + w_{{\rm{SN}}}{\rm{SN}}_{ip}^t + w_{{\rm{PBC}}}{\rm{PBC}}_{ip}^t} \end{array}} \end{array}$$ (5) In equation ( 5 ), the values for the attitude, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control factor coefficients ( w A , w SN and w PBC , respectively) are taken from an existing meta-analysis on factors that affect EOL management decisions 48 . Given the high uncertainty of the coefficients’ values (Supplementary Table 9 ), the agents could behave differently than described in this work. Supplementary Table 6 shows the results of a sensitivity analysis on the TPB’s coefficients. Alternatively, the coefficients’ values could be calibrated (however, the lack of empirical data on current and projected PV EOL management prevents us from conducting such extensive calibration). The agent then selects the EOL pathway with the highest score (and the amount of EOL modules \({\rm{ELPV}}_i^t\) is recorded as following the selected pathway for further use by other agents and the output metrics). The TPB is also used to model the purchase decision, similar to how the EOL decision is modelled. Two options are represented in this ABM, the purchase of a new or of a used module. Another meta-analysis is used to determine the TPB coefficient values for the purchase decision 49 . The TPB may be interpreted in terms of material efficiency potentials. If one defines w A and w SN to be 0, the techno-economic potentials of the recycling, repairing and reusing CE strategies may be studied on their own. Otherwise, the social factors of the model (the subjective norm and attitude) may be added, which enables study of the achievable (or market) potential of material efficiency 15 . Installers are the second type of agent (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 17 ). In the PV sector, installers may be in charge of collecting the EOL PV modules and eventually sorting them before selling them on the secondary market 66 (Supplementary Information , Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 18 ). They may also repair failed modules if PV owners opt for that EOL pathway. If there is insufficient demand for used modules or if they are too damaged or cost too much to be repaired (equations ( 6 ) and ( 7 )), installers send them to a recycler or landfill, or they store them (for a limited period defined in Supplementary Table 1 ) until another decision is made depending on the cheapest decision at the time of the simulation (using equation ( 4 )). Although installers’ repairing costs may decrease due to the learning effect, it is assumed that handling used PV modules bears the same repair costs (whether the modules are repaired directly for PV owners or sold as used products), regardless of the possible damage to the EOL modules: $$\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {V_j^t = \frac{{{\rm{RR}} \times (\mathop {\sum }\nolimits_i V_i^t + \mathop {\sum }\nolimits_k V_k^t)}}{{\mathop {\sum }\nolimits^ j}}\,{\rm{for}}\,i\,{\rm{and}}\,k\,{\rm{such}}\,{\rm{that}}\,{\rm{RC}}_i^t \le {\rm{RP}}_j^t\,{\rm{and}}\,{\rm{RC}}_k^t \le {\rm{RP}}_j^t} \end{array}$$ (6) $$\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {{\rm{RA}}_j^t = \left\{ {\begin{array}{*{20}{l}} {V_j^t\,{\rm{if}}\,\mathop {\sum }\limits_j V_j^t \le \mathop {\sum }\limits_i {\rm{DU}}_i^t\,{\rm{for}}\,i\,{\rm{such}}\,{\rm{that}}\,{\rm{PU}}_i^t = 1} \hfill \\ {0\,{\rm{otherwise}}} \hfill \end{array}} \right.} \end{array}$$ (7) In the equations, \(V_j^t\) is the volume of modules available for sale on the secondary market by installer j . Next, RR is the module repair rate, \(V_i^t\) and \(V_k^t\) are the volume of modules that flow from the PV owner i and recycler k at time t , respectively, \({\rm{RC}}_i^t\) and \({\rm{RC}}_k^t\) are the repair costs of modules from PV owner i and recycler k at time t , respectively, and \({\rm{RP}}_j^t\) is the price at which agent j is selling the used modules on the secondary market at time t . Finally, \({\rm{RA}}_j^t\) is the amount of used modules handled by installer j that is sold on the secondary market at time t ; it depends on the demand for used modules from PV owners ( \(\mathop {\sum }\limits_i {\rm{DU}}_i^t\) ). In equation ( 7 ), \({\rm{PU}}_i^t\) is a Boolean that is one when the PV owner i has decided to purchase a used module at time t and zero otherwise. Installers also improve their repair processes owing to the learning effect, and thus decrease repair costs. The learning effect can be characterized by several mechanisms, such as technology advancement, increased labour productivity, economies of scale and improved material and energy efficiency 28 . As the volume of EOL PV modules dealt with by an installer increases, at least three of these mechanisms may apply: increased labour productivity, economies of scale and energy efficiency. In the ABM, the learning effect is modelled as a function of the repaired volume, following the literature 28 . Recycler agents are similar to installers in two ways. First, they may take on the responsibility of sorting EOL PV modules that can be sold on secondary markets (with those modules then flowing to installers); this behaviour was assessed via interviews with a US recycler (RecyclePV, personal communication). Second, recyclers improve their recycling processes in the model, which simulates the learning effect (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 19 ). Another recycler role is to recover materials from EOL PV modules. In the ABM, this is simply modelled from the material recovery rates of a given recycling process (for example, simple mechanical processes or the FRELP process 26 ), the fractions of materials that constitute PV modules and the volume of modules being recycled. In the ABM, PV owners pay a fee to recycle EOL PV modules, whereas manufacturers buy recycled materials at market prices. With the current US recycling processes, revenue from the recovered materials is insufficient to cover recycling costs 26 . Manufacturer agents purchase recovered materials from recyclers (Supplementary Table 1 and Fig. 20 ). The avoided costs from using recovered rather than virgin materials can be computed within the model based on their respective values. For instance, the price of aluminium scrap is often about 60% of the price of virgin aluminium 67 , which brings profits for manufacturers that use aluminium. The model does not consider price fluctuation, given the price volatility of materials such as silicon and silver. We applied four validation techniques to ensure the quality of the results produced by the model: theory validation, data validation, model output validation and face validation 68 . First, regarding theory validation, only empirically validated models were used (for example, TPB). Next, for the baseline scenario, empirical data were mostly used; when parameters were unknown, they were calibrated 3 ,5,8, 65 . Given that several parameter combinations could lead to the same results (that is, equifinality), we further analysed the impact of different values for the two calibrated parameters (that is, the attitude values for the purchase of second-hand PV modules and EOL management) on the results (Supplementary Fig. 21 ). Then, the cumulative installed capacity and the mass of EOL PV modules generated during the 2020 to 2050 period were validated with the literature 5 (Supplementary Fig. 5 ). Finally, the results of the ABM went through an internal revision process with ABM and PV experts to ensure the model was behaving in a meaningful way, and extreme scenarios were also studied (Supplementary Table 10 ). Multilayer perceptron regressor metamodel and sensitivity analysis The combination of ABM and ML has recently gained attention owing to the complementarity of the two approaches 69 . These methods can be combined in two ways: ML can generate agent behavioural rules from data 35 , and an ABM can be explored in depth (that is, varying the ABM inputs to examine a wide range of possible outputs) by building a ML metamodel that avoids computationally intensive simulations and saves time 70 . The exploratory nature of this work meant we used the second approach in this study. Following Vahdati et al., we built a ML metamodel of the ABM described above 70 . Using the Scikit-learn Python library 71 , we constructed different ML models using different combinations of hyperparameters. In our study, all the features (input data) and output data are known in the dataset generated by the ABM; thus, a supervised ML is used. In this study, the training dataset is generated with the ABM. To produce the dataset that best represents the behaviour space of our model while limiting the required number of simulations, we used a quasi-Monte Carlo approach. First, we defined the range of each parameter to vary in the quasi-Monte Carlo simulations. For some parameters, it is merely their minimum and maximum possible values (for example, for ratios). For parameters without theoretical bounds, realistic ranges were defined according to the literature. For landfill costs, for instance, the minimum value was set to zero and the maximum value was set to twice the average value of the baseline scenario; it seems unrealistic that landfill costs could be higher than that based on current trends 27 . A similar logic was applied to other parameters (Supplementary Table 5 ). Next, the method from Saltelli was used to generate the Sobol sequences of parameter value combinations 72 . Sobol sequences aim to approximate the model’s behaviour within the parameter space by attempting to cover as much of the parameter space as possible as quickly (with the fewest samples) as possible. This is one of the highest-performing methods (for example, compared with the Latin hypercube design) regarding the quality of results obtained as a function of computational time, and it is often used to build metamodels 73 , 74 . Thus, using the SALib Python library 75 ,2,800 parameter value combinations were generated, to which we added the baseline parameter value combination as well as variants of the baseline, varying each parameter to its lower and upper bound (to include extreme cases in our dataset). In total,2,810 parameter value combinations were run 6 times (this number of replicates was found sufficient to account for the model’s stochasticity, based on a stability analysis reported in Supplementary Fig. 22 ), which amounted to 16,860 simulations. Next, we iterated a tenfold cross-validation, varying the ML algorithm, its hyperparameters and the output metric considered in the dataset. We kept the multilayer perceptron regressor algorithm, which yields a good compromise between computation time and a high coefficient of determination in all the output metrics (Supplementary Table 11 ). Once trained, the metamodel was used to predict the outputs of parameter value combinations not run with the ABM. The SALib library was finally used to conduct a variance-based (Sobol) sensitivity analysis and thus measure the variability of model outputs that can be accounted for by changes in the model inputs. We used the Sobol method because of its ability to evaluate interaction effects and the low risk that dependencies exist between the parameters of our ABM. Moreover, we compared the results from the variance-based sensitivity analysis with results from a moment-independent sensitivity analysis to confirm the rankings of the parameters (Supplementary Table 3 ). The use of the ML metamodel means results from Figs. 3b , 5 and 6 , Supplementary Tables 3 – 5 and Supplementary Figs. 9 – 13 are approximations of the ABM’s results.

More content below DSP CRTO TTD MACQ MACQU OB By Jarrett Banks Advertising-technology company AdTheorent Inc. plans to merge with SPAC MCAP Acquisition Corp. (Nasdaq: MACQ). The company uses machine learning and data science to optimize advertising and marketing campaigns for its customers. IPO Edge sat down with CEO James Lawson to find out more about going public and the future of adtech. IPO Edge: We’ve seen a number of adtech companies enter public markets in recent months. How are you different from others in the space? Within the programmatic ecosystem, AdTheorent is a Demand Side Platform, or DSP – but we’ve reimagined what that means. We are fundamentally different because we have pioneered a new method to target digital ads in a programmatic marketplace without relying on the primary methods of the past: cookies and licensed audience segments. Our new method – Predictive Advertising – drives industry-leading campaign performance without relying on user-specific profiles and individualized data. In place of legacy targeting methods, AdTheorent’s Predictive Advertising platform leverages award-winning data science and machine learning (ML) capabilities to deliver advertiser-specific business outcomes for our advertisers. Our brand and agency customers today not only want, but require, measurable business outcomes from their ad spend. That’s AdTheorent’s specialty. If a brand’s KPI is an online insurance quote application, for example, our platform and ML models will identify data attributes present most often when there is a conversion event. Then, our bidders automatically optimize toward those attributes to drive KPI performance, and our models learn and refine optimizations over time as more conversions occur. These attributes may include things like device type, operating system, one or more keywords in the URL, keywords in the page content, geographic data, time, or approximately 200 other data attributes that are available to inform our machine learning models. Using historical conversion data, we can determine the likelihood that each specific bid request will drive the online or real-world actions our clients desire. We model towards and deliver advanced conversions, not just clicks, and our ability to do so continually improves as our machine learning platform makes automated optimizations which make our ad targeting even more efficient. And this ability really sets us apart from our peer group. Story continues On top of this revolutionary platform and approach, AdTheorent’s proprietary suite of tools, methodologies and vertical solutions maximize performance and ROI for advertisers while operating in a privacy-first manner, which has become an essential element for brand marketers. AdTheorent’s platform is more effective and privacy-forward than other AdTech companies. This combination of consistent performance and more reliable business outcomes is what keeps our customers coming back and entrusting us with more of their business over time. IPO Edge: Why are you going public now, and how will it benefit the business? There has never been more demand for our capabilities and unique offerings, and now is a good time for us to accelerate the scale of our operation. We spent the past few years investing heavily in AdTheorent’s technology, accelerating organic growth and increasing efficiency. From a financial perspective, we are operating in excess of the ‘Rule of 50,’ with Revenue Less TAC growth and adjusted EBITDA margin each expected to be around 30% annually between 2020 and 2023. The market continues to move toward AdTheorent, which is validating for our business model and makes us excited about the opportunities ahead. Collectively with our investors, we believe AdTheorent’s unique positioning can drive outsized growth in the $90 billion market for US programmatic digital media spend, projected to grow 17.6% per annum through 2024. The public company structure and proceeds provided by the transaction will allow AdTheorent to optimize growth by increasing investment behind multiple growth vectors, both organic and inorganic. IPO Edge: You are going public through a SPAC merger with MCAP but your record of financial performance seems to set you apart from most SPACs, can you tell us about your thought process there? It is true, we are not a typical SPAC target given our historical strong financial performance. We expect great things from ourselves in the future, of course, but we come to the table with a track record of past financial performance that should be exciting and assuring for MCAP shareholders, and we think this makes us very unique among SPAC targets. We had lot of strategic options for this next chapter but ultimately decided to continue our solid partnership with Monroe given our history with them (as our lender) and their track record of success with other SPACs. We believe we will perform very well as a public company given our disciplined approach to running a profitable and growing business. IPO Edge: AdTheorent recently announced Q2 2021 business results, which showed continued growth in revenue. Can you give us insight into these results and the business drivers for them? We are very pleased with our Q2 2021 financial performance, which outpaced our expectations, growing revenue by 89% to $39.9 million compared to $21.1 million in the second quarter of 2020. This growth demonstrates the power of AdTheorent’s technology and solutions and our ability to deliver strong ROI for our advertiser clients. Brand marketers understand the value we provide to them and we have never been more confident about our ability to drive long-term durable growth. As a result, we raised our outlook for full-year 2021 and now expect revenue of at least $161.6 million, compared to our prior outlook for 2021 revenue of $157.7 million and expect full-year 2021 Revenue Less TAC* of at least $106.2 million, compared to our prior outlook for 2021 Revenue Less TAC of $102.4 million.Revenue Less TAC is a non-GAAP measure that adjusts for costs incurred to execute customer campaigns: advertising inventory, third party inventory validation and measurement, and data – which is collectively referred to as “traffic acquisition costs” or “TAC”. IPO Edge: Based on your experience thus far throughout 2021 and the nature of the digital market, what are the best opportunities to expand your business for the rest of this year, and into 2022? According to the Winterberry Group, digital media spending will exceed $171 billion in the US in 2021 and is poised for exceptional growth, driven in large part by programmatic advertising. As I mentioned earlier, programmatic digital spending in the US is a $90 billion Total Addressable Market in 2021, forecasted to grow at a 17.6% CAGR to $141 billion by 2024. Since 2012, AdTheorent has pioneered a new way to target digital ads programmatically without relying on user-specific personal profiles and individualized data. We have a history of operating efficiently, with consistent margin expansion the last four years, tracking toward 30% revenue growth and 30% adjusted EBITDA margins in 2021. We see a number of meaningful organic opportunities, including increased revenue in Connected TV, or CTV, continued vertical growth and expansion, and we will look into international expansion given our privacy-forward approach to ad-targeting. We will also look to opportunistically invest in M&A to accelerate these opportunities. CTV, in particular, is a major growth opportunity for AdTheorent. Streaming services like Hulu are the fastest growing sector as traditional TV dollars shift to digital. AdTheorent applies machine learning to CTV to drive performance-based outcomes based on our advanced, proprietary analytics capabilities. With limited investment, our 2021 CTV revenues are anticipated to be $40 million, representing approximately 300% growth year-over-year, and with additional investment, we believe we can continue to materially outpace expected annual industry growth of 18%. With respect to vertical growth, we believe it is important to continue to invest in solutions which solve our customers’ unique campaign challenges. That means coming up with new and better ways to attain their campaign KPIs, sensitive to data limitations and rules in various regulated industries. We have a list of innovations and new offerings that we are excited to explore across a number of different verticals, and this investment capital will help us accelerate our plans. IPO Edge: At the moment, cookies are the biggest trend in the digital advertising industry. Google has declared its intention to doing away with cookies, and Apple is restricting the use of device IDs for advertising. How do you believe this will impact the industry, and what will happen to the existing digital ad market, which is almost entirely compromised of cookie-based and ID-based ads? And how does AdTheorent benefit? Google recently announced that by 2023 third-party cookies will not be used within its Chrome browser, following Apple’s work to phase out the use of third-party cookies from the Safari browser. Google has delayed this transition for a number of reasons, including the chaos that would likely ensue if the cord were pulled too quickly. Without the proper groundwork in place, publishers could be forced to enact paywalls on their content across the internet, which would alienate consumers. While the industry scrambles to figure out a replacement for third-party cookies and competitors in the adtech space are distracted by the coming transition, we will continue to improve our algorithms and Predictive Targeting methods using machine learning. We will continue to win with customers because we deliver superior ROIs and measurable results on the business actions that matter most to them. Unlike our competitors, AdTheorent is already prepared for a cookie-less future, whether it comes tomorrow or years in the future. As stated previously, AdTheorent’s advantage is that our ad-targeting approach does not require us to know anything personally identifiable or sensitive about the user, including the user’s name, interests or website activity. We simply look at a moment in time – when a person accesses a piece of digital content – and we optimize media buying decisions based on the statistical likelihood of a given ad impression converting on a given customer KPI. The bid requests ingested by our platform include a number of different values and data points, including device type, operating system, one or more keywords in the URL, keywords in the page content, geographic data, time, or approximately 200 other data attributes that are available to inform our machine learning models. From there, there are microseconds in which AdTheorent and other DSPs are deciding whether to bid on that digital real estate. Our platform essentially says: “The bid request has these data elements present. What do our models tell us? Is this going to be valuable for a brand trying to sell sneakers online?” Our models are there to tell us that and make the best decision in an instant. Our platform evaluates more than one million impressions per second and we bid on less than 0.1% of those impressions. This is the magic of AdTheorent and why we are able to consistently drive high ROIs for our customers. This keeps our customers coming back and spending more with us over time. IPO Edge: What do you see as the next big thing in the digital advertising industry? Since 2012 the AdTheorent team has been working on the shared vision of ML-powered programmatic advertising. We’re not the product of acquisitions, tuck-ins or bolt-ons. We created AdTheorent from the ground up, we have a gifted CTO who is an ad tech pioneer and who has been here with his core team from day 1, and we will continue to rapidly innovate in the space and deliver the best results for our customers. This is the key going forward, as the the digital advertising industry will continue to grow and adapt, based on consumer behaviors and preferences. I believe there will be an evolution of AdTech towards machine learning-powered advertising, and AdTheorent is at the forefront of this shift. At its core, data science and machine learning are easier to practice in rhetorical form, as many companies do on websites and in marketing collateral. In practice, it is quite difficult to operationalize efficiently. Using data science and ML to target ads in microseconds is hard, especially when you consider the advanced KPIs our customers expect us to drive for them. It has taken AdTheorent a significant amount of time to build and refine our platform and solutions, and we have a great team of data scientists and engineers and product professionals who have helped us get here. We feel this has made for a deep, wide moat when compared to others in the space.

Workforce Automation Artificial Intelligence Concerns that emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and automation could wipe out wide swaths of American jobs aren’t backed up by data, according to a Sept. 13 report released by the nonprofit, nonpartisan Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. The report examines decades’ worth of data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics across 10 industries—construction, leisure and hospitality, professional and business services, retail trade, transportation and warehousing, wholesale trade, financial activities, information, education and health services, and manufacturing. The report found rates of job loss in each industry were lower in the third quarter of 2020 than in 1995. The third quarter of 2020 represented a stabilization of the American job market following a significant spike in job losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic that reached as high as 45% in the leisure and hospital industries. According to the report, U.S. workers have about a 5.8% chance of losing their jobs across those industries in any given quarter, down from 7.3% in 1995. “The prevailing narrative of accelerating job loss due to new technology is just a myth,” ITIF President Robert Atkinson, who co-authored the report, said in a statement. “The number of workers laid off each year as a share of all jobs has actually decreased steadily since the mid-1990s. Moreover, despite major employment disruption in the early stages of COVID-19, the rate of job loss has returned to the pre-pandemic trend line.” The report is a rebuttal to what ITIF calls the public’s “growing perception” that job insecurity is a staple of the modern tech-driven economy , as technology and automation become integral to everyday business. It warns that if public perception “misaligns with economic reality, there will likely be knock-on effects that could undermine growth—since pressure for stability build opposition to innovation and globalization.” “As unease grows, individuals may push lawmakers to enact stronger labor protections. But such laws could act as a drag on productivity if they limit the ability of firms to restructure work, as we see currently in Europe,” the report states. “Even more detrimental to innovation, workers and lawmakers may resist productivity-enhancing disruptions such as new information technologies or labor-saving robotics, even when such disruptions improve the economy. And they may pay attention to pundits calling for a tax on automation.” Share This: NEXT STORY: DOD Funds HBCUs to Advance Biotechnology and Materials Science Research Biden Administration Releases Draft Zero-Trust Guidance Postal Service Will Focus on Big Data, Digital Platforms Over Next 10 Years Air Force Wants to Spot Potential Outbreaks in Personnel Sooner with Wearables Swarms May Offer Next Level Artificial Intelligence Report: Hackers Shift from Malware to Credential Hijacking sponsor content Automatic Government Biden Administration Releases Draft Zero-Trust Guidance Postal Service Will Focus on Big Data, Digital Platforms Over Next 10 Years Air Force Wants to Spot Potential Outbreaks in Personnel Sooner with Wearables Swarms May Offer Next Level Artificial Intelligence Report: Hackers Shift from Malware to Credential Hijacking sponsor content Automatic Government X This website uses cookies to enhance user experience and to analyze performance and       traffic on our website.

A new dashboard launched today by the Johns Hopkins Center for Communication Programs (CCP) unpacks the survey findings and helps explain why—and how experts can work to increase acceptance rates. The center is based at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. The researchers found that the primary reasons around the world for resisting vaccination include fears about side effects, a desire to wait until more people have had the shots so they know they are safe, and a lack of confidence in whether the vaccine really works. These latest survey results, based on responses fielded between August 16 and 31, can be found in the new COVID Behaviors Dashboard. The new dashboard contains survey results based on responses from more than 12 million people from 115 countries, fielded every day since May 20, 2021. The survey—believed to be the world’s largest daily survey of global COVID knowledge, attitudes, and practices—is expected to continue until the end of this year and new data will become available every two weeks. The dashboard is intended to be used by policymakers, government officials, and public health practitioners at national and sub-national levels to better understand the behavioral drivers behind vaccine uptake, masking, and physical distancing that can prevent the spread of COVID-19. “Our analysis of this large trove of data finds that while vaccine hesitancy is real, there are many people around the globe who can be encouraged to get their doses—if public health officials can build and share their messages to address their concerns,” says Dominick Shattuck, PhD, CCP’s director of monitoring evaluation and learning and one of the leaders of the COVID behaviors project. Adds Marla Shaivitz, CCP’s director of digital strategy: “The dashboard can be used as a roadmap for policymakers to identify and engage with citizens to encourage them to be vaccinated to protect themselves and their families from COVID-19. In many countries, this dashboard fills an important data gap. It offers the most comprehensive data some governments have access to on how COVID behaviors are changing and what they can do to intervene.” The dashboard is the product of a collaboration among CCP, the World Health Organization’s Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, and Facebook. The data are generated from the COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey, which is administered in the United States by the Delphi Group at Carnegie Mellon University and in other countries by the University of Maryland Social Data Science Center. The two universities collect the survey data from random samples of Facebook users and CCP analyzes the responses. A previous COVID behaviors dashboard , also led by CCP, was based on smaller, less frequent surveys from June 2020 through March 2021. In this latest survey, reasons for vaccine hesitancy vary by country. In Senegal, the two most common reasons for hesitancy are concerns about side effects and whether the vaccine is safe. Education around vaccine science and side effects could work to encourage vaccine uptake in Senegal. Respondents in the Netherlands were more likely than those in other countries to say that they don't believe they need a vaccine. When asked why not, their main reasons were because they are not a member of a high-risk group, or they don’t believe COVID-19 is a serious illness. Each underlying perception requires a different messaging response. The dashboard sheds light on how other behaviors have evolved over the last four months as well. In the United States, for example, 65 percent of those who responded to the survey between August 16 and 31 said they had been shopping indoors in the previous 24 hours, and two thirds of those who had been shopping said they wore masks. Mask wearing steadily decreased in the U.S. until the middle of July but has been rising since the highly transmissible Delta variant became the dominant strain, and case counts and hospitalizations began rising again to record levels in many states. In India, where an outbreak has fallen from its May peak, only 29 percent of respondents had been shopping indoors in the previous 24 hours and the vast majority of them (87 percent) were wearing masks, suggesting there is a long way to go before things get back to normal. Since March 2020, nearly 225 million COVID cases—and 4.6 million deaths—have been reported around the world, according to Johns Hopkins University ’s COVID-19 dashboard . More than 5.3 billion vaccine doses have been administered globally, though just over two percent of those doses have been administered in Africa. USAID has sent more than 110 million doses to low- and middle-income countries and COVAX, a worldwide initiative aimed at equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines, has distributed more than 236 million doses. As vaccine access increases, governments will need to develop strategies to sensitize citizens to accurate information and the benefits of vaccines. In addition to findings about vaccine hesitancy, the dashboard also features data on why many people who want vaccines can’t seem to access them. In Brazil, for example, where 65 percent of the unvaccinated respondents in the August 16–31 survey period said they probably or definitely want a vaccine, 23 percent of those who want one said they couldn’t get a shot because they are not eligible for one, and 34 percent said there were no appointments available. Armed with knowledge from the dashboard, officials in those countries can aim to work with local communities to make vaccine appointments more accessible—once vaccines are widely available—and to better spread the word about appointments that are available and when, where, and how to secure them. “We are at a critical time for global COVID-19 vaccine rollouts, yet populations are oversaturated with information, disinformation, and rumors,” says Jeni Stolow, PhD, MPH, Risk Communication and Community Engagement Focal Point at WHO’s Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network. “Continuously producing timely evidence-based and effective health communication is a major challenge in this second year of the pandemic. This dashboard can support public health practitioners around the globe in their endeavors to tailor, target, and reinvigorate their local COVID-19 vaccine outreach efforts.” While many unvaccinated people around the world say they are unlikely to get vaccinated, in many countries, large percentages of the population say they would choose to get their children vaccinated once a vaccine becomes available. In India and Guatemala, well over 90 percent of survey respondents said they would definitely or probably vaccinate their children. Data from August 16 through 31 show the figure was 86 percent in Mozambique, 72 percent in the United States, and 47 percent in Serbia. “The volume of data that has and will continue to be collected on COVID-19 will be of great value to policymakers and health practitioners, if the data are strategically used,” says Douglas Storey, PhD, CCP’s director for communication science and research. “This dashboard offers deep insights into behaviors around the world and will be a guide for those aiming to stop the spread of this devastating disease.” CCP is hosting a webinar about the new dashboard with experts from the center and WHO’s Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network on Tuesday, September 21, 2021, at 9:30 a.m., ET.

During the event, David Cieslak, Chief Data Scientist for Aunalytics, will discuss the use of natural language interface synthesis of SQL database queries leveraging the company’s new NL2SQL System. Natural language interface integration with database environments is a growing field that enables end users to interact with relational databases without technical database skills. These interfaces solve the problem of synthesizing SQL queries based on natural language input from the user. There are considerable research interests around the topic but there are few systems to date that are deployed on top of active enterprise data marts. At ECML-PKDD 2021, Aunalytics will introduce the NL2SQL system and present on data simulations that provide adaptive feedback for continuous model advancement. The architecture of the NL2SQL is built on WikiSQL data and research conducted by the data science team at Aunalytics. The company supports multiple scenarios using a unique table expansion process. The data simulation and the feedback loop help the model continuously adjust to linguistic variation introduced by the domain specific knowledge. “We are excited to explore this emerging area with the professionals attending ECML-PKDD 2021,” said David Cieslak, Chief Data Scientist, Aunalytics. “Advancements in natural language integration with today’s most widely deployed data marts is expected to improve business outcomes for financial institutions seeking next-level business intelligence.” The ECML-PKDD 2021 event is the premier European machine learning and data mining conference, building upon more than 19 years of successful events and conferences held across Europe.

Reuters Proxy advisers split on FedEx CEO Smith's pay Proxy advisers Institutional Shareholder Services Inc (ISS) and Glass Lewis & Co gave diverging recommendations to investors on voting on FedEx Corp CEO Fred Smith's $54 million pay package, after a labor union challenged the plan. The pay package for Smith, a billionaire, faces a challenge at FedEx's annual shareholder meeting later this month after labor union the International Brotherhood of Teamsters said the company's decision to cancel a bonus program while giving him an option award instead, only to then re-instate the bonus program, amounted to double-dipping.

These experts will be qualified to provide advice and information on science and technology research, development, ethics, standards, education, fairness, civil rights implications, technology transfer, commercial application, security, and economic competitiveness related to AI.” The September 8, 2021 press release entitled “ Department of Commerce Establishes National Artificial Intelligence Advisory Committee ” included these comments from Department Secretary Raimondo: AI presents an enormous opportunity to tackle the biggest issues of our time, strengthen our technological competitiveness, and be an engine for growth in nearly every sector of the economy, But we must be thoughtful, creative, and wise in how we address the challenges that accompany these new technologies. That includes, but is not limited to, ensuring that President Biden’s comprehensive commitment to advancing equity and racial justice extends to our development and use of AI technology. This committee will help the federal government to do that by providing insights into a full range of issues raised by AI.

Learn how. Register here The Transform Technology Summits start October 13th with Low-Code/No Code: Enabling Enterprise Agility. Register now! While 64% of employees in data science, AI, and machine learning took part in training or obtained new certifications over the past year, the average change in compensation was $9,252 — an increase of about 2.25% annually. That’s one of the findings in O’Reilly’s 2021 Data/AI Salary Survey , which took a look at job satisfaction and salaries in data science fields experiencing a shortage of qualified employees. The results suggest that data and AI professionals are among the most driven employees when it comes to upskilling — and have a clear desire to learn. “Given the shortage of qualified employees in fields like data science, machine learning, and AI, companies that are serious about building out their workforces must invest in learning and training to grow this talent internally,” O’Reilly president Laura Baldwin said in a statement. “With such a wealth of knowledgeable talent and a recovering global economy hungry to fill tech roles in digital work environments, there’s never been a better time to invest in employee learning and reskilling.” Laments over the AI talent shortage in the U.S. have become a familiar refrain from private industry. According to a report by Chinese tech company Tencent, there are about 300,000 AI professionals worldwide but “millions” of roles available. In 2018, Element AI estimated that of the 22,000 Ph.D.-educated researchers working on AI development and research globally, only 25% are “well-versed enough in the technology to work with teams to take it from research to application.” And a 2019 Gartner survey found that 54% of chief information officers view this skills gap as the biggest challenge facing their organization. Data science upskilling The O’Reilly survey polled 3,136 employees and compiled salary data based on gender, education level, job title, and tool and platform expertise. Ninety-one percent of respondents — who make an average of $146,000 per year — expressed an interest in learning new skills or improving existing skills, and those who dedicated the time to learn were rewarded with larger salary increases. While employees who participated in one to 19 hours of training only saw an average salary increase of $7,100, those who dedicated more than 100 hours saw an $11,000 average bump in annual pay, according to O’Reilly. Indeed, data scientists responding to the survey believe that attaining new technical skills will garner them more job responsibilities, an increase in hireability, and greater job security. This generally holds true, but salary bumps in data science — as with the broader tech industry — depend partly on gender, O’Reilly found. Women’s salaries are significantly lower than men’s, equating to 84% of the average salary for men regardless of education or job title. For example, at the executive level, the average salary for women was $163,000 versus $205,000 for men, O’Reilly found — a 20% difference. Previous studies have identified disparities in data science hiring along gender and ethnic lines. For example, minority-ethnic groups make up less than half of technical leads and directors despite holding 70% of entry-level data and analytics roles. A BCG survey found that the field’s “male-dominated competitive culture” topped the list of concerns about data science for many female college students; it’s estimated that as few as 15% of data scientists today are women. Twenty-two percent of respondents to the O’Reilly report say that they considered changing jobs due to a lack of salary increase over the past year. Meanwhile, 18% said that their salaries had remained the same over the last three years. Hiring boom In a June 2020 report , LinkedIn found that the pandemic dampened the demand for AI talent from employers as well as enthusiasm from job applicants. During the 10 weeks immediately following mid-March, growth rates slowed down, with listings for AI roles dropping to only 4.6% year-over-year compared with 14% prior to the outbreak. The market has recovered since — 81% of data science and analytics teams plan to hire in Q3 or Q4 of 2021, and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts the number of data science jobs will increase by 28% through 2026. But salaries are heavily depending on job applicants’ programming tools of choice. According to O’Reilly, professionals who use Rust have the highest average salary (over $180,000), followed by Go ($179,000), Scala ($178,000), and Python ($150,000). Expertise in PyTorch ($166,000), TensorFlow ($164,000), and scikit-learn ($157,000) paid among the best, while the highest salaries were associated with H2O ($183,000), KNIME ($180,000), Spark NLP ($179,000), and Spark MLlib ($175,000). “Our survey reveals just how dedicated data and AI professionals are to advancing their careers through skill development and training. Getting L&D right is crucial for companies to retain and attract top talent in this hot job market,” Mike Loukides, report author and VP of content at O’Reilly, said in a statement.

LOUIS — Area universities are deepening their investment in the region’s growing geospatial industry, a commitment officials with the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency praised on Tuesday as key for the U.S. to stay ahead in the burgeoning field. St. Louis University has created new academic programs to recruit and train the next generation of geospatial and data science experts, and Harris-Stowe State University is devising plans to give students of color and other underrepresented groups access to those opportunities, leaders of both universities said on Tuesday at a geospatial conference at SLU. “If we can actually prepare individuals who live in that community, students who are growing up in that community, for rewarding careers in geospatial intelligence, it can be a gamechanger for them,” Harris-Stowe interim President LaTonia Collins Smith said, “and change the trajectory for not only that individual but for their family and generations to come.” The goal is to not only build a workforce to support NGA’s new $1.7 billion campus in north St. Louis, but also to signal to the outside world that the region is the nerve center for this sector. Many civic and business leaders have pinned their hopes for the area’s future on the development of the geospatial industry and the potential to get the pendulum swinging in St. Louis’ favor after decades of corporate disinvestment and slow population growth. Work is already underway to bolster the industry in St. Louis: SLU, Harris-Stowe and the University of Missouri-St. Louis launched innovation centers to introduce their students to the industry and develop them for it. Downtown incubator T-REX dedicated a floor to geospatial technology. Regional business group Greater St. Louis Inc. devised a strategy to boost geospatial efforts and ensure minorities can take advantage of opportunities. And several companies have already either moved to St. Louis to be close to the new NGA facility, or expanded existing operations, including California-based mapping firm Esri, the U.S. offices of Swedish company T-Kartor, and software firm Boundless, which moved from New York in 2017. Businesses consider ditching downtown St. Louis amid gunfire, violence ‘Major problem’: St. Louis puts downtown's Reign Restaurant on trial St. Louis liquor chief suspends Reign’s license, calls restaurant ‘serious threat’ to public Employee bilked St. Louis County flooring company out of at least $300k, feds say Jones adds police, outlines plan to improve downtown's image “It’s one of the reasons why I’m so excited about everything we’re doing in St. Louis,” said Vice Adm. Robert Sharp, NGA director. “We need to make sure we’re the very best at taking advantage ... so that we remain the world’s premier geospatial intelligence organization.” Harris-Stowe’s Collins Smith and St. Louis University President Fred Pestello spoke of their institutions’ work during a panel discussion with Sharp on Tuesday at the annual Geo-Resolution conference cohosted by SLU and NGA. “It’s something we were not engaged in at a very deep level just a few years ago,” Pestello said. “Like the region, SLU is all in on this.” Pestello did not elaborate on the university’s new geospatial programs. At Harris-Stowe, discussions are underway on how to expose K-12 students to the geospatial industry. It has already begun partnering with the NGA and Denver-based geospatial company Maxar Technologies on “mapathons,” where Harris-Stowe students learned how to use mapping and data technology. Meanwhile, construction on the new NGA’s north city campus remains on track for a 2025 opening date. That’s when the agency plans to move all of its employees from its existing Second Street facility to its new campus at Jefferson and Cass avenues, said Susan Pollman, NGA program director for the new campus. Once that move is complete, the government will look to sell the Second Street property, which is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. NGA’s facility in Arnold will remain open, Pollman said. 0 comments Tags Level1 Harris-stowe State University University National Geospatial-intelligence Agency Industry Company Commerce Watch Now: Related Video The Bottom Line: Afghan refugees can provide an economic boost The Bottom Line: Sooner or later, we’ll have to deal with evictions topical The Bottom Line: Sooner or later, we’ll have to deal with evictions The Bottom Line: Employers can boost vaccination rates topical The Bottom Line: Employers can boost vaccination rates Watch now: Amazon is reportedly planning to open department stores Watch now: Amazon is reportedly planning to open department stores Daily updates on the latest news in the St. Louis business community.

Delivered every Saturday morning. The Luddites claimed a place in history when they smashed up textile looms displacing their labour. But there was a quieter constituency unrecognised for the profound impact they had on the industrial revolution: the masses of people who sat back and let technology transform the world. Now, on the brink of another revolution, wrought by artificial intelligence, AI guru and former head of Google in China, Kai-Fu Lee, warns that this time, societies need to be prepared for the destructive potential of machines that are capable of reasoning, learning and problem-solving like humans. AI 2041 presents a “road map of the coming decades” demonstrating how AI will develop through a combination of essays written by Lee and short stories penned by the rising star of Chinese science fiction, Chen Qiufan. Chen transforms Lee’s vision into 10 tales set across the world, from an Indian teenager’s fight against a discriminatory algorithm in her quest for love to an evil German scientist on the brink of unleashing quantum genocide. The book brims with intriguing insights into the ways industries could harness intelligent machines. Medical examinations will no longer require human contact, with smart toilets analysing patients’ excrement without any need for handling test tubes. Waiters will give dish recommendations based on records of a customer’s favourite meals and penchant for adventure. The thesis is simple: AI has the capacity for good and evil, but humans — not machines — are responsible for determining its end use. The book warns readers to guard against apathy that could easily take root if we presume to have lost the capacity to shape the world by giving intelligence to machines. “We are the masters of our fate, and no technological revolution will ever change that,” writes Lee. The authors hold up a mirror to the state of AI today for clues about what the future holds and presents a laundry list of measures governments and companies should take to defend against the technology’s negative externalities. But the book fails to reflect on the most glaring example of its harmful application. No mention is made of the role leading Chinese AI companies play in enacting China’s sprawling surveillance state — unsurprising given Lee’s financial stake in the issue. His venture capital firm Sinovation was an early investor in Megvii, whose facial recognition technology is used by Chinese security services to enforce strict population control measures. The New York Times reported in 2019 that Megvii’s AI had been trained to identify Uyghur Muslims, enabling police to track their movement in Xinjiang. The company denies that their tech is used to violate human rights. Chen’s short stories in AI 2041 also lack the dark and witty introspection that makes his earlier work so convincing. The writer gained notoriety with his 2011 short story, The Fish of Lijiang , a brilliantly crafted tale of a burnt-out office worker who goes to a holiday resort frequented in his youth to escape the drudgery of his digitalised existence. The protagonist falls deeper into despair upon discovering that everything in the resort is fake, including the holographic fish he presumed to be the only remaining sign of real life. But the stories in AI 2041 are made subservient to the book’s aim of educating the reader. Clunky explanations about AI are shoehorned into dialogue, with too few words spared for the fast-paced narrative. No mention is made of the role leading Chinese AI companies play in enacting China’s sprawling surveillance state For all the book’s flaws, it does succeed in demystifying AI and provides a useful cautionary guide. Some of the warnings about the dangerous externalities of AI are familiar. In 2041 Nigeria, deepfake videos of popular figures seemingly spouting vitriolic propaganda exacerbate tensions between the Igbo and Yorubas. Jordan Peele, director of Get Out, in 2018, released a video of a machine-generated Barack Obama calling Donald Trump “a total and complete dipshit” to demonstrate that the human eye could no longer discern fact from fiction. But where technology has created a problem, it also has a solution. Lee predicts regulation will mandate social media sites to host anti-deepfake software to alert users to fabricated content. “In the story of AI and humans, if we get the dance between artificial intelligence and human society right, it would unquestionably be the single greatest achievement in human history,” Lee proclaims. AI will also be a force for good. Lives will be saved with quicker medical diagnoses. Repetitive tasks from stacking shelves to crunching data will be done by machines, freeing workers for more creative tasks. AI 2041 is a manifesto for us to seek out the best in this technology. It falls to everyone — including the authors of this book — to put that lesson into practice.

In fact, AI is the number one workload for the edge, according to Moor Insights & Strategy in the newly published paper, “Delivering the AI-Enabled Edge with Dell Technologies.” The paper also points out that numerous organizations across all industries are extending the reach of their IT infrastructures to the edge, with many of them being directed from the top down. Edge Dynamics and Requirements As we move further into a world of autonomous operations, whether it be with self-driving vehicles or automated manufacturing lines, the combination of AI and the edge, along with a robust and scalable enterprise IT infrastructure, is required to bring full automation to fruition. However, the pairing of AI and edge adds new levels of complexity, with many edge devices and endpoints being located in less secure environments, where devices will need to be hardened against weather and theft. Deploying edge devices to remote locations should not be an afterthought. An edge solution ideally will be fully integrated with an organization’s overall IT infrastructure and thus be as enterprise-grade as the rest of the data center. Although the requirements of AI at the edge can be exceedingly complex, for the most part they mirror the capabilities of traditional IT infrastructure. Edge solutions will need to be adaptable to many diverse environments. Edge applications need to be ready to be disconnected from traditional networks. Edge solutions deployed at scale will require new intelligent management functions. Edge devices need to be able to function in all types of potentially challenging scenarios making them reliable in all locations. Edge solutions located outside the confines of traditional IT walls require intrinsic and comprehensive security. Of course, organizations can deploy IT infrastructure capable of encompassing edge locations, but the most successful ones realize the value of strong technology partnerships in working with complex, emerging technologies such as AI at the edge. The AI-enabled Edge The proliferation of artificial intelligence continues apace across the spectrum and now the edge appears to be the last frontier for the development of a more autonomous environment. At Dell Technologies, we work with customers around the world on their AI initiatives. We are a leader in AI, driving innovations with it in our products, building the infrastructure to run AI workloads and deploying AI across our operations to streamline processes.

They use personal information to offer up suggestions for our entertainment experiences; they filter our social media content; and they’re also used for purposes we’re not always aware of—like predicting the likelihood of repeat offenders in the criminal justice system. But have you ever wondered who creates the codes for these algorithms? Or how the biases of these creators might impact how they’re used? Stephanie Dinkins is a renowned transmedia artist known for seeking out the answers to these questions through her work, often creating plat­forms for dia­logue about arti­fi­cial intel­li­gence as it inter­sects race, gen­der, aging and our future histories. A new exhibition, “ Stephanie Dinkins: Love & Data “—the first comprehensive survey of her work—is now on view at the University of Michigan’s Stamps Gallery in downtown Ann Arbor until Oct. 23. Inro panel for a new exhibition titled “Stephanie Dinkins: Love & Data”—the first comprehensive survey of work by transmedia artist Stephanie Dinkins, which is on view at the University of Michigan’s Stamps Gallery in downtown Ann Arbor until Oct. 23, 2021. Image credit: Eric Bronson, Michigan Photography As part of the show, she’ll open this year’s virtual Stamps Speaker Series Sept. 16 and is set to present a new projection work, “ On Love & Data & Holding Space ,” Sept. 24-25 in Detroit as part of DLECTRICITY, a night­time out­door fes­ti­val of art, light and tech­nol­ogy that show­cases extra­or­di­nary art by emerg­ing and estab­lished artists and cre­ative design pro­fes­sion­als. Through her art pro­duc­tion, exhi­bi­tions, com­mu­nity-based work­shops and pub­lic speak­ing engagements, Dink­ins has become a cen­tral fig­ure nation­ally and inter­na­tion­ally for her work expos­ing bias and inequity within arti­fi­cial intel­li­gence. “My inten­tion is to encour­ag­e action towards mak­ing arti­fi­cial intel­li­gence sys­tems more inclu­sive, acces­si­ble and transparent,” said Dinkins, who will debut new and inter­ac­tive instal­la­tions and work­shops at U-M this semester that build on her con­cept of “Afro-now-ism.” In a her poetic man­i­festo-like text, “Afro-now-ism: The unencumbered black mind is the wellspring of possibility,” published online in the NOEMA journal in June 2020, Dink­ins asks her audi­ence, par­tic­u­larly those from com­mu­ni­ties of color, to not only con­front the litany of vio­lences that humans have wielded upon one another, based on the insti­tu­tional and social con­struc­tions of race, caste, class and gen­der to main­tain sta­tus quo and the cur­rent sys­tems of power—but rise above it by tak­ing action to start build­ing the world that they desire. ​”The question is not only what injustices you are fighting, but what do you in your heart of hearts want to create in this world?” she wrote. “For Black peo­ple in par­tic­u­lar, it means con­ceiv­ing your­self in the space of free and expan­sive thought and act­ing from a crit­i­cally inte­grated space, allow­ing for more com­mu­nity-sus­tain­ing work.” Each of the 10 works in the exhibition, including a glowing, neon sculpture titled after her “Afro-now-ism” concept, offer dialogues and ways of making artificial intelligence systems more inclusive, accessible, representational, and transparent. Visitors can also experience “Secret Garden,” which debuted at Sundance in January 2020. In it, Dinkins creates an immersive installation and web experience where viewers are invited to step inside a garden and encounter oral histories spanning generations of African American women. According to Stamps Gallery director and exhibition curator Srimoyee Mitra , Dinkins—through her instal­la­tions and work­shops—devel­ops a dia­logue with the audi­ence on the hier­ar­chies embed­ded within machine learn­ing and AI archi­tec­ture and one’s indi­vid­ual agency in trans­form­ing the algo­rithms within it. “We’re hoping audi­ences will explore and par­tic­i­pate in a dialogue on cre­at­ing a more inclu­sive, data-based nar­ra­tive of what gov­er­nance ‘of the peo­ple, by the peo­ple and for the peo­ple’ can look like in an AI-medi­ated world where care is encoded within our dig­i­tal civic system,” she said. The exhi­bi­tion is sup­ported by the Andy Warhol Foun­da­tion for the Visual Arts. The Stamps Gallery (201 S. Division St., Ann Arbor), operated by the Penny W. Stamps School of Art & Design , is free and open to the public Wednesday-Saturday 11 a.m.-5 p.m. and Thursday until 7 p.m. The most up-to-date COVID-19 safety policies can be found here .

For the past three years, under his leadership, the company has advanced its product offerings to include first-of-its-kind automated solutions, enabling its customers to collect and receive data in a matter of minutes. Among Bright Data’s thousands of customers are Fortune 500 companies, major e-commerce firms and sites, prominent finance firms, leading security operators, travel sites, academic and public sector organisations. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is fast shaping the world around us and is becoming increasingly important within business operations. In fact, research by Deloitte shows that 73% of IT and line-of-business executives see AI as an indispensable part of their current business. It’s clear to see there is great potential for AI in virtually all areas of our lives, but AI systems can only ever be as powerful as the information that they are built on. With huge quantities of very specific data needed to effectively train systems in the right way, we’ll explore the key points behind the data required and how it is being sourced. Web data – The AI goldmine First, we will look at where the data comes from, and it is more easily available than you might have assumed. That’s because it often comes from the largest source of information that has ever existed – publicly available web data. Public social media data, to give just one example, is being utilised by organisations as a source of information about consumer sentiment and behaviour. This data is being used to develop AI systems by businesses in industries as varied as insurance, market research, consumer finance, and real estate to gain an edge over their competition. In these instances, information such as Twitter posts and online reviews data is leveraged to develop the AI insights needed to stay afloat in a volatile business environment. For example, hiring announcements on Twitter or other job websites for positions in the automotive industry could indicate an economic rebound in that sector, or that the industry itself anticipates an uptick in demand. Overcoming data hurdles Although the data is widely available, accessing public web data at this mammoth scale is not without its challenges. Organisations are often blocked by competitors or for other reasons in the process of retrieving data, or they encounter difficulties accessing data in every region they are looking to target globally. Therefore it is important businesses adopt a web data platform that can consistently feed them the data they need. It will need to be a global network, with the capacity to handle gargantuan data volumes. Being able to access the correct data is essential as teaching AI systems properly is impossible without following the proper data retrieving protocols because only “clean” accurate data can create the right level of ROI for businesses. Often, requests seen as coming from data centres are blocked by websites, or fed incorrect information, as businesses want to prevent accessing data by their competition to gain a competitive advantage. Using a flexible web platform solves this problem as it provides you with a transparent view of the internet – just like it initially intended to do. The power of correct data Data is growing at an exponential rate and although businesses can benefit from this, they must take steps to ensure the right technology and processes are in place to generate real value. When looking at building an AI system, you could see it like building a house. You can have the best architect or the best team of builders on the planet, but if there are any flaws with the raw materials, they are the wrong type, or there are simply not enough of them, there are going to be serious issues with the final product. If you build on a foundation consisting of clean and accurate web data sources, you will have a robust base that you can build powerful AI systems on top of. These systems will be able to provide effective, dependable, and relevant business insights despite the unprecedented volatility in market trends.

Credit: Gabi Porter By Elaine Meyer Medicine is at a watershed moment: decades of technological advances have revealed unprecedented insights into human biology and how various physiological, genetic and lifestyle factors shape health. These findings have laid the groundwork for enduring change in medicine—an opportunity Weill Cornell Medicine is seizing with its June 17 launch of We’re Changing Medicine , a campaign to raise $1.5 billion for an expansive vision of medicine that will make a global impact. The historic investments will serve as the foundation for discovery of new approaches to prevent, detect, and cure disease, a vision of care that is equitable and individualized to each patient, and the training of diverse future healthcare leaders. It’s an ambitious pursuit, one befitting the brainpower and achievements of an institution credited with life-changing healthcare innovations. With more than $750 million raised already, the campaign creates a new synergy between Weill Cornell Medicine’s tri-partite mission to care, discover and teach, with a laser focus on three areas. The institution hopes to revolutionize the rapid acceleration of therapeutics from the bench to the bedside by harnessing the latest scientific approaches—such as translational cellular therapy, regenerative medicine, and artificial intelligence—and reimagining the foundational research landscape to benefit millions of patients around the world. It plans to build a world-class precision health enterprise that uses breakthrough data science to personalize prevention and care, with the long-term goal of changing the trajectory of preventive medicine. And it is poised to transform the medical school experience for a gifted student body through debt-free medical education and the construction of a new residence hall for students to thrive and realize their highest potential. Dr. Rainu Kaushal In addition to representing an investment in Weill Cornell Medicine, the campaign will encourage further collaborations with Cornell’s Ithaca campus, as well as Cornell Tech and Weill Cornell Medicine–Qatar, and partners and affiliates NewYork-Presbyterian, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, The Rockefeller University, Hospital for Special Surgery and Houston Methodist. “Science is a team sport, and when you can bring different disciplines together, it can transform patients’ lives,” says Jessica M. Bibliowicz, chairman of the Board of Fellows. “There are so many opportunities for us to collaborate with world-class researchers and clinicians in our own ZIP code, as well as across the country and around the world. Collaboration is who we are, and it’s how we change medicine.” Adds Sanford I. Weill, chairman emeritus of Weill Cornell Medicine’s Board of Fellows and campaign co-chair: “Weill Cornell Medicine’s world- class physicians, scientists and students are making tremendous strides every day to ensure that patients around the globe receive the best medical care. Leveraging our strengths and sharing our talents with the world, we’re changing medicine for the better, but there is always more work to do. By further investing in what makes us special, we can realize our new vision of healthcare. I am so excited about what we can—and must—accomplish together with this new campaign.” Dr. Hugh Hemmings Already, generous philanthropic investments over decades have enabled Weill Cornell Medicine to translate breakthrough research discoveries into providing world-class patient care. Campaign leaders expect that the latest fundraising will help the institution’s physicians and scientists make further strides that once would have been unachievable, enabling them to care for patients and their families over the course of their lives. “For four generations—now including my grandchildren—my family has benefited from the extraordinary medical care and scientific innovation that flourish at this institution,” Jeffrey Feil, vice chair of the Board of Fellows and campaign co-chair, said in remarks at the June 17 launch. “What makes Weill Cornell so special is the people—doctors and researchers—and the relationships that are forged over time. Through the We’re Changing Medicine campaign , we will support our remarkable healers.” The Place to Change Medicine The “secret sauce” that enables Weill Cornell Medicine to change medicine is its uniquely interconnected research, education and patient care infrastructures, according to Dr. Augustine M.K. Choi , the Stephen and Suzanne Weiss Dean of Weill Cornell Medicine. “Weill Cornell Medicine has a one-of-a-kind culture that makes anything possible. Our culture of collaboration and teamwork—widely acknowledged on our campus and beyond—breaks down silos and fosters unique discoveries that impact our patients’ lives,” Dr. Choi said in his remarks at the launch event, which occurred virtually from the Belfer Research Building. “Exciting advances in foundational sciences, genomics, artificial intelligence, population health science and other data-centric technologies have opened a new frontier of opportunity for our students and faculty. And most importantly, we have the opportunity to provide novel impactful diagnostics and therapeutics for our patients. Weill Cornell Medicine is ready to leverage these new possibilities and launch a new era of biomedicine and healthcare.” Dr. Robert Min To realize this vision, the institution will invest in construction of new and expanded laboratory space across disease areas, advanced technology for precision health and artificial intelligence (AI), and recruitment and retention of top physician-scientists from around the world. “To be at the cutting edge in discovery and treatment, we need to support the most advanced, most sensitive, most high-resolution techniques available,” says Dr. Hugh C. Hemmings , senior associate dean for research and chair of anesthesiology at Weill Cornell Medicine and anesthesiologist-in-chief at NewYork- Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center. “We have to invest broadly and facilitate interdisciplinary research, because any of our talented scientists could make the next discovery that will change patients’ lives.” The aim of these investments is to expand federal research funding and advance care in high-priority areas like cardiology, metabolic health, cancer, brain health and women’s and children’s health. “We have all had a front-row seat during the pandemic to the power of science, and what it allows us to accomplish,” says Dr. Barbara Hempstead , dean of the Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences and the O. Wayne Isom Professor of Medicine, referring to the speed at which scientists around the world collaborated to sequence the SARS-CoV-2 genome and create effective COVID vaccines. “I can’t think of a better time for us to invest in science that will transform patient care.” The Weill Cornell Medicine vision of changing medicine is centered around making patients partners in their care, says Dr. Rainu Kaushal , senior associate dean for clinical research and chair of the Department of Population Health Sciences: “We can take insights from our patients and from their data and use that to make important research breakthroughs, and on the order of weeks to months, reintroduce that into practice to transform the way we’re delivering medicine.” In addition, investing in powerful, transparent and ethical methods of collecting, analyzing and storing patient data represents an unparalleled opportunity for clinical care at the population level—including the development and use of precision health techniques—to account for the diversity of New York City. “Our investments in precision health will allow us to utilize data on patients’ risks, behaviors and environment in order to reduce disparities, promote health equity and enable everyone to attain their full health potential,” says Dr. Robert J. Min , president and CEO of the Weill Cornell Medicine Physician Organization, chair of radiology at Weill Cornell Medicine, and radiologist-in-chief at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center. “This is a top priority for Weill Cornell Medicine.” Weill Cornell Medicine is also making a long-term investment in education by recruiting students from historically excluded communities, to train a healthcare workforce that better reflects the country’s demographics. A significant piece of this strategy is funding the endowment for Weill Cornell Medical College’s two-year-old debt-free program, which ensures future physicians and scientists can access medical education regardless of ability to pay for it. “Diverse care teams lead to more innovation and creativity and better health outcomes for patients, and diverse communities are more likely to trust the system when they see we have a workforce that represents all of society,” says Dr. Linnie Golightly , associate dean of diversity and an associate professor of clinical medicine and of medicine in microbiology and immunology. “This is why at Weill Cornell, we must invest in recruiting students from historically disadvantaged populations and teaching and mentoring all of our students to provide culturally sensitive care across populations.” Precision Medicine and the Future of Precision Health Weill Cornell Medicine’s Englander Institute for Precision Medicine is at the forefront of using computational biology to tailor the treatment of cancer, working closely with the Meyer Cancer Center and researchers in molecular and genomic pathology. “Precision medicine is a whole new way to think about and treat cancer,” says Dr. Olivier Elemento , director of the Englander Institute, a professor of physiology and biophysics and of computational genomics in pathology and laboratory medicine, and a member of the Meyer Cancer Center. “We now have access to technologies like high-throughput sequencing that help us scan entire genomes in just a few hours and understand what is driving the disease within each patient.” Unlike treatments that use a blanket strategy of radiation or chemotherapy to destroy tumors, precision medicine is about creating a therapy that targets a particular mutation, which varies from patient to patient. “The idea is to gain insights into the disease you’re treating, so if the patient’s tumor is expressing a gene or protein that is mutated, and we fully under- stand its biological function, we can target it specifically,” says Dr. Massimo Loda, chair of the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine, pathologist-in-chief at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center, and deputy director of the Meyer Cancer Center. “Then ideally we develop a therapy that is precise for that patient.” In order to radically improve diagnostic and treatment capabilities and develop strategies tailored to the individual patient, Weill Cornell Medicine is investing in an expansion of precision medicine that goes well beyond cancer. This effort will require the expertise of physician-scientists at the Meyer Cancer Center and others in computational biology, data science, genomics and epi-genomics, population health sciences, cancer, pathology and clinical research, as well as massive computing power to collect and aggregate information from genetic sequencing, imaging, pathology labs and other sources. Using this information, clinicians can identify high-risk patients and recommend early intervention strategies to not just treat but prevent disease—a concept called precision health. “The future of medicine is about applying precision health to every disease,” says Dr. Elemento. “Whole genome sequencing will allow us to understand how to treat illnesses like diabetes and heart disease and how to match each patient to the right therapy based on his or her genes and how to prevent such diseases from occurring in the first place.” Dr. Yoon Kang One preview of what’s to come is an AI model developed by Englander Institute scientists to automate the process of analyzing radiology images and mapping them to biopsy results. This can be used to predict, for instance, whether someone has an aggressive form of cancer. “Through investment in AI and machine learning, we’re going to have diagnostic capabilities far beyond what we can do today, and we’ll be able to target therapies in ways that will allow us to treat more diseases more safely and with shorter recovery periods,” says Dr. Min, also a member of the Meyer Cancer Center. “These are advances we’re on the cusp of attaining.” Health Beyond the Hospital In a related effort, Weill Cornell Medicine scientists are conducting bold research to understand its diverse patient population. Data scientists, epidemiologists and informaticists have the capability to aggregate and analyze massive amounts of population data such as where someone lives, their environmental exposures and their electronic health record information. “The way in which we deliver healthcare across the country has not caught up yet to the explosion in data,” says Dr. Kaushal. “That’s why it’s urgent for us to invest in data science, to understand our patients’ lives outside the hospital.” Analyzing information from a variety of sources—including de-identified data from electronic health records, patients’ responses to mobile health applications, and government data on social and economic conditions in the neighborhoods of Weill Cornell Medicine patient populations—clinicians can recognize health disparities and take action. For example, after identifying characteristics that put people at higher risk of cancer, Weill Cornell Medicine care teams have conducted outreach to help at-risk patients attain screening. They’ve also acted on data showing some patients had limited transportation to their healthcare facilities by assigning care managers to their homes. “A lot of this work focuses on very vulnerable patients who have significant interaction with the healthcare system that could be averted or prevented,” says Dr. Kaushal. Committing to Health Equity and Anticipating the Next Pandemic Weill Cornell Medicine’s long-standing commitment to diversity and inclusion positioned the institution to meaningfully address the race and ethnic disparities amplified during the pandemic and the social justice movement of 2020. Researchers put out findings early on showing COVID-19 infections were concentrated in overcrowded neighborhoods. In the spring and summer of 2020, diversity leadership held weekly virtual town halls to address racial inequity in infection and death as well as larger structural inequalities that predicted the pandemic fallout. In response to conversations from town halls and other community meetings, Dean Choi put forward a list of concrete steps to promote anti-racism at Weill Cornell Medicine. Dr. Augustine M.K. Choi The institution is currently working to vaccinate over 100,000 New Yorkers in underserved areas with the help of medical student vaccinators. To address hesitancy, trainings were provided so clinicians can answer patients’ vaccine questions. An NIH grant is funding a multidisciplinary investigation of inequities in COVID outcomes based on race and socioeconomic status. “The historic events of the last year have made our action on diversity, inclusion and anti-racism more important than ever,” says Dr. Golightly. Part of an equitable approach to healthcare means anticipating future pandemics, which, like COVID, may have worse effects on those who are socially disadvantaged. When COVID hit New York in March 2020, research and clinical teams across the institution worked at unprecedented speed to treat the growing number of infected patients. The Division of Infectious Diseases, which has a history of running large NIH-funded clinical trials on treatments and vaccines for infectious diseases, pivoted quickly. Weill Cornell Medicine became the only site in New York City to run a clinical trial of the highly effective Moderna vaccine, which, along with Pfizer’s, was the first to be authorized for emergency use. The infectious disease team also decided in March 2020 to study remdesivir, one of the earliest medications found to treat COVID-19 symptoms. Specialists in areas like pulmonology, rheumatology, infectious diseases, hematology and obstetrics/gynecology worked together to create standards of care on intubation, blood clotting, postpartum care and cancer treatment. Weill Cornell Medicine scientists also made some of the earliest findings on risk factors for severe COVID such as obesity, and created models relied on by the New York state government to monitor the infection rate. Across disciplines, researchers have published findings illuminating long-haul symptoms of the virus including neurological disorders, lung pathology and heart damage, as well as research showing the virus’s distinct epigenetic signature. “The collaboration has been truly phenomenal here,” says Dr. Roy M. Gulick , chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases and the Rochelle Belfer Professor in Medicine. “I have been at Weill Cornell for 23 years; COVID-19 opened doors and introduced me to people I’d never met before.” In a globalized world, the next pandemic is not a question of “if,” but “when.” For this reason, Weill Cornell Medicine plans to invest in infectious disease research and training to develop vaccination and immunization tools for future infectious diseases as well as existing viruses. This will include expanding virology laboratories and advancing clinical research projects within Weill Cornell Medicine global health initiatives in Brazil, Ghana, Haiti and Tanzania, where infectious disease experts have already made advances on HIV/AIDS, hepatitis, malaria and tuberculosis. “We know there’s likely to be another infectious disease that could spread around the world again, and we want to be ready,” Dr. Gulick says. “We need laboratory scientists who can apply their tools to the next big threat, clinical research to test new drugs, and clinicians who are ready to take whatever next challenge comes along.” Dr. Barbara Hempstead The Future of Pediatric Research In the last year, Weill Cornell Medicine obstetrician/gynecologists, pathologists and microbiologists have helped set the standard of care for pregnant mothers through findings on how antibodies and vaccines are transferred between mother and child to confer some immunity to COVID-19. “Our work is focused on learning about the maternal and infant immune systems, vaccinating mothers to prevent viruses from being transmitted to the baby and leveraging the unique qualities of the infant immune system for protection that will last throughout life,” says Dr. Sallie Permar ,  chair of pediatrics at Weill Cornell Medicine and pediatrician-in-chief at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center, who was recruited to Weill Cornell Medicine as the Nancy C. Paduano Professor of Pediatrics. The capital campaign will support expanding pediatric research initiatives such as bio-banking and a virology and vaccine center, so scientists can develop COVID-19 vaccines and others targeted for maternal and infant immune systems. Investments will go toward recruiting pediatric clinicians and researchers who will collaborate with scientists in the Drukier Institute for Children’s Health. “An important lesson has come out of this time: we can’t leave vulnerable populations as the last piece of the research,” says Dr. Permar. “We are not just changing medicine for one hospitalized child but for a community of children—not only in New York City but around the globe.” A Dynamic Biomedical Corridor The vision of the We’re Changing Medicine campaign will be reflected through architectural changes on the York Avenue biomedical corridor, the heart of Weill Cornell Medicine’s medical campus. Changes will include new laboratories in the Belfer Research Building and an upgrade to basic, translational and clinical labs at 1300 York Avenue, to accommodate the growth of research programs. The lobby at 1300 York will be opened up to create a livelier and more accessible entrance for patients, faculty, students and staff, and renovations to Uris Auditorium will encourage community events on campus. Philanthropy allows academic medical centers like Weill Cornell Medicine to advance quickly and prepare for the future. With more than $750 million in commitments for the We’re Changing Medicine campaign already secured, meeting the $1.5 billion target through philanthropic donations is essential to realize its lofty goals. “Weill Cornell is already changing medicine every day, and through this fundraising campaign we can go even further,” Dr. Choi said in his campaign launch remarks. “Transformational growth like this could not happen without an extraordinary community of devoted individuals. Through these strategic efforts, we will continue to change medicine for the better—because we can. And because our patients need us, we must.” Equal Opportunities Making a Weill Cornell Medicine education affordable to all Weill Cornell Medicine’s debt-free medical education program represents a historic effort to level the playing field for future physicians. In 2019, Weill Cornell Medical College replaced student loans with scholarships that cover tuition, housing and other living expenses so students can attend the top- ranked medical school regardless of their economic background. Briana Lui That year, during the campaign’s quiet phase, a lead gift from The Starr Foundation, chaired by Weill Cornell Medicine Board of Fellows member Maurice R. Greenberg—in partnership with gifts from The Weill Family Foundation, created by Joan and Sanford I. Weill, and other generous donors that together totaled $160 million—established a game-changing scholarship program that provides debt-free education to medical students in financial need. The We’re Changing Medicine campaign will raise $46 million for an endowment so it continues in perpetuity. “Since its founding in 1955, The Starr Foundation has donated hundreds of millions of dollars to scholarship funds around the world, but our grant to Weill Cornell is the largest in our history,” says Greenberg, chairman of The Starr Foundation. “We are pleased to help Weill Cornell students who otherwise would graduate from medical school with significant debt.” According to a JAMA study earlier this year published by Dr. Yoon Kang , senior associate dean for education and others, the program impacted the diversity of the Class of 2024—the first incoming class to benefit from it. Compared with an average from the preceding four classes, the percentage of students from underrepresented minority groups rose from 20 to 29 percent and those from public colleges increased from 24 to 35 percent. “New York City provides an incredibly diverse and enriched living and learning environment for our medical students, and the York Avenue scientific and clinical care corridor offers an astounding opportunity for our students to grow and discover,” Dr. Kang says. “For students who may not have thought about coming to medical school, the debt-free initiative gives them that opportunity—and ultimately creates diverse thought leadership in medicine.” Free of debt, students are empowered to choose a specialty based not on how lucrative it is, but on their passion. The support has been transformational for Briana Lui ’24, a medical student from Queens who is interested in working to reduce health disparities as a physician. “It was a miracle that Weill Cornell had the debt-free initiative when I was applying,” says Lui. “I wouldn’t be able to pursue a career in medicine if the school didn’t have this pro- gram. Having the school’s support relieves not just a financial burden but an emotional one.” Living & Learning New student housing will be more than just a dorm Tom Rosetti When students decide to attend Weill Cornell Medicine, one of their biggest concerns is finding housing in New York City. That’s why Weill Cornell Medicine’s We’re Changing Medicine campaign is supporting the construction of a new student residence at the corner of East 74th Street and York Avenue. “As medical and graduate students pursue their biomedical training, it is critical to provide them with a nurturing living and learning environment,” says Jeffrey Feil, Board of Fellows vice chair and campaign co-chair, who with the Feil Family donated $55 million to support its construction. “We are thrilled to support this new residence hall, which will encourage a culture of innovation, collegiality, and collaboration to inspire our future leaders to keep changing medicine.” The proposed 148,000-square-foot building will feature spacious apartments and modern amenities to enhance student life for MD, MD-PhD, and PhD students. It will have amenities including a fitness center, meeting rooms and places for students to relax, and will give students more housing options within blocks of the medical campus. “We expect an awful lot of our students: they’re expected to do their best, to work hard, and to dream big,” says Dr. Barbara Hempstead, dean of the Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences and the O. Wayne Isom Professor of Medicine. “We need to be able to support them as they strive to meet those expectations and having a state-of-the-art residence hall is key to us helping them to do that.” Tom Rossetti, a doctoral student in pharmacology who volunteers with recruitment for the Graduate School of Medical Sciences, says housing options are a key factor in prospective students’ choice of medical and graduate programs. “It’s extremely important to the students if they know they don’t have to worry about housing,” he says. “Weill Cornell Medicine gives students the tools to succeed, and housing is one of them—not only does it make graduate school more affordable, it reinforces the nurturing, genuinely happy community that made it my top choice to become a scientist.” Dr. Augustine M.K.

As well, the company is pleased to announce automated abandon cart notification and order experience enhancements to its online ordering platform. Smart Upsell is an AI-based tool that generates real-time recommendations based on what customers have added to their online cart. It also allows restaurants to upsell specific items, which can be especially useful for the introduction of new menu items to customers. Zuppler uses machine learning algorithms to evaluate all the orders from customers and then generates recommendations based on what items are frequently ordered together. Recommendations constantly improve as the restaurant receives more orders, which helps the food provider increase transaction averages. For example, when a customer orders a Sandwich , the system will query the historical order database, which indicates 200 people ordered Chips together with Sandwiches and would recommend Chips as the suggested item. If a customer adds Chips to the cart, the system would then check what items are ordered together with Chips and Sandwiches to provide the next suggestion. These suggestions are intelligent, continually improving and based on the merchant's historical order data. ""Consumer adoption of online food ordering has grown exponentially in the past 24 months, and as a result, more consumers are visiting the websites of restaurants looking to order food for pickup and delivery,"" states Shiva Srinivasan, CEO of Zuppler. ""The challenge for restaurants is that fewer than 5% of visitors to online menus will complete their transaction online, or a loss of 95% of potential transactions. Zuppler continues to address this challenge and aggregated data shows a 13.3% higher ticket average for restaurants that use our upsell functionality."" Story continues Visit this article - Smart Upsell — to view how recommendations will appear in the menu. Additional industry stats: 60% of U.S. consumers order delivery or takeout once a week . 34% of consumers spend at least $50 per order when ordering food online. 20% of consumers say they spend more on off-premise orders compared to a regular dine-in experience. Digital ordering and delivery have grown 300% faster than dine-in traffic since 2014. 70% of consumers say they'd rather order directly from a restaurant 's website , preferring that their money goes straight to the restaurant and not a third party. In addition to a long list of product updates in the last quarter, the company has added an abandoned cart email notification that alerts customers to complete the checkout process when items are added to the cart but not processed in a defined period of time. Automated survey and feedback emails can also be configured to be sent automatically via the Zuppler Customer Connect functionality. Finally, to increase on-page conversions, Zuppler has added fully customizable images, banner advertisements and other dynamic promotions that are directly integrated into the branded online ordering menu. In combination, these enhancements will assist restaurants and other food operators in creating an amazing online ordering experience that is simple, efficient and intuitive.

Model optimization methods to cut latency, adapt to new data This last part of the series on machine learning explains two final model optimization techniques: lightweight model implementation and incremental model learning. Share this item with your network: By Arcitura Education Guest Contributor Published: 14 Sep 2021 This article is excerpted from the course ""Fundamental Machine Learning,"" part of the Machine Learning Specialist certification program from Arcitura Education. It is the final part of the 13-part series, ""Using machine learning algorithms, practices and patterns."" In this, the conclusion of our machine learning series, we cover two more machine learning model optimization techniques -- specifically, the lightweight model implementation and incremental model learning techniques. These final two techniques conclude this series' coverage of model optimization practices. As explained in Part 4, these techniques are documented in a standard pattern profile format. Lightweight model implementation: Overview How can prediction latency be kept to a minimum in a real-time data processing system while guaranteeing acceptable accuracy? A complex model with high accuracy generally incurs high prediction latency when deployed in real-time systems, leading to degraded system performance with the further consequences of potential business loss. A lightweight model with acceptable accuracy is trained and deployed to make real-time predictions. Application . A statistical or a simple machine learning algorithm, such as naive Bayes, is used to train a predictive model that is then deployed in the real-time system to make low latency predictions. Lightweight model implementation: Explained Problem A real-time data processing system, such as an event stream processing (ESP) system, requires minimum possible delay from the time the data gets ingested to the time the predictions become available. However, with the aim of achieving maximum possible accuracy, which generally results in a complex model, prediction time increases. Although the system generates accurate results, by the time the results are accessible the window of opportunity may already have closed. In a very high-velocity data processing system, such as with an IoT-driven system, not only does this incur prediction lag but also results in excessive use of memory and processing resources. (See Figure 1.) Figure 1. A training data set is prepared (1). It is then used to train a model (2). The result is a complex model (3). The model is deployed to a real-time prediction system (4). Streaming data enters the real-time prediction system at time t-0 (5). At time t-1, the real-time prediction system makes the first prediction related to the first data point, and at time t-2 the real-time prediction system makes the second prediction, and so on (6). However, the time taken to make each prediction results in high latency (7). Solution A real-time system suffers from the limitations described by the speed consistency volume (SCV) principle. To be able to operate at high velocity (S) while making sure that all data gets processed (V), the accuracy of the predictions needs to be relaxed (C) by employing a lightweight model. Such models are either probability-based or use a linear classifier to keep the memory and computation overhead to a minimum. Although the accuracy of such models is not on par with complex models, their ability to predict faster offsets the reduced accuracy. To reduce false positives or to gain further insight into the data points, the data points can then be fed to a more complex model operating at near-real-time that may make use of other contextual data not available to the real-time prediction pipeline. Application Based on whether the nature of a problem is regression or classification, a lightweight algorithm is chosen. With regression, linear regression or a pruned decision tree can be used; with classification, logistic regression, linear support vector machine (SVM) or naive Bayes can be used to train a model in an offline manner by making use of as much data as possible. The trained model can then be deployed in the real-time system. With IoT devices , once the lightweight classification model predicts that a data value falls within a class of interest or if the regression model's prediction falls within the range of interest, one strategy to gain insight or to confirm the model's prediction is to reconfigure the IoT device to gather more granular data that can then be fed to complex models, such as kernel SVM. The same strategy can also be employed for non-IoT systems. The use of complex models as a second stage may also be required when there is a requirement for the prediction to be explainable to a decision maker or a third-party, such as the detection of fraudulent bank transactions. Models based on rule-centered algorithms, such as decision trees and classification rules, can be used in such scenarios. The lightweight model implementation pattern can further benefit from the application of the incremental model learning pattern as it helps keep retraining time and resources to a minimum, which further helps when updating the productionalized model more frequently, thereby achieving more accurate predictions. (See Figure 2.) Figure 2. A training data set is prepared (1). It is then used to train a model using a lightweight algorithm (2). This results in a lightweight model (3). The model is then deployed to a real-time prediction system (4). Streaming data enters the real-time prediction system at time t-0 (5). At time t-1, the real-time prediction system makes the first prediction related to the first data point, and at time t-2 the real-time prediction system makes the second prediction, and so on (6). The latency that occurs as a result of making predictions is minimal (7). Incremental model learning: Overview How can a model be retrained without having to be trained from scratch when new data is acquired? After the initial training of a model, it is imperative that the model is retrained as new data becomes available. However, this retraining can take a long time and can use excessive processing resources, thereby risking the availability of an up-to-date model in a timely fashion. A classifier that is not dependent on historical data and only requires new data for retraining is deployed to make predictions. An incremental classifier such as naive Bayes is used where the model is updated based on new example data only without the need for regenerating the whole model from scratch. Incremental model learning: Explained Problem After the initial training and deployment of a model, the effectiveness of the model remains within the expected bounds as long as the model's input remains comparatively similar in its behavior when compared with the data that was originally used to train the model. However, the characteristics of the input data often change over time. Consequently, as prescribed by the frequent model retraining pattern, the model needs to be retrained. Based on the available processing resources and the required retraining frequency, the retraining can take considerable time and use a large volume of processing resources. This increases the potential of using a less-accurate model for longer in the production system before the up-to-date model becomes available. (See Figure 3.) Figure 3. A training data set is prepared (1). It is then used to train a model (2, 3). The training process takes a long time to complete (4). After a certain period, another training data set is prepared (5). The newly prepared data set is used to retrain the model (6, 7). The retraining process takes the same amount of time to complete as the training process (8). Solution The increased use of processing resources, which translates into both increased cost and time, can generally be attributed to the re-computational nature of the underlying algorithm used for model training. Such an algorithm requires the complete data set for retraining purposes. For example, with K-nearest neighbors (K-NN), whenever a new data point is fed to the model, the algorithm scans the entire data set to find the K number of the most similar data points based on the Euclidean, Hamming or Cosine distance measures . In order to decrease the retraining time, an incremental classifier is employed. Such a classifier is built on top of an algorithm that does not need to go through the entire data set again whenever the model needs to be retrained. Instead, the model keeps the previous state and updates the state based on computations made on the new data. Application An incremental machine learning algorithm such as naive Bayes is used to train a model based on the entire data set at the beginning. However, after the initial deployment of the model, once there is a need to retrain the model, only the newly acquired data is fed into the model retraining process. The underlying algorithms are able to support this functionality as they generally make some assumptions and are probabilistic rather than deterministic. For example, naive Bayes assumes that all features are equal in importance and calculates the probability of each feature independently of other features. This way, it does not need to recalculate the probabilities from scratch and can keep the state of previously computed probabilities and only needs to update the probabilities when new examples are fed. The application of this pattern is dependent upon the availability of the incremental version of the underlying algorithm, which may not be possible in all scenarios. Also, business requirements may impose constraints that make the use of incremental algorithms unsuitable. For example, replacing a decision-tree classification model with a naive Bayes classification model may not be a possibility if the business requires the use of an explainable model rather than a black box model (Figure 4). Figure 4. A training data set is prepared (1). An incremental algorithm is used to train a model. Once it is trained, the model's state is kept (2, 3, 4). The training process takes a long time to complete (5). After a certain period of time, another training data set is prepared (6). The newly prepared data set is used to retrain the model (7). During the retraining process, the old state of the model is first retrieved (8). Once the training is complete, the updated state is saved (9); this results in a retrained model (10). The retraining process takes considerably less time to complete than the original training time (11). This concludes our 13-part series on how machine learning works.

Free Workshop / Seminar Presented By: The Center for the Study of Complex Systems Complex Systems Seminar | Designing fair machine learning: ditch the fair and ditch the machine learning Efrén Cruz Cortés, Postdoctoral Research Fellow Michigan Institute for Data Science (MIDAS) Efrén Cruz Cortés Headshot VIRTUAL SEMINAR - ZOOM MEETING LINK (see also links below) https://umich.zoom.us/j/96616169868 Meeting ID: 966 1616 9868 Passcode: CSCS Abstract: Implementation of machine learning algorithms in decision making is, for the most part, (in)famously accompanied by the reproduction of social bias and discrimination, often based on race or gender, causing further harm to already disadvantaged populations. The dominant paradigm of ""fair machine learning"" proposes tweaking loss minimization or processing observed data to guarantee fairness. However, this approach is limited, as it fails to capture the ecology in which technology unfolds, therefore masking social and institutional structures that cement such discrimination independently and in spite of algorithmic tweaking. I will provide examples of racial discrimination in judicial and financial systems and the need for contextual analysis. I will then discuss the promising avenue of causal inference through which the relationship between system structure and unethical algorithm deployment can be better understood and leveraged for policy making. In the spirit of the title, I will also explain the panoply of failures standard causal inference exhibits, notably its overreliance on observational data (to the expense of a generative mechanism) and its over-overreliance on variable attributes as accurate representations of an individual (to the expense of the network of social relationships such individual is embedded in and defined by), I will then discuss ways in which complexity science can help resolve such shortcomings. Time permitting I will try to say something good about uncritically and blindly applying machine learning to all aspects of life, but I don't guarantee it.

The concept of artificial intelligence or machines that aim to emulate human thinking is undergoing vigorous research and is a topic that is increasingly being associated with the Internet of things. An AI enabled IoT system extends the functionality and value of an organization’s offering, without the need for committing additional resources to achieve the increased value. This is exemplified by under Armour(UA) and IBM’s collaboration on the UA Record app, which is an AI-based personal fitness coaching system, that uses a variety of sensor data to suggest highly personalized, context-relevant fitness activities to users. Such applications of AI are going to be more commonplace in the future as they are already having a significant impact on many industries. Here are a few application areas that you can consider for AI implementation : 1. Customer Engagement As businesses, especially in the service sector industries, evolve from the basic transactional model of customer interaction to a more continuous engagement sequence, the role of IoT and artificial intelligence is rapidly gaining importance. For example, the use of digital concierge and virtual assistants is being discussed in the hospitality industry to automate, personalize and streamline interactions between guests and the service delivery system. The trial deployment of an AI assistant at the Munich airport that helps visitors with directions is an example that forebodes the use of AI in similar cases and for broader purposes in the future. Improved engagement can also be extended to employees by using virtual employee assistants to ensure continued connectivity and simplified task execution. 2. Predictive Analytics Growing applications of IoT in enterprises has entailed a corresponding increase in the data being generated by the installed systems. This data, continuously collected through the myriad of sensors used in the system, can be used in machine learning models that can be used to make highly informed decisions. The enormity of data volume can be easily managed using AI based data management tools and then be used to derive insights that impact more than just the operational performance. For example, in a healthcare institution, continuous diagnostic analysis is performed to track operational parameters such as the availability of personnel, machines, drugs and other resources; the utilization of different functional units; and the number and types of cases being admitted; to improve responsiveness to changing conditions. AI can be used to perform predictive analysis to ensure preparedness of the facility to respond to different situations and can also be used to provide prescriptive long-term solutions to repetitive issues. 3. Security Systems IoT sensors that scan biometric information to authenticate the identity are already being used by numerous business and government organizations. Combining IoT and AI can make biometric scanning even more  effective and secure by including the recognition of facial features and voice. CCTV cameras used today require a pair of human eyes to monitor the live footage and identify potential threats or to find clues after an incident. AI infused security camera networks enable scanning of multiple parameters including movements  and high risk objects, and automatically raise alarm when a potentially suspicious event occurs. Use of AI surveillance systems like Ella, which finds and distinguishes video footage elements for easy identification of suspicious or missing items, is one way AI can be used for enhanced security. 4. Process Automation Manufacturing automation has been one of the earliest areas of application of robotics and artificial intelligence. A manufacturing process operated by an AI control system, that is linked to sources of different kinds of data, from the demand in market to the availability of parts from vendors; can function with maximum efficiency, as the process can be regulated through real-time analysis of data. Even service organizations such as restaurants can automate processes by using automated kitchen robots for cooking that emulates human chefs. 5. Artificial Creativity Artificial creativity is the concept of using algorithms that allow machines to produce content that is random yet desirable for human perception. Multiple online services that provide AI  compositions to inspire or completely create new content are already available, and are indicative of a future where an increasing portion of creative content will be inspired or created by AI technology. The focus of AI implementation at present must be to minimize human involvement in the routine and non-creative tasks, so that human effort can be directed towards innovation and planning, where AI can be used for guidance. Following the lead of industry leaders, organizations aiming for sustained relevance should prepare for the use of AI based technology, embedded in an IoT foundation.

Credit... Apple By Jack Nicas Sept. 14, 2021, 2:37 p.m. ET It is a story that now happens just about every September: Apple introduced new iPhones that have slightly bigger screens, faster speeds and better cameras — but no new major advances. In a prerecorded infomercial, Apple executives framed the improvements in the new iPhone 13 as significant innovations, but they result in a device that looks and performs much like the iPhones that Apple touted last year. Apple said the new iPhones have a brighter screen, longer battery life and more powerful cameras and computer processors. Having already pushed the screen nearly to the edge of the device, Apple slightly increased its size by reducing the small notch at the top of the screen. Apple kept the same flat-edge design of the phone that it has used in other recent models. Apple is hoping that by adding new features and making slight design improvements, customers will keep shelling out more money. It is a strategy that has worked for a long time. The iPhone, now in its 14th year, remains one of the world’s best-selling products and the centerpiece of Apple’s business. Over the first half of the year, the latest period available, Apple said iPhone sales rose 58 percent to $87.5 billion over the same period a year earlier. That success is partly because Apple has built an intensely loyal customer base, and also because it has designed its products in a way that makes it difficult for customers to switch to the competition, like Samsung and Google. The iPhone also remains among the best smartphones on the market in several areas, including camera technology and screen resolution. Apple spent much of its advertisement showing off the iPhone’s new “cinematic mode,” a camera technology that can automatically follow and focus on a subject, resulting in videos that more closely resemble professional movies. Apple’s emphasis on advanced camera technology in its iPhones is a reflection of its hefty investment in artificial intelligence to compete with Google. A few years ago, Google’s Pixel smartphones used the search giant’s prowess in artificial intelligence to leapfrog the iPhone’s camera capabilities. But over the last few years, Apple made several aggressive moves to catch up, acquiring several A.I. start-ups and hiring a top A.I. executive from Google, John Giannandrea. Partly as a result, its newer iPhone cameras have received higher ratings than the Pixel. As in past years, Apple unveiled two separate versions of the new iPhone: the entry-level iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini, and the more expensive and advanced iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max. Apple largely kept prices flat from last year’s models. The dominance of the iPhone has also brought Apple increased scrutiny and criticism from app developers, regulators and lawmakers. Having an iPhone app has become a necessity for many companies, which has enabled Apple to build an enormous business by charging a commission of up to 30 percent on some app sales. But that practice has been at the center of legal and regulatory challenges in recent years. Last week, a federal judge ordered Apple to let app developers direct customers to other payment methods in their apps, which could enable them to avoid Apple’s commission. Regulators in the United States, Europe and India are also investigating Apple’s App Store practices.

The Artificial Intelligence curated exhibition opens with a talk on the development of the AI model followed by a Q&A with the AI Team: IV (Ivan Pravdin) and museum co-founders cari ann shim sham* and Joey Zaza. ""This Show is Curated by a Machine"" runs September 23, 2021 through January 31, 2022 tickets bought prior to opening day, September 23rd, include entrance to AI talk and are available at: https://www.mowna.org/museum/this-show-is-curated-by-a-machine Earlier this year, The Whitney Museum of American Art commissioned and exhibited the work ""The Next Biennial Should Be Curated by a Machine"" for their online artport. In response the Museum of Wild and Newfangled Art has designed an artificial intelligence curator that will not only redefine how we look at curation and AI but will also underscore the need to move forward with AI curation in an ethical way. The artificial intelligence model was trained on image sets from various sources, including the Museum of Modern Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the mowna Biennial submissions, an exhibit of around 88 International Artists from 44 countries. ""Curation is very subjective. It's my hope through the development of an AI curator that we can allow for equity and diversity, and eliminate some biases,"" says cari ann shim sham*. Artists in the show include Alice Prum, a London based artist whose work explores the invisible relationships between space, the body, and technology. Bridget DeFranco is an east coast media artist working against the high-stimulation nature of the screen. Avideh Salmanpour is an Iranian artist whose paintings explore the bewilderment of contemporary man and the attempt to find a new way. The artificial intelligence curator was created by multiple artists. IV is a post-contemporary artist working with various artificial intelligence and neural networking techniques. cari ann shim sham* is the co-founder and curator of mowna, a wild artist working at the intersection of dance and technology, and an associate arts professor of dance and technology at NYU Tisch School of the Arts. Joey Zaza is the co-founder and curator of mowna, and works in photography, software, video, sound, and installation. They combined forces to explore the potential of using artificial intelligence in art curation. The team's initial thoughts, strategies and questions in the development of the AI model can be found on mowna's blog . Human curation is also included alongside the AI curation for ""This Show is Curated by a Machine"" to offer a comparison. Text written by the team will explain why or why not they think the AI chose the work. This show is a successful completion of phase one of mowna's AI model which ranks and curates a show using image based files. mowna will release a paper with its phase one research and findings to the public. With this data the team will enter into phase two development for the AI's ability to curate sound and video files. ""This Show is Curated by a Machine"" will be installed and available for viewing on September 23, 2021 and marks the third online art exhibition by mowna. The second, the 2021 mowna Biennial, showcases art of all mediums and focuses on exhibiting art that might have otherwise gone unseen due to gaps in the post-pandemic art world. It is currently still on exhibit until September 22, 2021 and can be viewed on the mowna website. Tickets are a sliding scale of pay-what-you-wish. mowna makes it their priority to showcase a broad range of art and is committed to diversity in every way. It provides an international online platform for the most timely, diverse, and preeminent artists. At the center of the constantly changing and expanding art world, mowna showcases a mixture of the familiar and unfamiliar. Members will have the opportunity to see artists who have been curated by the MoMA or the Whitney alongside artists available only on mowna. As the global landscape shifts towards a more technological way of being, mowna is there to meet the needs of an ever-changing art world. The Museum of Wild and Newfangled Art was formed to feature the newest art developments and make art of all mediums accessible to everyone. And it unmistakably builds on that foundation with the upcoming exhibition ""This Show is Curated by a Machine"".

By eWEEK EDITORS - September 14, 2021 Share Facebook Twitter Linkedin During the recent Tesla AI Day event, Elon Musk said he discourages “machine learning, because it is really difficult. Unless you have to use machine learning, don’t do it.” Well, Musk may be right in his assessment, because machine learning is quite difficult to implement. Most companies desire the benefits of what artificial intelligence can achieve for their business, but most don’t have what it takes to get it up and running. Therefore, as much as 85% of ML projects currently fail. The takeaway from Musk’s startling statement is that organizations can’t treat AI, of which machine learning is a subset, like a part-time project. Many businesses are making some important mistakes when trying to do AI. But it doesn’t have to be this way. Below are five data points from Bin Zhao, Ph.D., Lead Data Scientist at Datatron, showing some common mistakes of AI implementation. 1. Careful: this isn’t traditional software development Don’t treat AI/ML development like traditional software development. Developing AI/ML models is a much different process than software development, but many organizations try to apply the traditional software development lifecycle to manage AI/ML models. Machine Learning development lifecycle (MLLC) takes much more time because of additional factors including translating AI algorithms to compatible software codes, unique infrastructure requirements, the need for frequent model iterations, and more. Compared to traditional programming languages, it can take more than five times as long. This means today’s typical application release processes are simply not applicable. 2. Using or standardizing the wrong tools can hamper data scientists’ productivity This type of tools mistake introduces unnecessary delays and inefficiencies. In most IT situations, organizations can control the types of servers they buy, the software tools they use, the dependencies they build with and so on. Not so with AI/ML; organizations must allow their data scientists to use their preferred tools based on what they think will get the job done in the best way. Otherwise, they’re likely to see all their data scientists leave. 3. IT/DevOps staff can lack ML expertise DevOps is the union of software development and operations with the goals of reducing solution delivery time and sustaining a good user experience through automation (e.g. CI/CD and monitoring). But DevOps experts don’t know the nuances of working with ML models. MLOps is a new term that expresses how to apply DevOps rules to automate the building, testing and deployment of ML systems. The goal of MLOps is to unite ML application development and the operation of ML applications, making it easier for groups to deploy finer models more often. 4. Beware of the misalignment of the skill sets of data scientists Data scientists need the right raw data for modeling, and they excel in uncovering data to build the best models to solve business challenges. However, that does not mean they are experts in all the intricacies of deploying models to work with existing applications and infrastructure. This causes friction between them and the engineering team and business leaders, resulting in low job satisfaction for data scientists. Though highly skilled and trained, they must rely on others for deployment and production, which also means that they can’t iterate rapidly. And since the projects shift to the engineering team, who don’t have the ML skill set, it’s easy for them to miss details – especially if the model is not making accurate predictions. 5. Don’t get too caught up in the romance of academic AI research vs. business reality Academic AI research has historically focused on developing models and algorithms. Limited efforts have been devoted towards iterating and improving data sets for a specific business problem, operationalizing a machine learning model or monitoring models in production. Building and deploying a machine learning model for solving a real world problem is much more than developing the algorithm itself. A sound plan for ML success Operationalizing ML models is hard but not impossible. Using a new model development life cycle will streamline the process of model development and model production. It does this by helping data scientists, engineering and other involved teams make effective decisions in a timely manner. It will also help teams to reduce production risks. A successful model governance tool can also help by standardizing processes, simplifying governance and significantly reducing risks.

In a previous paper, Dashun Wang and a team of researchers had proven the existence of hot streaks. “In scientific careers, we see that it is in a four to five year period where scientists publish their best work,” he said. “Ninety percent of scientists experience a hot streak, and it usually happens once.” But one discovery complicated his findings. “There is equal probability that the hot streak could occur in the beginning, middle, or end of a career,” Wang said. “It seemed like a random magical period.” This puzzle set the team on a three-year journey to understand what kinds of conditions precede a hot streak.

In particular, they were looking to see if exploration or exploitation best predicted periods of peak creativity . For the researchers, exploitation meant focusing on a narrow range of subjects or style, not abuse of some kind. The researchers’ specially designed AI was able to consider the evolution of an artist’s art style over time. It was exposed to 800,000 images culled from museum and gallery collections that represent the careers of 2,128 artists. If the AI detected a lot of variety in style this was termed as a period of exploration, or if the AI detected little variety, it was a period of exploitation. An artist’s hot streak was identified by examining which period of time resulted in the artist’s most expensive works. The scientists found that neither exploration nor exploitation on its own could significantly predict a hot streak, writing, “Not all explorations are fruitful, and exploitation in the absence of promising new ideas may not be as productive.” On the other hand, the researchers did find that a sequence of exploration followed by exploitation could predict hot streaks in the careers of not only artists but filmmakers and scientists too. The researchers cited Jackson Pollock as an example in the paper, saying that the Abstract Expressionist’s hot streak took place between 1946 and 1950, when he produced some of the drip paintings for which he is best known. For Pollock, this era was a time of intense focus on a very specific style, and this, the researchers said, preceded by a good deal of experimentation. “We searched for an answer for three years,” Wang says. “I was surprised the answer was this simple. But the best kind of results are the results that are so obvious once you know the answer.” Read More About: artificial intelligence creativity science Most-Read Stories Scientists Discover the Key to Artistic Success: 'Promising… Algorithm-Generated NFTs Are Quickly Rising in Value.

(AP Photo/Jim Mone) By Dave Skretta | AP Today at 3:55 p.m. EDT By Dave Skretta | AP Today at 3:55 p.m. EDT 0 KANSAS CITY, Mo. — The Kansas City Royals promoted general manager Dayton Moore to president of baseball operations and elevated longtime assistant GM J.J. Picollo to fill his previous role in a front-office shakeup Tuesday that promises a seamless path forward for the rebuilding organization. Support our journalism. Subscribe today Moore, who has been general manager since 2006, will continue to have final say on trades and other roster moves, but Picollo will have a greater voice in the room when it comes to putting together the team. “I’m not a micromanager. We’re going to allow people to do their jobs,” Moore said. “It’s very collaborative, as it always has been, and I think the uniqueness of this relationship is we’ve all worked together for so long.” Story continues below advertisement Indeed, the 54-year-old Moore and the 51-year-old Picollo have worked together for 15 years in Kansas City. Before that, the pair spent time in the Atlanta Braves organization during their heyday in the 1990s. Advertisement “I would be foolish as a first-time general manager not to lean on someone who has sat in that seat,” Picollo said. “We’re fortunate how we’re set up in the front office. That collaboration has always taken place.” Moore presided over one of the most remarkable turnarounds in baseball history, leading the long-suffering Royals from a team that regularly lost 100 games upon his 2006 arrival to one that reached consecutive World Series. And in 2015, they beat the New York Mets in five games for their first championship in 30 years. Story continues below advertisement The Royals have been on another major rebuilding effort after the small-market club was unable to keep some of the big names that ushered in their winning era. But there have been signs that another breakthrough is on the horizon as a wave of talented young pitchers continues to help Kansas City win games down the stretch this season. Advertisement Picollo, who has interviewed for several GM jobs, has long been considered Moore’s heir apparent. “He’s totally prepared. He talks about elevating his role and being more effective and I can’t wait to see that” Royals owner John Sherman said. “J.J. has been an architect of what I would call helping to modernize our baseball operations department over the past few years. He had a lot of help in doing it but when you talk about data science and data capture and all the tools we have for player development, J.J. helped to lead us to that evolution.” Story continues below advertisement The organizational structure is similar to those embraced by about half of big league teams, and has become necessary in part due to the changing business of baseball. The Royals had just 85 employees when Moore arrived, but they now have 266 on the payroll, including such new departments as performance science and behavior science. Advertisement The change should allow Moore to better handle the growing complexity of the organization. “This structure is best practice in our industry now,” Sherman said. “I really expect to get more executive, high-level thinking out of Dayton when we think about the team, and I know the operation of the ballclub is in good hands.” Story continues below advertisement Moore, who grew up a Royals fan in Wichita, began his career as a scout with the Braves. He climbed the ranks to director of international scouting and director of player personnel development, and in 2005 he was given the job of assistant general manager. Then-Royals owner David Glass, who had been pilloried by fans for his inability to turn the Royals around, turned to Moore in June 2006 to finally accomplish the task. Moore decided to invest heavily in Latin America, establishing academies that helped to identify talent, and slowly built the Kansas City farm system into one of the best in the big leagues. Advertisement Still, it took until 2013 before Moore saw the fruits of that labor in Kauffman Stadium. That’s when players such as Eric Hosmer and Mike Moustakas began to get their call-ups, and combined with some nervy moves made by Moore — such as trading away Zack Greinke and acquiring James Shields and Wade Davis — finally put the Royals over the top. Story continues below advertisement They reached the World Series the following year, losing to the Giants in a dramatic series that came down to the final out of Game 7 in Kansas City. And they returned the following year to finish the job, beating the Mets for the championship. Picollo had his fingerprints on those teams, too. The former Braves scout joined the Royals as director of player development in 2006 and, two years later, became the assistant GM in charge of scouting and player development. In that role, Picollo worked closely with the Royals’ entire minor league setup, ushering players from their first steps in pro ball all the way to the majors. Advertisement He was promoted to his current role as vice president and assistant GM in charge of player personnel in 2015, and now he will have an opportunity to finish Moore’s latest rebuilding job in Kansas City. Story continues below advertisement “This structure has been presented a few different times and truthfully, it just wasn’t one that I was personally ready to embrace for a number of reasons,” Moore said. “I began to evaluate our personnel and the different skillsets that are in this front office. We had discussions and laid out the different roles and how we can achieve sustained success as John desires, our fanbase desires and we aspire to, it became very, very clear this was the structure that made the most sense.” ___ More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports 0 Comments Gift Article Today's Headlines The most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.

While continuing his graduate studies in engineering at Purdue University, Mahdi Al-Husseini also is a first lieutenant in the U.S. Army. He serves as an active-duty aeromedical evacuations officer with the 3rd Battalion, 25th Aviation Regiment at Wheeler Army Airfield in Hawaii. Through that experience, he co-developed Aura, a flight-training system, in an effort to reduce the number of aircraft accidents caused by pilot error. (Photo provided/U.S. Army) Download Image WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – Purdue University graduate student Mahdi Al-Husseini thinks his flight-training innovation can help the U.S. military save millions in reduced training time for Army helicopter pilots. Pursuing a graduate degree in Purdue’s Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Al-Husseini and his Stanford University teammate Joshua Barnett have been named finalists in the 2021 Collegiate Inventors Competition . Their dynamic flight-training solution, called Aura, analyzes instrument displays using a pipeline of computer vision and machine learning techniques, then identifies the maneuver being performed and creates performance reports accordingly for in-flight and post-flight review. Al-Husseini and Barnett estimate their system can lead to a 10% reduction in training time for U.S. Army helicopter pilots, potentially saving the Army $106 million per year. “As an active-duty aeromedical evacuations officer for the U.S. Army, I pilot an HH-60M Sikorsky Black Hawk to evacuate wounded soldiers to nearby hospitals,” said Al-Husseini, a first lieutenant in the U.S. Army, serving as an active-duty aeromedical evacuations officer with the 3rd Battalion, 25th Aviation Regiment at Wheeler Army Airfield in Hawaii. “My ability to fly affects not only myself and my crew, but also patients who may require lifesaving care. Aura was developed to ensure improved aviation mission execution and to reduce the number of aircraft accidents caused by pilot error.” Their startup Aura Training Systems won a $25,000 prize in Purdue’s 34th annual Burton D. Morgan Business Model Competition in May. Now, the duo joins five other teams in the graduate division of the Collegiate Inventors Competition . Finalists were selected based on originality of the idea, process, level of student initiative, and potential value and usefulness to society. “Training pilots is an intensive process that ensures plane and helicopter operation is safe,” Al-Husseini and Barnett wrote in their submission. “However, pilots in most aircraft, especially noncommercial, nonpassenger aircraft, lack real-time access to meaningfully processed flight data. Aura is the first tool to allow pilots to track maneuver data dynamically in-flight.” The Purdue-Stanford team will present their invention Oct. 13 in a virtual format to a panel of final-round judges composed of National Inventors Hall of Fame inductees and U.S. Patent and Trademark Office officials. Winning teams will be announced Oct. 14. “I am honored to be selected as a finalist for the 2021 Collegiate Inventors Competition and to represent Purdue University,” Al-Husseini said. “Most importantly, I look forward to continuing to design and prototype new inventions that support our nation’s best – our military service members.” Established in 1990, the competition is a program of the NIHF and is sponsored by the USPTO and Arrow Electronics.

By any measure of value, audience size, or growth, mobile is the dominant form of gaming media . Already immensely popular due to its accessibility and wide range of content, the COVID-19 pandemic created hundreds of millions of new mobile players and increased the playtime and appetite to spend of existing gamers. With over a billion weekly game downloads on the Apple App Store and Google Play , resulting in more than $1.7 billion in weekly spend, the mobile game industry is clearly booming. It’s also super top-heavy, fueled by the significant revenue of a few thousand games; chief among them smash hits such as PUBG Mobile, Coin Master, and Candy Crush. As of August, seven mobile games that pull in over $100 million in an average month. Another 810 gross at least $1 million monthly. These figures are astounding and a testament to world-class game development, intelligent marketing, the virality of quality gaming content, and a little sprinkle of magic dust for luck. Dig a little deeper into the two dominant mobile stores and you’ll see that between them they house around 1.5 million games. Some basic math would suggest that well under 1% of the available games are making approximately a quarter of the revenue. Tough, right? For every successful business startup, there are dozens of others that underperform or go bust. The markets and consumers decide. Well, yes, to a point. The issue for mobile games is that big tech players such as Apple and Google are taking an increasingly privacy-first approach that stacks the odds of success firmly against newcomers and smaller publishers. Even Facebook, for many years the primary source for acquiring new players due to the granularity of its targeting, is rebuilding its ads platform in response to a drop in effectiveness following Apple’s abolishment of its Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA). As the big tech platforms undertake such dramatic shifts in the data they allow advertisers to access, the chances of a new indie game being discovered and becoming a commercial success beyond 2021 are fading further. Webinar Three top investment pros open up about what it takes to get your video game funded. 2021: The privacy-first year For smaller mobile games, pursuing a paid model is a surefire way to stop your game getting off the ground, while achieving the scale to monetize solely with in-app purchases is rare. So monetizing with ads is the primary revenue driver, enabling publishers to generate income from every player. Most mobile games are typically highly reliant on marketing and advertising to get their brand out there and attract and monetize users. While mobile ads aren’t universally well-regarded, the majority of the mobile player base appreciates the value exchange they offer. This value exchange has been powered by access to incredibly granular user data that enables three things: Showing the right ad content to the right user at the right time. Advertising your game to players of other games who are likely to enjoy your content. Attributing installs to a certain marketing channel, i.e., figuring out where your game’s users are coming from, and whether the money you spent on advertising was worthwhile. 2021, and specifically the changes introduced by Apple in its iOS14 update, have thrown the status quo of mobile marketing into disarray. In killing its IDFA in the name of privacy, Apple has drastically limited the user data available to advertisers. This means that games — for so long able to use IDFAs or other user information to link identities through deterministic attribution — can no longer figure out how to effectively acquire new players. While iOS users are able to opt-in to sharing their data with the apps they use – and many consumers who understand the value exchange with their favorite mobile games are doing so – this still only makes up around 25% of iOS users . As a result, deterministic attribution as we know it has been killed off, and advertising spend on iOS subsequently fell by about one-third between June 1 and July 1. Over the same period the spend on Android platforms rose by 10% , with advertisers switching budgets to Google Play and other large Android ecosystems such as Huawei AppGallery or the Samsung Galaxy Store. However, the direction of travel on Android is significantly privacy-first too, meaning the ad spend boom it’s currently experiencing may well be short-lived. When advertisers’ access to granular user data is curtailed on Android, it’s fair to say mobile gaming’s business model will be significantly damaged. WTF is data science anyway? Above: Let’s go fishing — for mobile marketing tactics! Image Credit: Kawlee While games are now lacking familiar user data to inform their marketing, they certainly aren’t lacking other data sources. In fact, they’re absolutely drowning in data — it’s just that it’s aggregated, hard to analyze and has rarely been used before by the majority of app publishers. The cold, hard currency of clicks has been replaced by elusive signals that need to be teased out. This means that the importance of data has never been as great as it is today, or more accurately, the ability to turn data into insight. Publishers that were relying  solely on Mobile Measurement Partners (MMPs) to acquire the best players are in disarray because crucial insights are simply no longer available. These third parties no longer have all the answers, meaning games’ tried-and-tested growth strategies are paralyzed and the era of MMP-centric marketing is over. Indies, small, and even medium-sized game developers are finding themselves Googling stuff like “data science for user acquisition”. Large, multinational publishers like Zynga, Rovio, and King are far better-placed to adapt to the new normal. They have sizable data science and research & development departments mining user insights in-house. With access to significant amounts of capital, they can likewise bring more data and more users into their ecosystems by acquiring smaller publishers. Zynga has recently bought Rollic Games, while Rovio purchased Ruby Games — both successful Turkish studios and publishers. To bridge the gap, most publishers are resorting to a technique called fingerprinting, a bootlegged form of probabilistic attribution that doesn’t rely on deterministic user-level data. But this only works for ad networks that use links in their ads, meaning it does not work for Facebook, Google, or Snapchat. Apple has come out against fingerprinting, and it’s not unlikely that it will be shut down for privacy reasons on iOS15. Even if it doesn’t, the effectiveness of fingerprinting will decline due to the release of iOS15’s Private Relay service, which basically removes the main probabilistic signal for users with iCloud – their IP address. So, game over for indies, then? Above: No, this isn’t a reminder for tax day. It’s for iOS 15. Image Credit: Apple Ninety-nine percent of publishers simply don’t have access to in-house data scientists or the reported $100 million development and marketing budget of runaway successes like Genshin Impact. So beyond praying that cloud gaming or subscription services like Apple Arcade suddenly achieve the scale needed to meaningfully disrupt the market, or hoping to be talent-spotted by a large studio, are smaller mobile games destined to fail? Not necessarily, because when Apple closes a door, it opens a window. I’ll keep it light, but iOS15 will put all SKAdNetwork data — marketing data that comes from Apple but is deliberately disconnected from user identities to maintain privacy – into the hands of mobile game developers. This Apple-centric form of attribution will give developers first-hand access to data that was previously the preserve of ad networks and enable them to compare it with what ad networks have been telling them (expect data discrepancies!). When combined with deterministic attribution using data from users that have consented to sharing, and probabilistic attribution, this will make up the bulk of mobile games’ marketing insight. Reconciling this data will be the biggest marketing challenge for mobile games. It will require new tools and training to help smaller studios and publishers collect, verify and analyze their new data, and offset some of the friction of adjusting to an unfamiliar marketing environment. I’m not going to sugarcoat things. The confusion that 99% of mobile game companies are feeling about the privacy-first world and move to Apple-centric (and soon Android-centric) attribution is an opportunity for big mobile gaming players to further entrench their advantages. But with the strategy and tools at their disposal, I’d wager that the creativity, agility and sheer passion of indie and small developers means great IP will always have a chance.

Ayrton Breckenridge University of Iowa business professor Suyong Song poses for a portrait outside the Pappajohn Business Building on Monday, Sept. 13, 2021. Ryan Hansen , News Reporter September 14, 2021 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Print New research conducted by a professor in the University of Iowa Tippie College of Business shows evidence of a beauty premium, where someone who is more physically attractive based on modern beauty standards is paid more. Professor of Economics Suyong Song’s study used data from 20-year-old research conducted by the U.S. Air Force, which included a socioeconomic survey and 3D full-body scans to gather precise measurements from participants. Song said stature, or height, was positively correlated with family income for males. There was a negative correlation between obesity and family income for females, he said. The study maintained factors such as occupation, education level, and location of participants to ensure accurate results. The data indicates a beauty premium, Song said, where someone who is more physically attractive based on modern beauty standards is paid more. When two individuals share the same abilities or level of education, he said the taller male makes an estimated $998 more on average annually than the shorter male. For females, Song said a female with a smaller Body Mass Index would end up with a higher family income compared to a more overweight coworker by more than $930 annually. Both correlations were discovered in families that earn $70,000 per year. Song said these characteristics — height and obesity level — were shared between both male and female data, but female hip-to-waist ratio emerged as a third important feature correlated with family income. The Air Force data was collected during the Air Force’s Civilian American and European Surface Anthropometry Resource project from participants in North America, Italy, and the Netherlands. Song said traditional studies of the beauty premium rely on self-reported measurements, which could create reporting errors. “Instead of relying on surveyed, individual appearances, we can utilize this measured, three-dimensional scan data,” Song said. “We kind of resolve the issue of the reporting error in the existing literature.” Steven Baek, an associate professor of data science at the University of Virginia and founder of the UI Visual Intelligence Laboratory, partnered with Song on the research study. Baek said the research was unique because the 3D scans provided more than 100,000 data points across each participant’s body. To analyze this unique amount of data, Baek and Song used machine-learning technology. “The role of technology was essentially to enable more accurate quantification, more accurate representation of human body shape using the tools of machine-learning,” Baek said. The algorithm, he said, was responsible for creating its own ways of describing the body shapes of the participants, to remove researcher subjectivity from the equation. Song said in more traditional studies of the beauty premium, researchers delivered very subjective evaluations of someone’s beauty based on survey questions about attractive facial or physical beauty. The machine-learning technology helped Song and Baek compress and analyze a massive amount of extremely accurate data, Baek said. Song said he believes more workplace awareness and education about the beauty premium could help to alleviate the correlation between physical attractiveness and family income that the study details. He said interviews conducted over the phone or virtually could help reduce the correlation, but wouldn’t entirely solve the problem. “You can’t tell I’m six feet tall through this virtual interview,” Song said in a phone interview with The Daily Iowan . “[Through] this kind of virtual setting or phone call setting, we can have partially reduced implicit bias in the hiring process. It’s not perfect either, because the hiring process is not the only reason why we have this beauty premium.” Dana Dominguez, the associate director of operations and communication at the UI’s Pomerantz Career Center, wrote they hired a new staff member in August whose role is to work with employers on increasing awareness of disparities such as the beauty premium. She said the center has also been involved in helping their employer partners recognize and learn from statistics and research about these biases. Dominguez wrote in an email to the DI that the center is working to “educate organizations on bias in recruitment, hiring, and other important decisions in the workplace, and ultimately reduce the gaps and disparities that may be present within their own organizations.” Baek said given the complexity of this issue, there is no single solution that exists. The first step is to recognize and understand that there is this income disparity between more physically attractive and less physically attractive individuals, he said. “I don’t believe that my mission is to provide the solutions,” Baek said. “But rather, it’s more on raising the issue and throwing out questions to policy-makers and corporate leadership, so that they can start thinking about what changes to make.” Facebook Comments Campus News Science and Research About the Contributor Ayrton Breckenridge Latest News USG program incentivizes vaccination with raffle prizes Iowa City schools will require masks for K-12 students UI President Barbara Wilson discusses proposed budget requests at Faculty Senate meeting Iowa legislature called for special redistricting session Sanders claim that childhood poverty is cut in half needs a little more time to confirm Navigate Left Campus USG program incentivizes vaccination with raffle prizes Campus UI President Barbara Wilson discusses proposed budget requests at Faculty Senate meeting Campus DI alum Seung Min Kim named UI distinguished recent graduate Campus Tippie professor adapts economic model to understand vaccine hesitancy Campus ZipCar, University of Iowa cancel partnership Campus UI College of Public Health launches new podcast to promote health, safety of farmworkers Campus Student governments ask regents to approve Juneteenth as official holiday Campus How post-9/11 Islamophobia impacted UI students Campus The UI Afro House hosts in-person Black Excellence Week Campus Johnson County Public Health partners with Greek Life to increase vaccination Navigate Right Contact Us Staff Donate Newsletters Print Subscription Reprints and Permissions Publishing Guidelines Editorial Policy RSS Feeds Job Opportunities Apply Job Descriptions FAQ Scholarship Opportunities Advertise Advertising Info / Rate Card Today’s Classified Ads The Daily Iowan archives (1868-present) © 2021 The Daily Iowan.

The original 1960s episodes portrayed a bright, shiny, hi-tech future centered on a white family of four with a robotic maid and a dog named Astro. There were flying cars, jet packs and the amazing video phone. This Jetsonian future conveys a utopian view of the power of technology to improve life and solve society’s problems. At its core is the assumption that technology is always a positive force for good, developed from objective science and engineering and free from human error, biases and prejudices. Although hi-tech innovation affects many aspects of our lives, at the Bander Center for Medical Business Ethics at St. Louis University we focus on technology’s role in human health and the U.S. health care system. Specifically, we are fascinated by how artificial intelligence, or AI, and machine learning are being developed to drive medical decision making. Briefly put, artificial intelligence can process huge amounts of personal information including visual images. AI then learns from that information and, through complex programing or algorithms, quickly identifies, diagnoses and implements decision-making for individual patient care. The expectation is that high-powered technology can bring the right care to the right patient at the right time in a way that is free from human bias and error. That would be a great solution since a substantial body of research shows how bias among health care professionals contributes to poor health outcomes for minority populations. But is the result such a great solution? Unfortunately, emerging research demonstrates the opposite effect. In certain situations, artificial intelligence does not correct for bias. Instead, it reinforces and compounds bias. Yousafzai: Pakistani government backing is what ensured Taliban survival after 9/11 McDermott: Do we really still have to talk about Donald Trump? Yes, we do. Thomadsen: A rumble. A loud roar. And our lives changed forever. Zaman: After 9/11, Afghan hopes soared as U.S. troops came. Those hopes were crushed. Lynn Schmidt: American citizenship means fighting for the common welfare, not just liberty Perhaps the most striking example comes from an October 2019 publication in Science Magazine. This research showed that a widely used algorithm for patients with complex medical conditions withheld necessary care from a substantial percentage of Black patients. That’s because the program focused on costs, not health. Wait, what? Are we saying it costs more to treat Black patients? Actually, here is the point. One main legacy of structural racism is that we have systematically withheld investment from minority communities. As a society, we have underfunded basic infrastructure such as roads and sidewalks. We have failed to guarantee public safety in an effective and respectful way. We have sapped financial resources from minority communities through discriminatory and predatory mortgage and lending practices. We have allocated less money to schools and playgrounds. All these policies and practices take a toll on individual health. Collectively, they have a measurable impact that shows up as an increased burden of chronic disease and a higher likelihood of untimely death. As the Jetson’s dog, Astro, might say, “Ruh-roh!” Although the scope of these issues and their solutions go well beyond the health care system, we as health care professionals are still morally obligated to resist these forces, not augment them. So, what are we to do? At a minimum, we need to maintain a balanced skepticism about the power of hi-tech innovation to cure all ills. As a society and as a research-focused community here in St. Louis, we also need to hold researchers, developers and innovators accountable for testing out the impact of their new hi-tech and artificial-intelligence solutions. Checking for bias should be a core component of technology development prior to rolling out these products. Finally, despite inevitable human flaws and weaknesses, the relationship of one person with another, between health care professional and patient, between human and human, is where the true power for positive change and healthy lives comes from. A future devoid of this human-to-human connection would be a dismal future indeed. Valerie De Wandel is a juris doctor and graduate assistant in health care ethics at St. Louis University.

AI hardware and software: The key to eBay's marketplace At the AI Hardware summit 2021, an eBay exec discusses how its similarity system enables it to build an AI-driven marketplace for better latency and throughput. Share this item with your network: By Esther Ajao, News Writer Published: 14 Sep 2021 The most efficient way to build an AI-driven marketplace is to integrate AI software and AI hardware. That was the message delivered on the first day of the AI Hardware Summit 2021 in a virtual keynote given by Selcuk Kopru, eBay's head of machine learning (ML) and natural language processing. For a giant vendor like eBay with 159 million active buyers and 19 million active sellers, AI is depended upon to give both buyers and sellers a seamless e-commerce experience. According to Kopru, to build a global marketplace driven by modern, powerful and scalable AI services, enterprises must optimize systems after training models specifically for their AI hardware. ""Especially for online use cases, we need to be extra careful in building efficient and lightweight models that are optimized for the right infrastructure ,"" Kopru said. A similarity system The marketplace vendor uses a similarity system to integrate AI hardware, including GPU and CPU chips, with its machine learning and other AI algorithms. The reason for building a similarity system is to achieve scalability and performance. Similarity is the relationship between entities based on their search rankings and other variables. For the consumer, the similarity can be between a text query and a title. For the seller, it can be between an image and a title. The similarity system improves the listing appearance for sellers because it helps eBay suggest accurate titles to sellers based on the image they have uploaded to the platform. Here, eBay shows how its similarity model helps it solves AI problems in the marketplace. The first step in building a similarity system is to learn the representations or the embeddings using large transformer models, or a type of deep learning system. After that, eBay builds a kNN ( k-nearest neighbors ) index -- a type of similarity system that is used offline during index building. In the online retrieval stage, the query goes through the learning model and vector embedding is computed. The vector is the input into the kNN index. From there, the kNN search is retrieved from the index. Using the similarity system helps accelerate latency and throughput performance. Representation learning EBay starts the representation learning process with the E-BERT ML model , using a large amount of data. To train the transformer model, eBay uses GPUs. EBay also uses AI chips for inferencing. Kopru said one way of controlling the cost of training the transformer model is to ensure applied researchers across the company have access to all pretrained models. ""Every applied researcher, every engineer can access and start fine-tuning the pretrained models with only a few lines of Python code,"" Kopru said. For quick online transactions, eBay uses a teacher-student ML model, which enables it to build much smaller models with some accuracy tradeoff. ""This tradeoff is a good one, based on the result we're getting,"" Kopru said.

CREATE AN ACCOUNT SIGN IN Robotics Type Guest Article Topic Rule of the Robots: Warning Signs In an excerpt from his new book, Martin Ford discusses the potential for an AI winter Martin Ford 11h 6 min read Basic Books book excerpt martin ford robots ai ai winter A few years ago, Martin Ford published a book called Architects of Intelligence , in which he interviewed 23 of the most experienced AI and robotics researchers in the world . Those interviews are just as fascinating to read now as they were in 2018, but Ford's since had some extra time to chew on them, in the context of a several years of somewhat disconcertingly rapid AI progress (and hype), coupled with the economic upheaval caused by the pandemic. In his new book, Rule of the Robots: How Artificial Intelligence Will Transform Everything , Ford takes a markedly well-informed but still generally optimistic look at where AI is taking us as a society. It's not all good, and there are still a lot of unknowns, but Ford has a perspective that's both balanced and nuanced, and I can promise you that the book is well worth a read. The following excerpt is a section entitled ""Warning Signs,"" from the chapter ""Deep Learning and the Future of Artificial Intelligence."" —Evan Ackerman The 2010s were arguably the most exciting and consequential decade in the history of artificial intelligence. Though there have certainly been conceptual improvements in the algorithms used in AI, the primary driver of all this progress has simply been deploying more expansive deep neural networks on ever faster computer hardware where they can hoover up greater and greater quantities of training data. This ""scaling"" strategy has been explicit since the 2012 ImageNet competition that set off the deep learning revolution. In November of that year, a front-page New York Times article was instrumental in bringing awareness of deep learning technology to the broader public sphere. The article, written by reporter John Markoff, ends with a quote from Geoff Hinton: ""The point about this approach is that it scales beautifully. Basically you just need to keep making it bigger and faster, and it will get better. There's no looking back now."" There is increasing evidence, however, that this primary engine of progress is beginning to sputter out. According to one analysis by the research organization OpenAI, the computational resources required for cutting-edge AI projects is ""increasing exponentially"" and doubling about every 3.4 months. In a December 2019 Wired magazine interview, Jerome Pesenti, Facebook's Vice President of AI, suggested that even for a company with pockets as deep as Facebook's, this would be financially unsustainable: When you scale deep learning, it tends to behave better and to be able to solve a broader task in a better way. So, there's an advantage to scaling. But clearly the rate of progress is not sustainable. If you look at top experiments, each year the cost [is] going up 10-fold. Right now, an experiment might be in seven figures, but it's not going to go to nine or ten figures, it's not possible, nobody can afford that. Pesenti goes on to offer a stark warning about the potential for scaling to continue to be the primary driver of progress: ""At some point we're going to hit the wall. In many ways we already have."" Beyond the financial limits of scaling to ever larger neural networks, there are also important environmental considerations. A 2019 analysis by researchers at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, found that training a very large deep learning system could potentially emit as much carbon dioxide as five cars over their full operational lifetimes. Even if the financial and environmental impact challenges can be overcome—perhaps through the development of vastly more efficient hardware or software—scaling as a strategy simply may not be sufficient to produce sustained progress. Ever-increasing investments in computation have produced systems with extraordinary proficiency in narrow domains, but it is becoming increasingly clear that deep neural networks are subject to reliability limitations that may make the technology unsuitable for many mission critical applications unless important conceptual breakthroughs are made. One of the most notable demonstrations of the technology's weaknesses came when a group of researchers at Vicarious, small company focused on building dexterous robots, performed an analysis of the neural network used in Deep-Mind's DQN, the system that had learned to dominate Atari video games. One test was performed on Breakout , a game in which the player has to manipulate a paddle to intercept a fast-moving ball. When the paddle was shifted just a few pixels higher on the screen—a change that might not even be noticed by a human player—the system's previously superhuman performance immediately took a nose dive. DeepMind's software had no ability to adapt to even this small alteration. The only way to get back to top-level performance would have been to start from scratch and completely retrain the system with data based on the new screen configuration. What this tells us is that while DeepMind's powerful neural networks do instantiate a representation of the Breakout screen, this representation remains firmly anchored to raw pixels even at the higher levels of abstraction deep in the network. There is clearly no emergent understanding of the paddle as an actual object that can be moved. In other words, there is nothing close to a human-like comprehension of the material objects that the pixels on the screen represent or the physics that govern their movement. It's just pixels all the way down. While some AI researchers may continue to believe that a more comprehensive understanding might eventually emerge if only there were more layers of artificial neurons, running on faster hardware and consuming still more data, I think this is very unlikely. More fundamental innovations will be required before we begin to see machines with a more human-like conception of the world. This general type of problem, in which an AI system is inflexible and unable to adapt to even small unexpected changes in its input data, is referred to, among researchers, as ""brittleness."" A brittle AI application may not be a huge problem if it results in a warehouse robot occasionally packing the wrong item into a box. In other applications, however, the same technical shortfall can be catastrophic. This explains, for example, why progress toward fully autonomous self-driving cars has not lived up to some of the more exuberant early predictions. As these limitations came into focus toward the end of the decade, there was a gnawing fear that the field had once again gotten over its skis and that the hype cycle had driven expectations to unrealistic levels. In the tech media and on social media, one of the most terrifying phrases in the field of artificial intelligence—"" AI winter ""—was making a reappearance. In a January 2020 interview with the BBC, Yoshua Bengio said that ""AI's abilities were somewhat overhyped . . . by certain companies with an interest in doing so."" My own view is that if another AI winter indeed looms, it's likely to be a mild one. Though the concerns about slowing progress are well founded, it remains true that over the past few years AI has been deeply integrated into the infrastructure and business models of the largest technology companies. These companies have seen significant returns on their massive investments in computing resources and AI talent, and they now view artificial intelligence as absolutely critical to their ability to compete in the marketplace. Likewise, nearly every technology startup is now, to some degree, investing in AI, and companies large and small in other industries are beginning to deploy the technology. This successful integration into the commercial sphere is vastly more significant than anything that existed in prior AI winters, and as a result the field benefits from an army of advocates throughout the corporate world and has a general momentum that will act to moderate any downturn. There's also a sense in which the fall of scalability as the primary driver of progress may have a bright side. When there is a widespread belief that simply throwing more computing resources at a problem will produce important advances, there is significantly less incentive to invest in the much more difficult work of true innovation. This was arguably the case, for example, with Moore's Law. When there was near absolute confidence that computer speeds would double roughly every two years, the semiconductor industry tended to focus on cranking out ever faster versions of the same microprocessor designs from companies like Intel and Motorola. In recent years, the acceleration in raw computer speeds has become less reliable, and our traditional definition of Moore's Law is approaching its end game as the dimensions of the circuits imprinted on chips shrink to nearly atomic size. This has forced engineers to engage in more ""out of the box"" thinking, resulting in innovations such as software designed for massively parallel computing and entirely new chip architectures—many of which are optimized for the complex calculations required by deep neural networks. I think we can expect the same sort of idea explosion to happen in deep learning, and artificial intelligence more broadly, as the crutch of simply scaling to larger neural networks becomes a less viable path to progress.

Combine harvesters that can drive themselves using technology from Russian company Cognitive Pilot are helping to make the harvesting process faster and more efficient. Cognitive Pilot Blue The field of automated precision agriculture is based on one concept—autonomous driving technologies that guide vehicles through GPS navigation. Fifteen years ago, when high-accuracy GPS became available for civilian use, farmers thought things would be simple: Put a GPS receiver station at the edge of the field, configure a route for a tractor or a combine harvester, and off you go, dear robot! Practice has shown, however, that this kind of carefree field cultivation is inefficient and dangerous. It works only in ideal fields, which are almost never encountered in real life. If there's a log or a rock in the field, or a couple of village paramours dozing in the rye under the sun, the tractor will run right over them. And not all countries have reliable satellite coverage—in agricultural markets like Kazakhstan, coverage can be unstable. This is why, if you want safe and efficient farming, you need to equip your vehicle with sensors and an artificial intelligence that can see and understand its surroundings instead of blindly following GPS navigation instructions. The Cognitive Agro Pilot system lets a human operator focus on harvesting rather than driving. An integrated display and control system in the cab handles driving based on a video feed from a single low-resolution camera, no GPS or Internet connectivity required. Cognitive Pilot You might think that GPS navigation is ideal for automated agriculture, since the task facing the operator of a farm vehicle like a combine harvester is simply to drive around the field in a serpentine pattern, mowing down all the wheat or whatever crop it is filled with. But reality is far different. There are hundreds of things operators must watch even as they keep their eyes fastened to the edge of the field to ensure that they move alongside it with fine precision. An agricultural combine is not dissimilar to a church organ in terms of its operational complexity. When a combine operator works with an assistant, one of them steers along the crop edge, while the other controls the reel, the fan, the threshing drum, and the harvesting process in general. In Soviet times, there were two operators in a combine crew, but now there is only one. This means choosing between safe driving and efficient harvesting. And since you can't harvest grain without moving, driving becomes the top priority, and the efficiency of the harvesting process tends to suffer. Harvesting efficiency is especially important in Eastern Europe, where farming is high risk and there is only one harvest a year. The season starts in March and farmers don't rest until the autumn, when they have only two weeks to harvest the crops. If something goes wrong, every day they miss may lead to a loss of 10 percent of the yield. If a driver does a poor job of harvesting or gets drunk and crashes the machine, precious time is lost—hours or even days. About 90 percent of the combine operator's time is spent making sure that the combine is driving exactly along the edge of the unharvested crop to maximize efficiency without missing any of the crop. But this is the most unpleasant part of the driving, and due to fatigue at the end of the shift, operators typically leave nearly a meter at the edge of each row uncut. These steering errors account for a 25 percent overall increase in harvesting time. Our technology allows combine operators to delegate the driving so that they can instead focus on optimizing harvesting quality. Add to this the fact that the skilled combine operator is a dying breed. Professional education has declined, and the young people joining the labor force aren't up to the same standard. Though the same can be said of most manual trades, this effect creates a great demand for our robotic system, the Cognitive Agro Pilot. Developing AI systems is in my genome. My father, Anatoly Uskov, was on the first team of AI program developers at the System Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences . Their program, named Kaissa , became the world computer chess champion in 1974. Two decades later, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Systems Research Institute's AI laboratories formed the foundation of my company, Cognitive Technologies . Our first business was developing optical character recognition software used by companies including HP, Oracle, and Samsung, and our success allowed us to support an R&D team of mathematicians and programmers conducting fundamental research in the field of computer vision and adjacent areas. In 2012, we added a group of mathematicians developing neural networks. Later that year, this group proudly introduced me to their creation: Vasya, a football-playing toy car with a camera for an eye. ""One-eyed Vasya"" could recognize a ball among other objects in our long office hallway, and push it around. The robot was a massive distraction for everyone working on that floor, as employees went out into the hallway and started ""testing"" the car by tripping it up and blocking its way to the ball with obstacles. Meanwhile, the algorithm showed stable performance. Politely swerving around obstacles, the car kept on looking for the ball and pushing it. It almost gave an impression of a living creature, and this was our ""eureka"" moment—why don't we try doing the same with something larger and more useful?

Cognitive Pilot After initially experimenting with large heavy-duty trucks, we realized that the agricultural sector doesn't have the major legal and regulatory constraints that road transport has in Russia and elsewhere. Since our priority was to develop a commercially viable product, we set up a business unit called Cognitive Pilot that develops add-on autonomy for combine harvesters, which are the machines used to harvest the vast majority of grain crops (including corn, wheat, barley, oats, and rye) on large farms. Just five years ago, it was impossible to use video-content analysis to operate agricultural machinery at this level of automation because there weren't any fully functional neural networks that could detect the borders of a crop strip or see any obstacles in it. At first, we considered combining GPS with visual data analysis, but it didn't take us long to realize that visual analytics alone is enough. For a GPS steering system to work, you need to prepare a map in advance, install a base station for corrections, or purchase a package of signals. It also requires pressing a lot of buttons in a lot of menus, and combine operators have very little appreciation for user interfaces. What we offer is a camera and a box stuffed with processing power and neural networks. As soon as the camera and the box are mounted and connected to the combine's control system, we're good to go. Once in the field, the newly installed Cognitive Agro Pilot says: ""Hurray, we're in the field,"" asks the driver for permission to take over, and starts driving. Five years from now, we predict that all combine harvesters will be equipped with a computer vision–based autopilot capable of controlling every aspect of harvesting crops. From a single video stream, Cognitive Agro Pilot's neural networks are able to identify crops, cleared ground, static obstacles, and moving obstacles like people or other vehicles. Cognitive Pilot Getting to this point has meant solving some fascinating challenges. We realized we would be facing an immense diversity of field scenes that our neural network must be trained to understand. Already working with farmers on the early project stages, we found out that the same crops can look completely different in different climatic zones. Preparing for mass production of our system, we tried to compile the most highly diversified data set with various fields and crops, starting with videos filmed in the fields of several farms across Russia under different weather and lighting conditions. But it soon became evident we needed to come up with a more adaptable solution. We decided to use a coarse-to-fine approach to train our networks for autonomous driving. The initial version is improved with each new client, as we obtain additional data on different locations and crops. We use this data to make our networks more accurate and reliable, employing unsupervised domain adaptation to recalibrate them in a short time by adding carefully randomized noise and distortions to the training images to make the networks more robust. Humans are still needed to help with semantic segmentation on new varieties of crops. Thanks to this approach, we have now obtained highly resilient all-purpose networks suitable for use on over a dozen different crops grown across Eastern Europe. The way the Cognitive Agro Pilot drives a combine is similar to how a human driver does it. That is, our unique competitive edge is the system's ability to see and understand the situation in the field much as a human would, so it maintains full efficiency in collaboration with human drivers. At the end of the day, it all comes down to economics. One human-driven combine can harvest around 20 hectares of crops during one shift. When Cognitive Agro Pilot does the driving, the operators' workload is considerably lower: They don't get tired, can make fewer stops, and take fewer breaks. In practical terms, it means harvesting around 25 to 30 hectares per shift. For a business owner, it means that two combines equipped with our system deliver the performance of three combines without it. Your browser does not support the video tag. While the combine drives itself, the human operator can make adjustments to the harvesting system to maximize speed and efficiency. Cognitive Pilot On the market now there are some separate developments from various agricultural-harvesting companies. But each of their autonomous features is done as a separate function—driving along a field edge, driving along a row, and so on. We haven't yet seen another industrial system that can drive completely with computer vision, but one-eyed Vasya showed us that this was possible. And so as we thought about cost optimization and solving the task with a minimum set of devices, we decided that for a farmer's AI-based robot assistant, one camera is enough. The Cognitive Agro Pilot's primary sensor is a single 2-megapixel color video camera that can see a wide area in front of the vehicle, mounted on a bracket near one of the combine's side mirrors. A control unit with an Nvidia Jetson TX2 computer module is mounted inside the cab, with an integrated display and driver interface. This control unit contains the main stack of autonomy algorithms, processes the video feed, and issues commands to the combine's hydraulic systems for control of steering, acceleration, and braking. A display in the cab provides the interface for the driver and displays warnings and settings. We are not tied to any particular brand; our retrofit kit will work with any combine harvester model available in the farmer's fleet. For a combine more than five years old, interfacing with its control system may not be quite so easy (sometimes an additional steering-angle sensor is required), but the installation and calibration can still usually be done within one day, and it takes just 10 minutes to train a new driver. Our vision-based system drives the combine, so the operator can focus on the harvest and adjusting the process to the specific features of the crop. The Cognitive Agro Pilot does all of the steering and maintains a precise distance between rows, minimizing gaps. It looks for obstacles, categorizes them, and forecasts their trajectory if they're moving. If there is time, it warns the driver to avoid the obstacles, or it decides to drive around them or slow down. It also coordinates its movement with a grain truck and with other combines when it is part of a formation. The only time that the operator is routinely required to drive is to turn the combine around at the end of a run. If you need to turn, go ahead—the Cognitive Agro Pilot releases the controls and starts looking for a new crop edge. As soon as it finds one, the robot says: ""Let me do the driving, man."" You push the button, and it takes over. Everything is simple and intuitive. And since a run is normally up to 5 kilometers long, these turns account for less than 1 percent of a driver's workload. Once in the field, the newly installed Cognitive Agro Pilot says: ""Hurray, we're in the field,"" asks the driver for permission to take over, and starts driving. During our pilot project last year, the yield from the same fields increased by 3 to 5 percent due to the ability of the harvester to maintain the cut width without leaving unharvested areas. It increased an additional 3 percent simply because the operators had time to more closely monitor what was going on in front of them, optimizing the harvesting performance. With our copilot, drivers' workloads are very low. They start the system, let go of the steering wheel, and can concentrate on controlling the machinery or checking commodity prices on their phones. Harvesting weeks are a real ordeal for combine drivers, who get no rest except for some sleep at night. In one month they need to earn enough for the upcoming six, so they are exhausted. However, the drivers who were using our solution realized they even had some energy left, and those who chose to work long hours said they could easily work 2 hours more than usual. Gaining 10 or 15 percent more working hours over the course of the harvest may sound negligible, but it means that a driver has three extra days to harvest the crops. Consequently, if there are days of bad weather (like rain that causes the grain to germinate or fall down), the probability of keeping the crop yield high is a lot greater. And since combine operators get paid by harvested volume, using our system helps them make more money. Ultimately, both drivers and managers say unanimously that harvesting has become easier, and typically the cost of the system (about US $10,000) is paid off in just one season. Combine drivers quickly get the hang of our technology—after the first few days, many drivers either start to trust in our robot as an almighty intelligence, or decide to test it to death. Some get the misconception that our robots think like humans and are a little disappointed to see that our system underperforms at night and has trouble driving in dust when multiple combines are driving in file. Even though humans can have problems in these situations also, operators would grumble: ""How can it not see?"" A human driver understands that the distance to the combine ahead is about 10 meters and that they are traveling at a constant speed. The dust cloud will blow away in a minute, and everything will be fine. No need to brake. Alex, the driver of the combine ahead, definitely won't brake. Or will he? Since the system hasn't spent years alongside Alex and cannot use life experience to predict his actions, it stops the combine and releases the controls. This is where human intelligence once again wins out over AI. Turns at the end of each run are also left to human intelligence, for now. This feature never failed to amaze combine drivers but turned out to be the most challenging during tests: The immense width of the header means that a huge number of hypotheses about objects beyond the line of sight of our single camera need to be factored in. To automate this feature, we're waiting for the completion of tests on rugged terrain. We are also experimenting with our own synthetic-aperture radar technology, which can see crop edges and crop rows as radio-frequency images. This does not add much to the total solution cost, and we plan to use radar for advanced versions of our ""agrodroids"" intended for work in low visibility and at night. Robot in Disguise It takes just four parts to transform almost any human-driven combine harvester into a robot. A camera [1] mounted on a side-view mirror watches the field ahead, sending a video stream to a combined computing unit, display, and driver interface [2] in the driver's cab. A neural network analyzes the video to find crop edges and obstacles, and sends commands to the hydraulic unit [3] to control the combine. For older combines, a steering sensor [4] mounted inside a wheel provides directional feedback for precision driving. While Cognitive Pilot's system takes care of the driving, it's the job of the human operator in the cab to optimize the performance of the header [5] to harvest the crop efficiently. Cognitive Pilot During the summer and autumn of 2020, more than 350 autonomous combines equipped with the Cognitive Agro Pilot system drove across over 160,000 hectares of fields and helped their human supervisors harvest more than 720,000 tonnes of crops from Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea to Vladivostok in the Russian Far East. Our robots have worked more than 230,000 hours, passing 950,000 autonomous kilometers driven last year. And by the end of 2021, our system will be available in the United States and South America. Common farmers and the end users of our solutions may have heard about driverless cars in the news or seen the words ""neural network"" a couple of times, but that about sums up their AI experience. So it is fascinating to hear them say things like ""Look how well the segmentation has worked!"" or ""The neural network is doing great!"" in the driver's cab. Changing the technological paradigm takes time, so we ensure the widest possible compatibility of our solutions with existing machinery. Undoubtedly, as farmers adapt to the current innovations, we will continuously increase the autonomy of all types of machinery for all kinds of tasks. A few years ago, I studied the work of the United Nations mission in Rwanda dealing with the issues of chronic child malnutrition. I will never forget the photographs of emaciated children.

You know that you need to use the same tools, if not better ones. AI security is about having the right tools, but also about having the right information. But you aren’t sure where to start your AI security journey, and you aren’t alone. Many business or agency leaders are in the exact same place and have the same questions. I’ve talked with many companies that are in various stages of the AI journey. And I’ve seen firsthand that, for many, deep learning is a good first step toward using AI-based security. Is Deep Learning for Security the Same as AI Security? Yes and no; deep learning is a type of machine learning. And yes, machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence . The goal of AI, whether that’s AI security or otherwise, is to mimic the human brain. When you read or watch information on a topic, you learn more about that subject. Then, you can better make logic-based decisions and predictions. As a human, there is a limit to the amount, speed and complexity of the information you take in. But AI engines can process much higher volumes, at faster speeds. AI trains itself by consuming data from both structured and unstructured sources and then uses reason to make suggestions. And as quantum computing becomes more common in the coming years, AI will become even more powerful. How Is Deep Learning Different From Machine Learning? They are similar, but each type of AI is better suited for different tasks. So, they use different techniques for almost the same purpose. With classical machine learning , the AI algorithm must pre-process unstructured data to organize it into a structured format before using it. Deep learning processes unstructured data (e.g., text and images) just as it is. This makes its processing of unstructured data faster and more accurate. Deep learning uses two unique methods to learn and reason: propagation and backpropagation. During the former, the deep learning algorithm moves through layers that build on each other. Because of this, the way it processes and predicts data is more accurate. Backpropagation relies on the algorithm to look for errors in predictions. Next, it uses that information to train the model more accurately. Why Is Deep Learning a Good Option for Cybersecurity? When using AI for cybersecurity, you must first train the model on the right topics and methods. Many of the sources needed in this field (such as message boards) are unstructured. So, deep learning allows you to collect more information on potential threats, which can then be used to predict potential risk. Without this unstructured data, AI algorithms are likely to be less accurate. The next step is using what you’ve collected and the insights AI provides to spot potential threats, such as malicious files, suspicious IP addresses or employees performing actions that are potential insider attacks. However, AI cybersecurity is only effective if it predicts the threats right. While overlooking potential threats can be harmful, false positives force people to waste time that could be spent preventing actual threats. Propagation and backpropagation increase the AI’s accuracy  — and keep your data better protected. How Do I Start Using Deep Learning for AI Security? Your first step toward using AI security is to select a tool that uses AI to analyze and predict threats. When researching different tools, look for one that uses deep learning as its cornerstone. This will ensure it’s accurate and will help your team spend their energy on the highest risk threats. By using deep learning, you can decrease both your risk and the time spent on detecting threats, which allows your team to focus on work that needs the human touch.

And a new tool can help ensure there are minimal gaps in communicating such information. University of Tokyo researchers evaluated four methods for discerning radiology reports flagged as “actionable” in clinical practice from “non-actionable” ones. A publicly available tool beat out other machine learning models at the task, experts reported Sept. 11 in BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making . This natural language processing technique can help clinicians spot mentions of actionable findings that may have gone overlooked and avoid costly delays to patient care, according to Yuta Nakamura, with The University of Tokyo Hospital’s Department of Radiology, and co-authors. “The results of this study suggest that the radiologists may have sometimes thought that actionable findings were present in the radiological images without explicitly urging further clinical examinations or treatments in the radiology report,” Nakamura et al. wrote, adding their method can key in on these cases and bring them to the physicians’ attention. Back in September 2019, the hospital embedded a function in its system allowing clinicians to label radiology reports with an actionable tag. For their study, Nakamura et al. sought to determine which models could best distinguish such actionable reports from non-actionable documents. They included more than 90,000 rad reports from their institution, and 788 (0.87%) were labeled as actionable. A new natural language processing tool, known as bidirectional encoder representations from transformers or BERT, beat out all others. Without order information—such as “suspected diseases or indications”—BERT notched the highest area under the precision-recall curve (0.51) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.95). Adding order info, however, did not lead to meaningful change. BERT may have been most effective, the team noted, because implicit reports often emphasized actionable abnormalities, and the system’s classifiers also spotted recommendations for follow-up care explicitly highlighted in rad reports. Larger data pools from multiple organizations will be needed to refine the technique, according to the authors, but the early returns are promising. “The results showed that our method based on BERT is more useful for distinguishing various actionable radiology reports from non-actionable ones than models based on other deep learning methods or statistical machine learning,” the group concluded.

Ayrton Breckenridge University of Iowa business professor Suyong Song poses for a portrait outside the Pappajohn Business Building on Monday, Sept. 13, 2021. Ryan Hansen , News Reporter September 14, 2021 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Print New research conducted by a professor in the University of Iowa Tippie College of Business shows evidence of a beauty premium, where someone who is more physically attractive based on modern beauty standards is paid more. Professor of Economics Suyong Song’s study used data from 20-year-old research conducted by the U.S. Air Force, which included a socioeconomic survey and 3D full-body scans to gather precise measurements from participants. Song said stature, or height, was positively correlated with family income for males. There was a negative correlation between obesity and family income for females, he said. The study maintained factors such as occupation, education level, and location of participants to ensure accurate results. The data indicates a beauty premium, Song said, where someone who is more physically attractive based on modern beauty standards is paid more. When two individuals share the same abilities or level of education, he said the taller male makes an estimated $998 more on average annually than the shorter male. For females, Song said a female with a smaller Body Mass Index would end up with a higher family income compared to a more overweight coworker by more than $930 annually. Both correlations were discovered in families that earn $70,000 per year. Song said these characteristics — height and obesity level — were shared between both male and female data, but female hip-to-waist ratio emerged as a third important feature correlated with family income. The Air Force data was collected during the Air Force’s Civilian American and European Surface Anthropometry Resource project from participants in North America, Italy, and the Netherlands. Song said traditional studies of the beauty premium rely on self-reported measurements, which could create reporting errors. “Instead of relying on surveyed, individual appearances, we can utilize this measured, three-dimensional scan data,” Song said. “We kind of resolve the issue of the reporting error in the existing literature.” Steven Baek, an associate professor of data science at the University of Virginia and founder of the UI Visual Intelligence Laboratory, partnered with Song on the research study. Baek said the research was unique because the 3D scans provided more than 100,000 data points across each participant’s body. To analyze this unique amount of data, Baek and Song used machine-learning technology. “The role of technology was essentially to enable more accurate quantification, more accurate representation of human body shape using the tools of machine-learning,” Baek said. The algorithm, he said, was responsible for creating its own ways of describing the body shapes of the participants, to remove researcher subjectivity from the equation. Song said in more traditional studies of the beauty premium, researchers delivered very subjective evaluations of someone’s beauty based on survey questions about attractive facial or physical beauty. The machine-learning technology helped Song and Baek compress and analyze a massive amount of extremely accurate data, Baek said. Song said he believes more workplace awareness and education about the beauty premium could help to alleviate the correlation between physical attractiveness and family income that the study details. He said interviews conducted over the phone or virtually could help reduce the correlation, but wouldn’t entirely solve the problem. “You can’t tell I’m six feet tall through this virtual interview,” Song said in a phone interview with The Daily Iowan . “[Through] this kind of virtual setting or phone call setting, we can have partially reduced implicit bias in the hiring process. It’s not perfect either, because the hiring process is not the only reason why we have this beauty premium.” Dana Dominguez, the associate director of operations and communication at the UI’s Pomerantz Career Center, wrote they hired a new staff member in August whose role is to work with employers on increasing awareness of disparities such as the beauty premium. She said the center has also been involved in helping their employer partners recognize and learn from statistics and research about these biases. Dominguez wrote in an email to the DI that the center is working to “educate organizations on bias in recruitment, hiring, and other important decisions in the workplace, and ultimately reduce the gaps and disparities that may be present within their own organizations.” Baek said given the complexity of this issue, there is no single solution that exists. The first step is to recognize and understand that there is this income disparity between more physically attractive and less physically attractive individuals, he said. “I don’t believe that my mission is to provide the solutions,” Baek said. “But rather, it’s more on raising the issue and throwing out questions to policy-makers and corporate leadership, so that they can start thinking about what changes to make.” Facebook Comments Campus News Science and Research About the Contributor Ayrton Breckenridge Latest News USG program incentivizes vaccination with raffle prizes Iowa City schools will require masks for K-12 students UI President Barbara Wilson discusses proposed budget requests at Faculty Senate meeting Iowa legislature called for special redistricting session Sanders claim that childhood poverty is cut in half needs a little more time to confirm Navigate Left Campus USG program incentivizes vaccination with raffle prizes Campus UI President Barbara Wilson discusses proposed budget requests at Faculty Senate meeting Campus DI alum Seung Min Kim named UI distinguished recent graduate Campus Tippie professor adapts economic model to understand vaccine hesitancy Campus ZipCar, University of Iowa cancel partnership Campus UI College of Public Health launches new podcast to promote health, safety of farmworkers Campus Student governments ask regents to approve Juneteenth as official holiday Campus How post-9/11 Islamophobia impacted UI students Campus The UI Afro House hosts in-person Black Excellence Week Campus Johnson County Public Health partners with Greek Life to increase vaccination Navigate Right Contact Us Staff Donate Newsletters Print Subscription Reprints and Permissions Publishing Guidelines Editorial Policy RSS Feeds Job Opportunities Apply Job Descriptions FAQ Scholarship Opportunities Advertise Advertising Info / Rate Card Today’s Classified Ads The Daily Iowan archives (1868-present) © 2021 The Daily Iowan.

The startup says that the platform, AI Cloud, can function as the central hub for a company’s AI initiatives. It provides features for all the key coding and software deployment tasks involved in building machine learning applications. Organizations can run AI Cloud in all the major public clouds and their on-premises data centers. The launch is DataRobot’s broadest product update since its most recent $300 million funding round earlier this year. The round , which was led by Altimeter Capital and Tiger Global, gave the startup a valuation of $6.3 billion. “AI will reshape every industry, every business service, every customer interaction,” stated DataRobot Chief Executive Officer Dan Wright. “DataRobot AI Cloud captures insights and learnings from years of technological innovation and partnering closely with our customers.” DataRobot targets both data scientists and business users as part of its go-to-market strategy. For business users, DataRobot provides a point-and-click AI builder that makes it possible to create a machine learning model without any coding. The tool evaluates the task that the user wishes to automate using AI, then automatically finds a suitable neural network from a library of pre-packaged algorithms provided by DataRobot. The selected neural network is sequentially trained on a similarly automated basis. AI Cloud introduces a feature called Composable ML that, according to DataRobot, will make its no-code AI builder useful not only for business users but also data scientists. Often, data scientists prefer coding their own custom neural networks instead of using an algorithm supplied by a development automation tool. Composable ML allows them to blend the two approaches. Data scientists can generate a neural network using DataRobot’s no-code AI builder and customize it to their requirements with custom code, an approach that DataRobot promises is faster than building everything from scratch. The startup says it’s addressing a major challenge in enterprise AI initiatives. According to research from DataRobot’s Algorithmia unit, 87% of companies cite long deployment times as a challenge in machine learning projects. Speeding the process by reducing manual work for data scientists can in theory help enterprises realize a return on their machine learning investments faster. The AI Cloud platform is aimed at “enabling users of all skill sets to deliver more models, faster,” Wright said. A particularly time-consuming aspect of AI development is data preparation. Before a company can send a set of business records to a machine learning model for analysis, it has to import the records from the system where they’re stored, filter any errors they contain and, in some cases, modify the way the information is structured. DataRobot is releasing a feature called DataRobot Pipelines as part of Cloud AI that allows customers to create software workflows for automating the process. Another set of new features is aimed at making the management of AI models easier once development is complete and they’re running in production. A capability called Bias Monitoring helps data scientists detect when bias occurs in an AI model. Another new addition,  Continuous AI, enables companies to automatically retrain their machine learning applications on a new dataset. AI models are often used for the same types of business tasks across different companies. For example, two competing retailers might both have a machine learning application that predicts when product shipments from suppliers will arrive. DataRobot is rolling out templates for common machine learning use cases to reduce the amount of work involved in building AI applications. The templates, which DataRobot calls Pathfinder Solution Accelerators, are aimed at further reducing the amount of time required to complete AI projects in the enterprise.

Seeking.com now utilizes a humans-in-the-loop (HITL) system, which includes both human review and AI, for keyword detection, image moderation and measures to eliminate potential fraudulent behaviors such as nudity, violence, and scam behavior.  Learning from the likes of Facebook, Seeking.com avoids the disastrous image mislabeling with a far more sophisticated approach to image moderation. The systems in place use HITL along with superior image labeling measures to make sure racial bias is dramatically reduced compared to other platforms who handle user-generated content.  “My team and I have spent countless hours working hard to build our AI and ML system to balance quality, user privacy and ethical behavior when systems are automated,” notes Justyn Hornor, Vice President of Product for Seeking.com . “We are years ahead of the competition and teach some of the largest AI firms in the world how to operationalize AI in the context of user-generated content.” Priding itself on being ahead of the European Union’s regulations for AI, Seeking.com is already building its AI monitoring system to continually re-train itself—guaranteeing it remains best-in-class while scanning for fraudulent behavior.  “The EU is leading the way with their ethical guidelines on how AI systems should operate, and we’re fully in support of their directions, encouraging the U.S. regulatory approaches to mirror the EU model,” says Hornor. “We started this journey with ethics and transparency at the forefront, and built our technology around those frameworks, with many of these ideas already baked into our AI-based systems for well over a year now.” Seeking.com began rolling out AI-based content moderation in June of 2020, already capturing the attention of several Fortune 10 companies who have requested assistance from the team to learn how to improve their own AI systems.  In addition to the AI solutions, Seeking.com will continue its security rollout to include even more safety features, including more advanced ID verification, later this year. Other security measures are being actively released that will continue to make sure that Seeking.com is the safest, most secure dating platform on the planet.    For more information regarding Seeking.com ’s safety measures, please contact press@seeking.com . ### About Seeking.com With over 20 million members worldwide, Seeking.com creates a community where singles are empowered to find relationships on their terms, encouraging upfront and honest communication for an elevated dating experience.

Sep 14, 2021 UCLA Samueli Newsroom Suhas Diggavi, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at the UCLA Samueli School of Engineering, has received a 2021 Facebook Statistics for Improving Insights, Models and Decisions award for his research on privacy in machine learning and analytics. Facebook announced the research program in April at The Web Conference. UCLA is the only University of California campus selected among the 10 winners and 15 finalists out of 134 total proposals from across the globe. Diggavi received a $50,000 award to support his research on a machine learning technique, known as federated learning, which trains an algorithm across distributed edge devices housing local data that could be sensitive and need to be kept private. Specifically, Diggavi’s winning research looks at privacy in personalized learning models. Most personalized technologies require multiple devices to analyze large amounts of data, which can jeopardize individuals’ privacy in the process. Diggavi hopes to find a way to ensure robust protection of sensitive data while also advancing individualized models. This award will help support a larger program in his lab focused on private, secure and efficient distributed learning. Diggavi leads the Information Theory and Systems Laboratory at UCLA, where his research focuses on how information theory can be used across a multitude of fields, including learning, security, privacy, cyber-physical systems, wireless networks, bioinformatics and neuroscience. Earlier this year, Diggavi was one of two UCLA Samueli professors to receive the 2020 Amazon Research Award . He was also awarded the 2021 Guggenheim Fellowship and the 2019 Google Faculty Research Award . Sara Hubbard contributed to this story.

Samuel Jonathan GUNTUR, September 15, 2021 01:14 IST Updated: September 15, 2021 01:14 IST Virtual cloud technology will ensure seamless connectivity and data storage, says SRM Pro V-C Share Article PRINT A A A Virtual cloud technology will ensure seamless connectivity and data storage, says SRM Pro V-C Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) will change the way we live, and virtual cloud-enabled seamless data connectivity would usher in a digital revolution by 2040, said D. Narayana Rao, Pro-Vice Chancellor of SRM University. A senior scientist in the field of Atmospheric Science Research and Radar Technology and former Director, National Atmospheric Research Laboratory, Dr. Narayana Rao said that just as the world has seen revolutionary changes between 2000 and 2020, current technologies would become obsolete by the year 2040. “AI and MI are some of the future technologies that are going to shape our lives in the next two decades,” Dr. Narayana Rao said during the celebrations of Engineers Day on September 15, held to mark the birth anniversary of Bharat Ratna Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya. “Data and information will be available virtually as air. ‘Everything on the go’ will take on a literal meaning and the word ‘connect’ will be meaningless for most of our gadgets. Data will just move seamlessly whether you are in an elevator, car or an aeroplane,” he said. “AI and ML will make us believe that the world revolves around us. As we talk, discuss, act, AI will surround us with actions and suggestions and actionable inputs at a wink. AI will resemble Real Intelligence (RI). Driverless and automated intelligent cars will move around by themselves and self-park. People’s job profiles will change. They will need to work less and most routine and hazardous work will be carried out by robots. Typing on gadgets will be redundant and will be replaced by voice commands, gestures and even thought controls. Natural Language Processing (NLP) will remove the language barriers in trade and travel. NLP will do the translation of spoken language and will ensure a global world,” Dr. Narayana Rao said. “Space tourism will turn from fantasy into a reality. Holiday tours to Switzerland, Bali, and Seychelles will be replaced by tours to Venus, Mars and the moon,” he said, adding that 3D printing technology will be used to construct buildings, structures and several products within a few hours/days which presently takes months and years to do. “When our country became independent, India was the poorest of the poor countries with a literacy rate of just around 12% and a life expectancy of 32 years. Today, in 70 years, India has become one of the top five economies in the world.

A wild new “Cinematic” mode that uses <b>machine learning</b> for tricks like auto-shifting&nbsp;...",,"Here’s everything Apple announced at its event this morning Greg Kumparak @grg / 17 hours It’s that time again! It’s September, which generally means two things: We’re blasting Earth, Wind, and Fire on repeat, and Apple will announce a new iPhone (or four). Right on schedule, Apple held a remote event this morning, streaming kinda-sorta-live from its Cupertino campus. Whether you didn’t have time to watch the entire hour-long stream or just want the highlights, we’ve got you — as usual, we’ve boiled the whole thing down to the bullet points. New iPads Both the standard iPad and the iPad mini have gotten the update treatment — here’s whats new for each: Image Credits: Apple New iPad : Runs the A13 Bionic chip, which Apple first introduced in 2019 with the iPhone 11. Apple says it’s 20% faster across the board compared to the last gen. The front-facing camera has been bumped from 8 megapixels up to a 12 megapixel ultrawide lens. It’s getting Center Stage, the feature that debuted on the iPad Pro and automatically reframes front-facing video to keep your face centered as you move around a room. Starts at $329 (or $299 for schools). Orders start today, shipping next week. Image Credits: Apple New iPad mini : Redesigned with slimmer borders and rounder edges. The display has been bumped up to 8.3″ (from 7.9″) while keeping the overall device size the same. The CPU is 40% faster, while the GPU is 80% faster. USB-C! There will be a 5G model. The back camera has a much-improved 12 MP camera with True Tone flash, and, as with the standard iPad, the front camera is getting 12 MP ultrawide lens and Center Stage support. It’ll support the second-gen Apple Pencil. Starts at $499. Orders start today, shipping next week. Apple Watch Image Credits: Apple Apple kicked off the Watch segment with a few new features coming to iOS 8 (like fall detection for cyclists and better algorithms for detecting calories burned when you’re on an e-bike) before announcing a new Watch — Series 7, they’re calling it. Apple Watch Series 7 : By reducing the screen’s borders, they were able to squeeze in a display that is 20% bigger. To take advantage of that bigger screen, buttons are bigger across the UI. It’s got a swipe-style prediction keyboard, for easier text input on the go. Apple says it’s got the strongest (most crack-resistant) display to dat, and is the first Apple Watch to be IP6X certified against dust. An “updated charging architecture” and a new USB-C charger allow it to charge 33% faster. Series 7 will start at $399 and start shipping “later this fall.” New iPhones Image Credits: Apple Not one, not two, but four new iPhones — iPhone 13, iPhone 13 mini, iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro max. Faster chips, better cameras, better battery life. iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 mini : Both run Apple’s new A15 Bionic chip. It’s got a six-core CPU (two high-performance cores, four high efficiency), a four-core GPU and big improvements to the neural engine that Apple taps for on-device machine learning. A “ceramic shield front,” which Apple says is tougher than any other smartphone’s glass. IP68 water resistance. 28% brighter display. iPhone 13 comes in at 6.1″, while iPhone 13 mini will be 5.4″. A wild new “Cinematic” mode that uses machine learning for tricks like auto-shifting the camera’s focus when one on-screen speaker looks at someone behind them. The 64 GB model has finally been retired, with the base models coming with 128 GB of storage. Apple says the iPhone 13 mini’s battery life has been improved by an hour and a half, while most iPhone 13 users will get two and half more hours per charge. iPhone 13 will start at $799, while iPhone 13 mini starts at $699. iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max : Image Credits: Apple It’s getting that new “ceramic shield front,” along with an upgrade to A15, here with a five-core GPU. As rumored, it’ll get a display that can adjust its refresh rate up to 120 hz for super smooth movement/scrolling. It’s got three cameras on the back: a telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom, an ultrawide and a wide angle. Night Mode will now play friendly with all three cameras (including the telephoto lens, which previously didn’t support it). It’ll come in two sizes: 6.1″ (Pro) and 6.7″ (Pro Max). For those who just can’t seem to get enough storage space, they’re introducing 1 TB models! Pro starts at $999, Pro Max starts at $1099. Pre-orders start September 17, shipping September 24. Other stuff iOS 15 will ship Monday, September 20th. Apple’s Fitness Plus service is rolling out in 15 new countries , including Austria, Brazil, Colombia, France, Germany, Mexico and Russia. Workouts will be in English and subtitled in six languages. They’re also launching group workouts, which can be launched from iMessage or FaceTime and will let you multitask your hangouts and your workouts. Apple’s MagSafe wallet will now be able to display its last known location via the Find My app if the wallet gets separated from the phone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Scientist Nhan Tran, Jennifer Ngadiuba and other researchers at Fermilab will develop techniques for encoding advanced compression and filtering for use in a wide array of experimental settings, from particle physics experiments to electron microscopes. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced $13.7 million in funding for nine research projects that will advance the state of the art in computer science and applied mathematics. The projects – led by five universities and five DOE National Laboratories across eight states – will address the challenges of moving, storing, and processing the massive data sets produced by scientific observatories, experimental facilities, and supercomputers, accelerating the pace of scientific discoveries. As scientific user facilities upgrade and expand, their capacity for generating unwieldy amounts of scientific data has started to exceed scientists’ abilities to stream, archive, and analyze that data. This has created an urgent need to develop new mathematical and computer-science techniques to shrink these data sets by removing trivial or repetitive data while preserving the important scientific information that can lead to discovery. While the need for data reduction techniques is clear, the scientists using those techniques must trust that they are not losing important scientific information, and this presents a key challenge. Research supported by this program must address not only the efficiency and effectiveness of a data reduction technique, but its trustworthiness as well. “Scientific user facilities across the nation, including the DOE Office of Science, are producing data that could lead to exciting and important scientific discoveries, but the size of that data is creating new challenges,” said Barb Helland, Associate Director for Advanced Scientific Computing Research, DOE Office of Science. “Those discoveries can only be uncovered if the data is made manageable, and the techniques employed to do that are trusted by the scientists.” Projects selected in today’s announcement cover a wide range of topics that promise important innovations in data-reduction techniques, including techniques using advanced machine learning , large-scale statistical calculations, and novel hardware accelerators. A sample of the projects includes: Methods to compress streaming data: Researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory will develop techniques to compress data coming directly from a scientific instrument or a computer model by taking advantage of its specific structure and integrating advanced machine-learning techniques, while allowing scientists to control certain features of the data. Methods to intelligently select and tune compression techniques: Researchers at Texas State University will develop techniques to search the vast space of potential data compression techniques and select the best method based on the user’s requirements for fidelity, speed, and memory usage. Compression methods for related groups of data sets: Researchers at the University of California, San Diego will develop scalable techniques for compressing multiple related streams of data, such as those from multiple sensors observing the same physical system, by taking advantage of the relationships between the data sets. Methods for programming custom hardware accelerators for streaming compression: Researchers at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory will develop techniques for encoding advanced compression and filtering, including those based on machine learning methods, as custom hardware accelerators for use in a wide array of experimental settings, from particle physics experiments to electron microscopes. The projects are managed by the Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) program within the DOE Office of Science. The full list of projects and more information can be found here .

Everyone wants to gain the best skills for the data scientist job description now that data science is sweeping over the business world. Every day, 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are produced, and businesses want experts who can turn this data into insights and benefit from it. As organizations face difficulties that may only be handled via effective data analysis, data scientists are in high demand. Data science has undeniably become a critical component of organizations, allowing them to make well-informed judgements based on statistical data, trends, and figures. You must acquire the abilities necessary for data scientist roles in various firms and organizations to become an expert in the field. Now, let’s take a look at some of the essential skills that a data scientist needs. What’s a Data Scientist? A data scientist is in charge of accumulating and analyzing massive, organised and unstructured data collections. These positions use math, statistics, and computer science abilities to decipher large amounts of data and then apply the information to develop commercial solutions. In order to produce meaningful strategies, data scientists collect, analyze, model, and evaluate data utilising anything from technology to market dynamics. They also make certain that the data has been adequately cleaned and confirmed, as well as that it is correct and full. Essential Skills for Data Scientists The more advanced your job, like with most occupations, the more talents you’ll need to succeed. Nevertheless, regardless of your job, there are some skills you’ll require to be an expert in if you want to become a data scientist. Fundamentals One of the most important talents for data scientist job descriptions is a solid understanding of basic ideas and basics. Matrices and linear algebra functions, relational algebra, hash functions, and binary tree, extract transform load, database basics and more are among the foundations. Math and Statistics Any excellent data scientist will have a strong mathematical and statistical basis. Any company, particularly one that is data-driven, will require a data scientist to be familiar with various statistical techniques, such as maximum likelihood estimation methods, distributors, and statistical measures, in order to assist in making recommendations and choices. Calculus and linear algebra are both important since machine learning algorithms rely on them. Programming A data scientist needs excellent programming abilities to progress from the theoretical to the creation of real applications. Most employers will want you to be fluent in Python, R, and other coding languages. This category includes object-oriented coding, fundamental syntax, and functions, libraries, flow control statements and documentation. Data Visualization Being a data scientist necessitates the ability to effectively communicate essential messaging and gain buy-in for offered solutions, which necessitates the use of data visualization. Learning how to break down complicated information into manageable, more digestible chunks and use a range of visual aids (graphs, charts, and more) is a talent that every data scientist will need to master in order to grow in their profession. Analytics and Modelling Because data is only as good as the individuals who analyze and model it, a professional data scientist is expected to be well-versed in this field. A data scientist should be able to examine data, perform tests, and develop models to acquire new insights and anticipate probable outcomes built on a foundation of both analytical thinking and communication. Machine Learning Methods A skilled data scientist is required to be well-versed in this subject because data is as good as the people who examine and model it. A data scientist should be able to evaluate data, run tests, and create models to get new insights and predict likely outcomes, all while maintaining a strong analytical and communicative foundation. Intellectual Curiosity A genuine interest to solve issues and create answers especially those that demand some unconventional thinking is at the core of the data science position. Because data is meaningless on its own, a great data scientist is motivated by a desire to understand more about what the data is telling them and how that information may be used on a wider scale. Business Acumen A certain amount of business acumen is necessary for a data scientist to properly use data in a way that is useful to their company. You must completely comprehend the company’s major objectives and goals, as well as how they affect your job. You must also be able to develop solutions that satisfy those objectives in a cost-effective, simple-to-implement and widely adopted manner. Communication Data cannot communicate until it is manipulated, which necessitates excellent communication abilities in a data scientist. Communication may make all the difference in the success of a project, whether it’s communicating to your team what actions you want to take to go from point A to point B with the data or making a presentation to company leadership. Conclusion These are the most important skills that a data scientist must-have. Data science is a field that is continuously changing, therefore it’s critical to maintain your data science skills up to date if you want to become an expert in the area. Because data scientists are committed to sharing their results with important stakeholders, they must be able to not only handle data but also interpret and convey findings across the company.

Sicker will retain his role as senior associate dean for computing within the College of Engineering, Design and Computing on a reduced load basis while serving in this interim capacity. Studies show significant job growth in computing and tech talent in the Denver metro region . Positioning CU Denver as a provider of workforce talent for the state in key growth areas is why the campus needs to organize for interdisciplinary conversations and leverage faculty expertise in these areas, Nakuma said. Douglas Sicker “As an equity-serving, urban research university determined to make education work for all, CU Denver understands that creating opportunities for broader access to cutting-edge programs in interdisciplinary computing, including computational thinking, programming AI, data science, and other aspects of computing is an important first step in a more comprehensive strategic vision,” Nakuma said. “I can’t think of anyone better to lead our efforts in this field than Dr. Sicker, whose expertise in network systems, wireless systems, cybersecurity, and public policy will be a great asset to the task force as they plan our computing future.” The task force, to be appointed and charged by Nakuma and Chancellor Michelle Marks, will analyze existing assets and assess workforce capacity in the context of the campus Strategic Plan . In addition to the visioning, the task force will identify high-value projects to pursue in the next three years, which will likely include new degree programs in data science and cybersecurity, new modular credentials in computing writ large, recommendations for complementary research programs, and computing infrastructure. “CU Denver sits at the perfect place and time to broaden access to computing skills and resources for students,” Sicker said. “As we initiate this task force, it is with the recognition that computational approaches will be tailored to our various colleges and departments, but that we have a unique opportunity to rethink the potential of the many roles that computing should play in all of our students’ studies in an integrative manner. Our goal is to enhance all areas of study by weaving computational thinking into them, also creating an environment where the complex problem-solving skills that are so in demand are ubiquitously accessible to our student body. This will be a critical ingredient in fostering equity and play a vital role in conferring a meaningful advantage to our students.” Sicker, who joined the CU Denver faculty last year , came from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), where he was the Lord Endowed Chair Professor in Computer Science and Engineering. At CMU, he served as a department head in Engineering, as well as interim director of the CyLab Institute for Security and Privacy , the nation’s leading center for cybersecurity. Sicker also has extensive experience and notable accomplishments at high levels in both the private and public sectors. He served the nation as Chief Technology Officer (CTO) for the Federal Communications Commission and later as CTO for the Department of Commerce (NTIA). In his roles as CTO, Sicker led numerous government initiatives related to our national broadband infrastructure and spectrum management. Prior to his service in government, he was the director of global architecture at Level 3 Communications, now Lumen.

By eWEEK EDITORS - September 14, 2021 Share Facebook Twitter Linkedin During the recent Tesla AI Day event, Elon Musk said he discourages “machine learning, because it is really difficult. Unless you have to use machine learning, don’t do it.” Well, Musk may be right in his assessment, because machine learning is quite difficult to implement. Most companies desire the benefits of what artificial intelligence can achieve for their business, but most don’t have what it takes to get it up and running. Therefore, as much as 85% of ML projects currently fail. The takeaway from Musk’s startling statement is that organizations can’t treat AI, of which machine learning is a subset, like a part-time project. Many businesses are making some important mistakes when trying to do AI. But it doesn’t have to be this way. Below are five data points from Bin Zhao, Ph.D., Lead Data Scientist at Datatron, showing some common mistakes of AI implementation. 1. Careful: this isn’t traditional software development Don’t treat AI/ML development like traditional software development. Developing AI/ML models is a much different process than software development, but many organizations try to apply the traditional software development lifecycle to manage AI/ML models. Machine Learning development lifecycle (MLLC) takes much more time because of additional factors including translating AI algorithms to compatible software codes, unique infrastructure requirements, the need for frequent model iterations, and more. Compared to traditional programming languages, it can take more than five times as long. This means today’s typical application release processes are simply not applicable. 2. Using or standardizing the wrong tools can hamper data scientists’ productivity This type of tools mistake introduces unnecessary delays and inefficiencies. In most IT situations, organizations can control the types of servers they buy, the software tools they use, the dependencies they build with and so on. Not so with AI/ML; organizations must allow their data scientists to use their preferred tools based on what they think will get the job done in the best way. Otherwise, they’re likely to see all their data scientists leave. 3. IT/DevOps staff can lack ML expertise DevOps is the union of software development and operations with the goals of reducing solution delivery time and sustaining a good user experience through automation (e.g. CI/CD and monitoring). But DevOps experts don’t know the nuances of working with ML models. MLOps is a new term that expresses how to apply DevOps rules to automate the building, testing and deployment of ML systems. The goal of MLOps is to unite ML application development and the operation of ML applications, making it easier for groups to deploy finer models more often. 4. Beware of the misalignment of the skill sets of data scientists Data scientists need the right raw data for modeling, and they excel in uncovering data to build the best models to solve business challenges. However, that does not mean they are experts in all the intricacies of deploying models to work with existing applications and infrastructure. This causes friction between them and the engineering team and business leaders, resulting in low job satisfaction for data scientists. Though highly skilled and trained, they must rely on others for deployment and production, which also means that they can’t iterate rapidly. And since the projects shift to the engineering team, who don’t have the ML skill set, it’s easy for them to miss details – especially if the model is not making accurate predictions. 5. Don’t get too caught up in the romance of academic AI research vs. business reality Academic AI research has historically focused on developing models and algorithms. Limited efforts have been devoted towards iterating and improving data sets for a specific business problem, operationalizing a machine learning model or monitoring models in production. Building and deploying a machine learning model for solving a real world problem is much more than developing the algorithm itself. A sound plan for ML success Operationalizing ML models is hard but not impossible. Using a new model development life cycle will streamline the process of model development and model production. It does this by helping data scientists, engineering and other involved teams make effective decisions in a timely manner. It will also help teams to reduce production risks. A successful model governance tool can also help by standardizing processes, simplifying governance and significantly reducing risks.

You know that you need to use the same tools, if not better ones. AI security is about having the right tools, but also about having the right information. But you aren’t sure where to start your AI security journey, and you aren’t alone. Many business or agency leaders are in the exact same place and have the same questions. I’ve talked with many companies that are in various stages of the AI journey. And I’ve seen firsthand that, for many, deep learning is a good first step toward using AI-based security. Is Deep Learning for Security the Same as AI Security? Yes and no; deep learning is a type of machine learning. And yes, machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence . The goal of AI, whether that’s AI security or otherwise, is to mimic the human brain. When you read or watch information on a topic, you learn more about that subject. Then, you can better make logic-based decisions and predictions. As a human, there is a limit to the amount, speed and complexity of the information you take in. But AI engines can process much higher volumes, at faster speeds. AI trains itself by consuming data from both structured and unstructured sources and then uses reason to make suggestions. And as quantum computing becomes more common in the coming years, AI will become even more powerful. How Is Deep Learning Different From Machine Learning? They are similar, but each type of AI is better suited for different tasks. So, they use different techniques for almost the same purpose. With classical machine learning , the AI algorithm must pre-process unstructured data to organize it into a structured format before using it. Deep learning processes unstructured data (e.g., text and images) just as it is. This makes its processing of unstructured data faster and more accurate. Deep learning uses two unique methods to learn and reason: propagation and backpropagation. During the former, the deep learning algorithm moves through layers that build on each other. Because of this, the way it processes and predicts data is more accurate. Backpropagation relies on the algorithm to look for errors in predictions. Next, it uses that information to train the model more accurately. Why Is Deep Learning a Good Option for Cybersecurity? When using AI for cybersecurity, you must first train the model on the right topics and methods. Many of the sources needed in this field (such as message boards) are unstructured. So, deep learning allows you to collect more information on potential threats, which can then be used to predict potential risk. Without this unstructured data, AI algorithms are likely to be less accurate. The next step is using what you’ve collected and the insights AI provides to spot potential threats, such as malicious files, suspicious IP addresses or employees performing actions that are potential insider attacks. However, AI cybersecurity is only effective if it predicts the threats right. While overlooking potential threats can be harmful, false positives force people to waste time that could be spent preventing actual threats. Propagation and backpropagation increase the AI’s accuracy  — and keep your data better protected. How Do I Start Using Deep Learning for AI Security? Your first step toward using AI security is to select a tool that uses AI to analyze and predict threats. When researching different tools, look for one that uses deep learning as its cornerstone. This will ensure it’s accurate and will help your team spend their energy on the highest risk threats. By using deep learning, you can decrease both your risk and the time spent on detecting threats, which allows your team to focus on work that needs the human touch.

The inaugural cohort of Corning Scholars and Fellows includes students majoring in bioengineering, chemical engineering, civil engineering, computer science, computer engineering, data science and engineering, information technology, industrial systems engineering, mechanical engineering, and more. The partnership is the result of a $5.5 million gift from Corning, which was announced in January, and is designed to prepare students for careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and graduate more teachers from minority communities. “This partnership addresses a critical need to diversify the STEM workforce by investing in an entire education ecosystem,” said Paula Groves Price, dean of A&T’s College of Education and president of the American Educational Studies Association, in a statement . “While many corporations might invest only in scholarships to recruit STEM graduates, Corning’s approach is much impactful for current and future A&T students. They are invested in not only supporting the diversification of the teaching profession but also improving access and experiences for students in communities across the state.” During the event, N.C. A&T and Corning leaders met and shared lunch with 30 of the Corning Scholars and Fellows. “This is a proud day for Corning as we celebrate these young scholars at North Carolina A&T State University who inspire us with their hard work, intellectual curiosity, and enormous potential,” said Michael A. Bell, senior vice president, and general manager of Corning’s Optical Communications business. “The first class of Corning Scholars and Fellows represent some of the bright young minds that will help fuel Corning with the diverse talent we need to continue our record of life-changing innovation for another 170 years.” Following the luncheon, Corning representatives visited the College of Education, College of Engineering, College of Science and Technology, and the Willie A. Deese College of Business and Economics. The day concluded with a reception, during which recruiting staff were available to talk about careers at Corning.

By Maddy Savage Business reporter, Stockholm Published 3 hours ago Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image source, Ewa-Lena Rasmusson image caption Ewa-Lena Rasmusson has suffered from arthritis in her knees From stumbling slowly out of bed, to doing active weights classes at the gym, Ewa-Lena Rasmusson's mobility has transformed during the pandemic. The 55-year-old, from Stockholm, says it's all thanks to a Swedish app that uses artificial intelligence to create bespoke exercise plans designed to help alleviate joint pain. Every day the app sends Ms Rasmusson a ""nudge"" to remind her to do a series of repetitions for five minutes, such as squats and leg lifts. Video demonstrations help ensure she understands the correct technique, and her training is adjusted according to her feedback on how challenging or painful she finds it. There's also a chat function within the app so she can message a real-life physiotherapist, who arranges regular video call check-ins too. ""I can really feel the difference,"" says Ms Rasmusson, who has struggled with knee pain. When she began the treatment back in March 2020 she could only manage a handful of squats, and now she is proudly ""up to 21."" Alongside lifting barbells, she's recently been able to get back into cycling, and has even booked a family ski trip for next year. The app, called Joint Academy, launched in 2014 with the goal of improving treatment for osteoarthritis. It was co-founded by Leif Dahlberg, a professor of orthopedics at Lund University in southern Sweden, and his son Jakob, now 30, who dropped out of his degree in computer sciences to launch the start-up. image source, Joint Academy image caption Father and son team Jakob and Leif Dahlberg are now expanding their business overseas The company says it offers an alternative to waiting in line for face-to-face physiotherapy, and solves the problem of patients being steered towards ""high risk"" and ""expensive"" operations, without the chance to try simpler treatments first. During the pandemic, the younger Mr Dahlberg says the platform's user base has ""leapfrogged maybe two or three years"" ahead of its predicted growth. Despite Sweden opting against formal lockdowns, operations were postponed across the country, seniors' exercise classes were cancelled, and patients and healthcare workers alike sought to limit face-to-face contact. Almost 50,000 people have used Joint Academy since April last year, the company says, compared to 15,000 during its first six years in business. It is now the most common first-line treatment of chronic joint pain in Sweden. ""People with chronic ailments are often in the high-risk group for Covid, and in the pandemic they shouldn't be running into the clinic to get support,"" explains Jakob. ""So it was very good for us to offload and reallocate resources in healthcare."" Joint Academy is a licensed physiotherapy provider in Sweden. It makes its money from regional healthcare authorities who pick up the bill for placing patients on its digital physiotherapy programmes. Some patients are also referred via private health insurance providers. The company has raised 295m Swedish krona ($34.2m; £24.8m) in funding and had a turnover of 64m krona in 2020. image source, Prykhodov image caption The Joint Academy app guides the user through exercises The app's success is part of a wider boom in specialist digital healthcare services in Sweden. These include Blodtrycksdoktorn, which offers bespoke treatment for patients with high blood pressure, migraine help service Migränhjälpen, and Mindler which gives online access to psychologists. Around one in five Swedes used a digital healthcare app in autumn 2020, according to The Swedish Internet Foundation, including almost one in 10 pensioners. Roger Molin is a digital healthcare expert, and a former national coordinator for chronic disease treatments.  He says that the trend towards such health apps isn't surprising in a country with a tech-savvy population, and a long history of developing digital innovations, from Spotify to payments platform Klarna. ""I think they are really user-friendly,"" he says of the digital healthcare apps he's seen. He believes even greater public investment in digital healthcare is the answer to easing pressure on the health service in Sweden which, like many European countries, is battling with an ageing population. New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape. ""If you are going to increase efficiency in Swedish healthcare, then you need to do something for people with chronic conditions, because people with chronic conditions stand for most of the costs in healthcare."" But not everyone is as excited. Sofia Rydgren Stale, who chairs the Swedish Medical Association, says that although healthcare apps are of ""great importance"" to the development of the country's healthcare system, there are ongoing debates about how to regulate the industry. Concerns include monitoring the competences of therapists and doctors working for digital apps, and worries about ""very aggressive marketing"" from some of the private companies behind them. ""We also need more research,"" says Ms Stale. ""When is it most appropriate to use a digital tool and when is it not?"" Plus, while Swedes tend to have a high level of digital literacy, she's worried some vulnerable residents will find it harder than others to access app-based services, which could fuel inequality if these are prioritised in future. ""The healthcare sector should be open to everybody,"" she insists. image source, Getty Images image caption About a quarter of people will suffer from arthritis during their life But Jakob Dahlberg, who is Joint Academy's chief executive, is far from worried about any criticism, pointing to the results of the firm's 10 peer-reviewed clinical studies. Recent research by the University of Nottingham found that patients using the app saw their pain levels reduced by 41% after six weeks, whereas the figure for those receiving traditional care was just 6%. ""It works. There's really no more need to argue than that: the data speaks the truth,"" says Jakob. For around 2,500 users, like Agneta Sjödin Portinson from Östersund in northern Sweden, the impact has even been so dramatic they've changed their minds about having surgery. ""I was very close to having an operation because I didn't see any other way out of it,"" says the 58-year-old. Her hip pain used to be so severe she couldn't sleep at night, and often struggled to put on her shoes and socks in the morning. ""Now it's all good… when I walk for a long time I might feel it a little when I get home, but other times, not at all,"" says Ms Portinson. Jakob says Joint Academy now has ""very big and global ambitions"". It recently launched in the US, and is planning to branch out into other European countries and add lower back pain to its treatment offering. In the UK - where around 10 million people have arthritis or other conditions that affect the joints - the app is already available, although it's not currently funded by the NHS. image source, Ewa-Lena Rasmusson image caption Ewa-Lena Rasmusson is now able to enter organised cycle rides again Back in Sweden, Joint Academy users like Ms Rasmusson are confident the app's appeal will endure, even in countries where social-distancing recommendations have been relaxed, and physical appointments are more accessible again. For her, a major part of the appeal has been skipping the journey to and from a traditional physiotherapy appointment, which she says would have been a hassle even before the pandemic. ""Travelling to the centre of Stockholm, getting help there, I would not have done it,"" she says. ""I think that if I would not have got the app... I would have been in a terrible state.""

By Adam Rosenberg on September 19, 2021 Even with Full Self-Driving enabled, you've got to keep your hands on the wheel and pay attention to the road in any Tesla vehicle. Credit: tesla > Tech > Transportation Elon Musk has been promising a wider rollout of Tesla's Full Self-Driving program for months. Now, just a couple days after his latest tweet on the matter, U.S. authorities are asking Tesla to slow its roll. The National Transportation Safety Board, a federal agency tasked with investigating all manner of vehicular accidents and vehicle safety, would like Tesla to hold off on its wider launch of FSD, citing safety concerns. The agency doesn't have the authority to make that an order, but its publicly shared recommendation still carries plenty of weight. ""Basic safety issues have to be addressed before they’re then expanding it to other city streets and other areas,"" NTSB head Jennifer Homendy said in a Wall Street Journal interview . She added that Tesla's ""Full Self-Driving"" branding ""has clearly misled numerous people to misuse and abuse technology."" Homendy takes issue with the name of Tesla's feature because it's a marketing term that creates the ""misleading and irresponsible"" impression among consumers that FSD is fully in command of the car. But the driver-assistance feature depends on there being a responsible and attentive driver at the wheel. Tesla's expects its customers to follow those guidelines, to be clear. A support page for both FSD and Autopilot, the standard driver assistance feature include with all Tesla vehicles, notes that both features ""are intended for use with a fully attentive driver, who has their hands on the wheel and is prepared to take over at any moment."" These features, which are powered by machine learning, are built to get smarter over time as Tesla's fleet of vehicles spends more time on the road. But Tesla's support page explicitly notes that ""the currently enabled features do not make the vehicle autonomous."" Homendy's point is that a support page isn't what most customers are seeing up front. Instead, they're getting feature names like ""Autopilot"" and ""Full Self-Driving,"" which, in the NTSB's view, creates a false impression of any given Tesla's driver assistance capabilities. SEE ALSO: Tesla's Autopilot under investigation by the feds The FSD feature still isn't widely available, though it's up and running in a relatively small beta program that includes only a few thousand drivers. But Musk said on Friday that the beta was a week away from going wider, and that Tesla drivers who opt in will spend a week having their driving patterns monitored before they're approved (or not) for beta participation. Between the NTSB recommendation and mounting state-level interest in scrutinizing Tesla's plans, that rollout may have to wait a little longer.

Network Security Market 2021 Home Networks By Leon Yen September 19, 2021 Innovation. IT futurists have long predicted the eventual disappearance of the so-called perimeter, but the truth is that physical networks — and the solutions for securing them — are far from their last days. And while the cloud has heralded the arrival of infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) and software-defined networks (SDN), at the end of the day, these services are delivered out of physical data centers, albeit distributed and dispersed across the globe. For traditional firms with on-premises IT infrastructures, network security continues to increase in complexity in order to keep up with ever-sophisticated cyber attackers. Whether on premises or in the cloud, IT infrastructures are prone to the same security issues and are equally exposed to cyber threats. However, with today’s networks supporting a vastly greater number of users, devices, and Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, the enterprise attack surface’s composition has evolved significantly even when compared to just a few years ago. Network Security Today Today’s network security offerings range from traditional intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) to next-generation firewalls (NGFW) and unified threat management (UTM) devices that serve multiple security functions in one appliance. More recently, the network detection and response (NDR) category has emerged to describe solutions that utilize artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) and other non-signature based methods to detect advanced threats lurking in the network. These solutions are also designed to work well with other tools for streamlined remediation, threat hunting, and more. Network Security Market The network security market is anticipated to increase from $27.39 billion in 2021 to $60.38 billion in 2028, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.0% during the forecast period. Drivers such as the global shift to working from home and the resulting spike in remote access have resulted in higher enterprise network traffic and number of varying devices — this in turn translates to more risk exposure to threats like ransomware and bothers. Benefits of Network Security Today’s enterprise networks tend to be a mix of on-premises, cloud (IaaS), and sensor/IoT networks at the edge. Now more than ever, comprehensive network security is critical to ensuring that excessive cyber risk exposure doesn’t impact the business. This means being able to collectively monitor and mitigate the cyber risk exposure of these heterogeneous network environments via a single pane of glass. Additionally, the ML-powered insights provided by today’s network security solutions enable businesses to shore up their defenses against continuously evolving cyber threats. Interestingly, many of today’s network security offerings are cloud-based and can therefore scale in real-time to the firm’s needs as well as secure IaaS environments natively. Several vendors use a similar deployment architecture consisting of network security devices deployed on premises or in the cloud, managed by a cloud-based security orchestration platform. See more: Key Cybersecurity Trends 2021 Network Security Use Cases The enterprise IT security market is fairly saturated with numerous players in many cases offering overlapping solutions. IDPS and UTM are commonly bundled into a single device (i.e., the NGFW) these days, though a handful of vendors develop special intrusion detection (IDS) sensors for special use cases (e.g., for monitoring vessel networks). The IoT and industrial control system (ICS) network monitoring space is experiencing a surge in demand — especially for use in environments like manufacturing facilities, energy stations, automotive assembly lines, and more. With many of these industries undergoing digital transformation, the need for monitoring the supporting networks for threats is being addressed by a growing number of players. That said, the operational technology (OT) network security space is still relatively new, with room for new disruptors. More than a few vendors market their solutions under the NDR category. These offerings focus on network traffic analysis use cases for the modern enterprise. More often, these centralized NDR platforms combine threat detection with security workflow automation, auto-remediation, threat hunting, and more. Network Security Providers The following are 10 leading vendors that provide solutions for network security, from UTMs and smart firewalls to AI-powered network anomaly detection and NDR solutions. ExtraHop ExtraHop provides continuous network monitoring through its Reveal(x) EDR platform. It’s cloud-based solution features auto-discovery and auto-classification capabilities for real-time visibility into IT infrastructures both on-premise and virtualized/cloud-based. Fortinet A leader in network security, Fortinet has developed its flagship FortiGate NGFW with advanced UTM capabilities in a unified smart firewall device, enabling customers to more easily monitor/protect their networks via a single pane-of-glass. Sophos An established name in network security, Sophos offers a NGFW with enterprise-grade firewall capabilities as well as advanced features for protecting against modern cyber threats such as advanced malware, drive-by downloads, botnets, and more. Tenable Tenable is perhaps most well-known for its Nessus vulnerability scanner; however, its solutions for enterprise network visibility are also popular for detecting, identifying, and mitigating threats across an organization’s entire IT computing fabric — be it on premises, in the cloud, or in an industrial/operational technology (OT) environment. Claroty A leader in OT network security, Claroty has developed a platform that provides industrial enterprises with comprehensive network visibility, monitoring, and threat detection. Its solution was designed to monitor both standard IT networks as well as OT environments with industrial control systems (ICS) and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems present. Vectra Vectra’s platform monitors both on-premise and cloud-based networks with AI-powered capabilities for advanced threat detection and risk awareness. By using machine learning (ML) to enrich the network metadata collected, organizations can perform more contextual, accurate assessments regarding their network risk. Fidelis Cybersecurity The Fidelis Network is an NDR platform that provides monitoring for both individual endpoints as well as entire networks. Like Vectra (and many others), the solution uses AI/ML for enriching network metadata in network security analytics and threat hunting use cases. VMware VMware is most well-known as the leader in the virtual machine space, but it also offers a range of enterprise cybersecurity solutions. Its NSX platform (previously Lastline Defender) was designed to detect advanced network threats and security incidents in both on-premise and cloud networks Forescout While Forescout offers a range of traditional enterprise network monitoring tools, the company has positioned itself as a security provider for the “enterprise of things” — or enterprise networks supporting a combination of IT, OT, and IoT devices. Darktrace Darktrace’s AI-powered cybersecurity suite enables enterprises to automatically detect network anomalies and advanced threats — malicious signals that may be difficult to recognize using standard network monitoring tools and IDPS solutions. Conclusions Network security continues to evolve as organizations become more heterogeneous in their IT environments. From the cloud to the edge, modern enterprises require solutions that are both streamlined for centralized management yet flexible enough to monitor any type of network deployment, be it virtualized/cloud-based or on premises, traditional computing or IoT sensor-based. And as malicious actors continue to evolve in their capabilities, network security controls must also be highly adaptable. To this end, today’s leading AI/ML-powered NDR platforms are redefining the next generation of network security solutions.

language processing - Adds revenue generating service to existing and expanded Dubber customer base - Delivers product capabilities that enrich Dubber Foundation and broader service provider offering - Accelerates Dubber's AI program and expands Dubber core offerings - Circa A$6.6m acquisition by way of cash and equity News provided by Dubber Sep 19, 2021, 19:55 ET Share this article Share this article MELBOURNE, Australia , Sept. 19, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Dubber Corporation Limited (ASX: DUB) (Dubber) announces today that it has acquired Brisbane, Australia based technology group Notiv ( https://www.notiv.com) . Notiv is a developer of innovative cloud-native AI-based products that turn meetings into transcribed notes, summaries, signals, actions, and more. Steve McGovern , CEO, Dubber: ""One of our fundamental beliefs is that artificial intelligence has a part to play as a standard feature of every call and conversation. Notiv is a significant step towards achieving this in that it has clear and defined use cases for everyone from individuals to the largest of enterprises. With Notiv, Dubber will now have the ability to automatically take notes and create action items on every call. We are confident that our telecommunications carrier and service provider partners will see enormous potential for revenue-generating value-added services for their customers at scale. We welcome the Notiv team to Dubber along with the AI and data science expertise they bring. We see the teams combining to form the core of our Dubber AI Labs for developing future AI capabilities. The integration of the Notiv business is accretive for both parties in that Dubber can expose the fantastic capability of the Notiv offering to a global customer base and the Notiv team can develop a continuous stream of revenue-generating services for Dubber's addressable market. Dubber's overall strategy is to grow organic Annualised Recurring Revenue (ARR) while augmenting that growth with strategic acquisitions where possible. Acquisitions must either add accretive and synergistic revenue or provide substantial product and technology capability, which will drive organic ARR growth. The Notiv acquisition reflects that strategy perfectly, and the speed at which the parties have executed the transaction now enables the Company to continue to pursue other identified opportunities."" Notiv will be available to Dubber Foundation Partners, select service and solution providers and sold alongside other Dubber solutions for businesses and Government. Chris Raethke , Co-Founder & CEO, Notiv: ""The Notiv team is exceptionally proud of the technology we have developed. The ability to roll out Notiv globally with the world's leading service providers is an unmissable opportunity. The chance to join the Dubber growth journey at this time and expand Dubber's AI and NLP capabilities is exciting for all of us. We are confident that the combination of Dubber and Notiv will deliver incredible value to customers, businesses and our fellow shareholders alike."" James Slaney , COO, Dubber: ""Dubber has over 150 global service provider network partners as well as all of the world's primary unified communications solutions - and is the only true native, cloud-first service of its kind. Our strategy has always been to use this footprint to deliver layers of value and drive associated revenues. Notiv suits this strategy perfectly and accelerates our existing AI program in three ways. First, we gain an exciting and proven product built to answer a compelling use case - making meetings better by automatically enabling voice data to replace or improve note taking.  We believe that the ability to create notes, highlights and action items in every video and phone call provides invaluable use cases for every demographic, from individuals to large enterprises, thereby expanding Dubber's already large addressable market. Enhanced productivity can benefit everybody in all methods of communication. For example, a tradesperson on a mobile phone call could instantly capture customer requests and share the actions. Likewise, C-level executives could use Notiv to note and capture actions in a planning meeting. Second, we believe that the ability to deliver this capability directly from the network will be a compelling proposition for both existing and new service provider partners.  As well as the opportunity for service providers to drive new services, incremental revenue and differentiation, we believe that Notiv is an ideal product to increase the value of our industry-first Foundation Partner program. Finally, Notiv will provide Dubber with a world-class team with deep expertise in AI and data science. Together we will accelerate our overall product roadmap and capabilities and advance our AI, digital signal processing and natural language processing technologies. Notiv furthers our leadership in capturing and transforming conversations between one person and another - and large groups of people in a meeting. We are continuing to unlock the potential of AI on every end-point and enabling our service and solution providers to make the critical shift from selling connectivity to extracting the value in every conversation on their networks. They'll now be able to do that with Dubber Notiv on the same hyper-secure, scalable and compliant infrastructure that Dubber has already made available to over 150 service providers globally - including all the world's leading UC solutions."" Key Transaction Terms: Dubber has acquired Notiv through the purchase of all of the issued share capital of holding company Pinch Labs, Inc., a US corporation that wholly owns and operates the Brisbane -based operations and technology Aggregate consideration of approximately A$6.6 million A$5.15 million paid in cash at completion and the balance, representing 24.8% of the consideration, is to be satisfied by way of the issue of 386,277 Dubber fully paid ordinary shares at a deemed issued price of A$3.75 .  The shares will be issued within Dubber's existing Listing Rule 7.1 issue capacity Key management and employees are to stay with the business, including Chris Raethke , Co-Founder & CEO and Dr Iain McCowan , Co-Founder and CTO The agreement also includes provisions customary for a transaction of this nature, including warranties and representations, confidentiality and non-competition/solicitation Strategic Rationale Accretive fundamentals. Proven application and technology with customers with strong product-market fit and alignment to the Dubber solution set Enriches Dubber's service and solution provider offering - and current product offerings.

AI Annie is the founder of Lips, an inclusive creative sharing platform. Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Law Library Giammarco via Unsplash AI is becoming more and more prevalent in society, with many people wondering how it will affect the law. How artificial intelligence is impacting our laws and what we can expect for future technology/legal interactions. The conversation surrounding the relationship between AI and law also touches quite clearly on the ability to rely on Artificial Intelligence to deliver fair decisions and to enhance the legal system’s delivery of equity and justice. In this article, I share insights from my conversations on this topic with Joilson Melo, a Brazilian law expert, and programmer whose devotion to equity and fairness led to a historic change in the Brazilian legal system in 2019, this change mainly affected the system that controls all processes processed digitally in Brazil, the PJe (Electronic Judicial Process). As a law student, Melo filed a request for action in the National Council of Justice (CNJ) against the Court of Justice of Mato Grosso, resulting in a decision allowing citizens to file applications in court electronically without a lawyer and within the Special Court, observing the value of the case, so that it does not exceed 20 minimum wages. Melo’s petition revealed provisions in the law that allowed for this and his victory enforced those provisions. The results for the underprivileged and those who couldn’t afford lawyers have been immense. On the relationship between AI and the Law, Melo remains a bit on the fence; “The purpose of the law is justice, equity, and fairness,” says Melo. MORE FOR YOU The Social Impact Case For Artificial Intelligence’s Role In Achieving Global Financial And Health Equality The Changing Face Of High Tech Fashion: How Two Entrepreneurs Are Bringing Diversity And AI To Clothing Design AI And Advanced Analytics In Shipping And Logistics: An Interview With Gregory Brown And Laura Patel, UPS “Any technology that can enhance that is welcome in the legal arena. Artificial Intelligence has already been shown that it can be as biased as the data that it is fed. This instantly places a greater burden of care on us to ensure that it is adopted through a careful process in the legal space and society at large” AI And Court Decisions The use of AI to predict jury verdicts has been around for quite some time now, but it's unclear whether or not an algorithm can accurately predict human behavior. There have also been studies that prove that machine learning algorithms can be used to help judges make sentencing decisions based on factors such as recidivism rates. In theory, this seems to solve a glaring problem, the algorithm tools are supposed to predict criminal behavior and help judges make decisions based on data-driven recommendations and not their gut. However, as Melo explains, this also presents some deep concerns for legal experts, “AI risk assessment tools run on algorithms that are trained on historical crime data. In countries like America and many other nations, law enforcement has already been accused of targeting certain minorities and this is shown by the high number of these minorities in prisons. If the same data is fed, the AI is going to be just as biased.” Melo continues, “Besides, the Algorithms turn correlative insights into causal insights. If the data shows that a particular neighborhood is correlated with high recidivism, it doesn’t prove that this neighborhood caused recidivism in any given case. These are things that a Judge should be able to tell from his observations. Anything less is a far cry from justice, unless we figure out a way to cure the data.” AI and Data Protection As we continue developing smarter technologies, data protection becomes an increasingly important issue. This includes protecting private information from hackers and complying with GDPR standards across all industries that collect personal data about their customers. Apart from the GDPR, not many countries have passed targeted laws that affect big data. According to the 2018 Technology Survey by the International Legal Technology Association , 100 percent of law firms with 700 or more lawyers use AI tools or are pursuing AI projects. If this trend continues and meets with the willingness of courts and judges to adopt AI, then they would eventually fall into the category of companies that need to abide by the data protection rules. Client/Attorney privilege could be at risk of a hack and court decisions as well. The need for stringent local laws that help regulate how data is received and managed has never been more clear, and this is why it is shocking that many governments have not acted faster. Joilson Melo Joilson Melo “Many governments have an unholy alliance with tech giants and the companies that deal most with data,” says Melo. “These companies are at the front of national development and are the most attractive national propositions for investments. Leaders do not want to stifle them or be seen as impeding technological advancement. However, if the law must apply equally, governments should take a cue from the GDPR and start now before we see privacy violation worse than we already have.” Legal Questions Surrounding AI As Artificial Intelligence becomes more ingrained in our lives, so do the legal issues that surround it. One of the most prevalent legal questions is whether machines should be allowed to possess self-driving cars and deadly weapons. Self-driving cars are already on the market but they have a long way to go before they could replace human drivers. The technology has not been perfected yet and will require huge strides forward before we can say with certainty that these vehicles are safe for society at large. The larger concerns about these touch on how easily these algorithms can be hacked and influenced externally. AI and Weapons/War Crimes: The possibility of autonomous weapons systems has been touted in many spheres as a powerful way to identify and eliminate threats. This has come against strong pushback for obvious reasons. Empathy, concession, and a certain big-picture approach have always played crucial roles in war and border security. These are traits that we still cannot inculcate into an algorithm. Human Rights Questions: One of the main questions that arise in the area of human rights is with regards to algorithmic transparency. There have been reports of people losing jobs, being denied loans, and being put on no-fly zones with no explanation other than, “it was an algorithmic determination.” If this pattern persists the risk to human rights is enormous. The questions of cybersecurity vulnerabilities, AI bias, and lack of contestability are also concerns that touch on human rights. Melo’s concern seems more targetted at the law and how it can be preserved as an arbiter of justice and enforcer of human rights and he rightly points out the implications of leaving these questions unanswered; “Deciding not to adopt AI in society and legal systems is deciding not to move forward as a civilization,” Melo comments. “However, deciding to adopt AI blindly would see us move back into a barbaric civilization. I believe that the best approach is to take a piece-meal approach towards adoption; take a step, spot the problems, eliminate them and then take another step.” Future Of AI And The Law The law and legal practitioners stand to gain a lot from a proper adoption of AI into the legal system. Legal research is one area that AI has already begun to help out with. AI can streamline the thousands of results an internet or directory search would otherwise provide, offerring a smaller digestible handful of relevant authorities for legal research. This is already proving helpful and with more targeted machine learning it would only get better. The possible benefits go on; automated drafts of documents and contracts, document review, and contract analysis are some of those considered imminent. Many have even considered the possibilities of AI in helping with more administrative functions like the appointment of officers and staff, administration of staff, and making the citizens aware of their legal rights. A future without AI seems bleak and laborious for most industries including the legal and while we must march on, we must be cautious about our strategies for adoption. This point is better put in the words of Joilson Melo; “The possibilities are endless, but the burden of care is very heavy we must act and evolve with cautiously.” Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn .

The funding, which could be worth nearly $1 million depending on how many stores participate, will be used by the state to partner with Axiom Cloud and National Grid to test how an artificial intelligence software platform can provide intelligent forecasting, modeling, and control of refrigeration loads at grocery stores. “The Refrigeration Energy Management project will allow us to target the state’s grocery stores as a valuable source of flexible energy loads while providing crucial energy cost savings for these businesses,” state Energy Commissioner Nicholas Ucci said in a statement. Refrigeration systems are the top users of electricity at supermarkets. Enrollment is on a first-come, first-served basis and is ongoing for National Grid grocery store and supermarket customers in Rhode Island and Massachusetts, the agency said.

Leadership Strategy Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Unfair discrimination is wrong for its own sake and also bad for business. getty We’ve long talked about the “glass ceiling” that prevents women from ascending in the corporate world and elsewhere. There is a new metaphor that smart companies would do well to understand and then vanquish: the “bamboo ceiling.” The Association of Asian American Investment Managers polled 100 investment managers from the community of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. More than 90% of respondents said that the bamboo ceiling (which the report describes as unfair discrimination based on racial stereotypes) has been a problem in their career trajectories. That is one of several disturbing revelations from the poll. To get a handle on this troubling report, I invited six leaders from four countries to comment on it and to offer suggestions for making diversity, equity, and inclusion a reality. Raising awareness is the first step in overcoming bias As a Mexican American, I applaud the Association of Asian American Investment Managers’ report to highlight the obstacles and challenges facing Asian Americans. Raising awareness is proven to be a positive first step in overcoming bias. See, for example, this study from the Brookings Institution. In reading the AAAIM report, I began wondering what blind spots or biases I have toward Asian Americans. That is an essential step in my journey to walk in their shoes. Rafael (Ralph) DeLeon, SVP of Industry Engagement, Ncontracts , U.S. Diverse, equity, and inclusion should be more than buzzwords getty MORE FOR YOU The Next Steps For Companies In Complying With Biden’s Covid Vaccination Mandates Boss To Leader To Steward Leader: Three Stages Of Leadership Maturity Dreamers And Legal Immigration Changes Highlight New House Bill Beware: no quick fixes! I say this from the perspective of a double minority (a Black woman): There is no quick fix to dealing with minorities. There's no blanket “Step 1, 2, 3” instructional guide. It doesn't work like that. We can provide suggestions, but the reality is people have to want to accept change, a change in what they have perceived as normal for years, including working with others who don't look like themselves. Gina Green, Founder and CEO, Tuck9 Ethics, Compliance, and Finance, U.S. It's easy to talk. It's a lot harder to listen. getty “Just as human beings can be guilty of unfair bias, so can AI” One strategy for eliminating the bamboo ceiling would be to empower HR to improve the process of hiring candidates. In some companies, hiring is informed by algorithms grounded in artificial intelligence, which can be embedded with biases based on gender and ethnicity. See, for example, this report in the Harvard Business Review. Just as human beings can be guilty of unfair bias, so can AI. Sabrine Makkes, LLM, Board of Directors member, Women in Ethics & Compliance Global, United Arab Emirates Four diverse voices are better than one. getty “Ethical people want to work for ethical companies” The bamboo ceiling is not just an American phenomenon. It exists on a global scale, not just in the professional arena, but also in politics, education and sports. Inclusive policies in business and beyond not only help minorities in their workforces. These policies also attract the best talent. Ethical people want to work for ethical companies. In the long run it is a win-win for employees and organizations alike. Tonnis J. Poppema, Global Head of Compliance, Nyrstar-Trafigura , The Netherlands Exclusion hurts all. getty “I am aghast but not surprised” After reading the fascinating contents of this report, I am aghast but not surprised by the systemic, pervasive environment of structural discrimination of Asian Americans in the investment management profession today. The entrenched ""old white boys club"" has yet to fully comprehend that it takes more than implementing a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion program to eradicate this blight on the industry. Smart businesses will take the solutions recommended in this report seriously. It is in their own interests to do so. J. Kim Scholes, MBA, SPHR, SHRM-SCP, Director of Human Resources, Aldridge Pite, LLP , U.S.A. Do we have the will to create a better society? getty “All people have something to offer” Our ability to perceive, understand, judge, and act has brought tremendous value to us. However, our innate ability to discriminate works to our own detriment when we fail to view individuals as sovereign beings. It may be a cliché, but it’s true: all people have something to offer. We forget this at our peril. Aaron Jay Dason, Head of Special Projects, Initiatives, and Partnerships, REKA , Malaysia Smiles all around. This doesn't have to be a fantasy. getty Why this is an ethical issue One of the principles of ethical intelligence is Be Fair. To be fair is to give to others their due, and the problem with the bamboo ceiling is that it is a form of unfair discrimination. Discrimination is not inherently wrong. You discriminate when you choose which movie to watch, for example. Your college discriminated by choosing not to admit applicants below a certain grade point average. But denying someone a promotion simply because of their race or gender is unfair. Ethical leadership means, in part, striving to be fair in decisions about who should join the organization, who should advance, and who should be asked to leave. The E word. It matters. getty Now what? Awareness is the first step toward eliminating unfair discrimination, as several leaders noted above. I wasn’t aware that there was such a thing as a bamboo ceiling until I saw the AAAIM report about it. There are lots of ways a company can raise awareness about this and other forms of unfair discrimination. Sharing the report among the leadership and discussing it would be an excellent place to start. It is time to eradicate the bamboo ceiling, and it is never too late to right a wrong. it is in your business's own interest to be diverse. getty Follow me on LinkedIn . Check out my website .

A video recording is embedded below. Slides from the presentation are available here. Presenter Andrew Cox, Senior Lecturer, Information School, University of Sheffield Description The term ‘artificial intelligence’ has many meanings, past and present. In its current guise it has many potential applications in HE. An important aspect of this is the increasing use of data science techniques, such as machine learning, in research across all disciplines: from digital humanities, computational social science through to more obvious applications in the sciences. As data science skills are increasingly in demand in many sectors of the economy so there is an employability driver for it being taught in many disciplines. There are a number of ways academic libraries are already and could in the future be involved in supporting this activity: such as through providing content, licensing proprietary platforms or participating in academic led support communities. This talk presents the options and offers an analysis of which are most likely, drawing on an understanding of the professional knowledge base, balanced with a sense of wider institutional demands.

How to empower women to take up IT careers and stay in them Right to repair: Large scale IT buyers can influence product design... and they should How to stand out in the Inbox: BIMI Explained Technology is a central pillar for modern organisations to grow. However, the rate of our digital acceleration has boosted capital efficiencies at a pace that is quickly becoming unmanageable, and means business have to deploy the right tech, ensuring systems and processes are in place to keep pace. One way to do this is through automation and organizations are taking notice. Australian businesses are well-positioned to remain innovative and competitive, with the Federal Government implementing an AI Action Plan that includes a targeted $124.1 million to aid Australian leadership in developing and adopting responsible Artificial Intelligence (AI). With many businesses setting their sights on AI as key growth driver, decision-makers need to understand the value of emerging technologies, such as AI and Machine Learning (ML), and how to implement them across business strategies rather than a single process. Data is the foundation The modern organisation is made up of a mixture of human and non-human identities. Each user - whether that be an employee or a form of technology that can act independently and make intelligent decisions on behalf of people such as a bot or code – is linked to an identity. Having to manage each individual identity, remember what is linked to each, and know which identity is allowed to know specific information involves a lot of manual processing, and that’s productivity and efficiency down the drain.

We will not share your details with third parties. Many workplaces are already using some form of data collection through AI to streamline these processes, but how can the information go even further to extract valuable insights and help drive informed business decisions? AI and ML can reveal the business blind spots in the cloud Simply put, you can’t stop what you can’t see. As businesses continue to digitally transform with added technology and systems in place, enterprises will become more complex and naturally create more tasks to ensure compliance. The onboarding, managing of users, and review of certifications – it’s time consuming. Pair that with a workforce of hundreds or even thousands, and it quickly becomes impossible. With the help of AI and ML, organisations can make identity more intelligent and autonomous through predictive identity – the idea that user access needs can be anticipated based on an identity profile. Businesses can leverage ML to view historical access data across the organisations to assess its access behaviours and patters. This will set a user activity benchmark and allow users to be categorised into base group models. Behaviours that don’t fit the norm are flagged as potentially malicious and are constantly being watched by AI, removing oftentimes risky needles in a haystack. For example, as new data comes into the engine, AI can assess whether it seems abnormal in relation to what is usually seen across the peer group. Machine learning will filter the standard access and automatically certify an identity if it is deemed safe. A report may be generated to highlight any outliers so immediate action can be taken such as revoking additional access. Excessive access is the enemy of security – how to ensure compliance Staying compliant can be time-consuming and a challenge to maintain, especially if your workforce is made up of full- and part-timers, people working on specific projects or perhaps leaving the organisation. Each of these workers, human or bots, sit in a different circle of trust and consequently expose your organisation to different levels of risk. Compromised credentials are a massive risk that can easily fly under the radar if not monitored and may lead to a major breach that can set you up for compliance violations, with companies who are non-compliant paying an average $14.8 million in fines for failed IT audits. However, by implementing identity security systems powered by AI and ML, organisations can empower their workforce with more (or enhanced) cloud-based tools, while simultaneously protecting the company against evolving cybersecurity threats. An identity security solution will take away the headache and automate the tasks of enforcing and demonstrating compliance through changing employee responsibilities and mitigate any unauthorised access. Additionally, it will help streamline manual-heavy processes, saving staff time to free up space to be more productive on higher-value tasks. By strategically integrating AI and ML along a business’ digital transformation, leaders will be well positioned for growth and security by bringing speed and value to keep up with the rapid pace of digital adoption.

1.76048E+19,Why Artificial Intelligence Research Needs More Women,https://womenlovetech.com/women-artificial-intelligence/,2021-09-19 19:41:15+00:00,2021-09-19 19:41:15+00:00,"Several industries can benefit from having more women, but especially those specifically handling the development and research of <b>machine learning</b> systems. AI&nbsp;...",,"× News Career Reviews Lifestyle Apps Podcasts Technology Privacy Policy Women Love Tech Career Contact About Advertise Terms of Use Why Artificial Intelligence Research Needs More Women Women Love Tech on September 20, 2021 It’s likely no surprise that women are still massively underrepresented in the tech industry today. Even with a push over the last few years for more women to pursue careers in STEM—science, technology, engineering, and mathematics—they still make up a tiny percentage of those working in the field. Data shows that of those doing STEM-focused research around the world, less than 30% are women . Unfortunately, when you narrow the focus down to women working specifically in smart tech and machine learning , the numbers get even smaller. You might wonder why it matters who is behind the data and code creation when it’s essentially a non-gendered machine or robot doing all of the processing, but it does. Machines aren’t inherently biased, but humans are, and when humans are teaching machines how to learn and what to do, our biases naturally become part of the code. Our computers, phones, and any other smart devices that we use today utilize technology that mimics our thought and decision-making processes. So if the majority of people working with smart tech such as artificial intelligence are men, then anything that utilizes AI will skew towards the male perspective. What Is AI and How Are We Using It Today? Though artificial intelligence might bring to mind images of a future world run by robot overlords, it is far less ominous and science fiction-like than that. AI is already a part of so many things that we use and interact with daily—it’s not the future—it’s the present. Though artificial intelligence sounds like a far-fetched term, it is basically the use of algorithms in computer systems to mimic how humans process information, and the more input it receives, the smarter it gets. It’s not just a part of our personal devices either; businesses are using AI to improve customer service and interpret data to further develop their systems and run more efficiently. Google is even leveraging the power of AI to create tools to enhance healthcare and help conservationists and scientists save endangered species and preserve indigenous languages. There is no end to the way we can harness the usefulness of AI. We can apply it to numerous situations to advance our capabilities and solve complex real-world problems. How Will Artificial Intelligence Shape Our Future? Artificial intelligence and deep learning systems are not just likely to change our future; it is already quite evident that they will and are already doing so. As humans, we are limited by our own minds and capabilities. There is only so much we can do—but AI and deep learning machines will allow us to scale our potential and complete tasks, projects, and missions that we would otherwise not be able to do. Deep learning refers to systems with more advanced neural networks that can actually draw conclusions from the input it receives and adapt to changes. In contrast, some more basic and earlier forms of AI machines can only do what they are specifically taught to do. Some examples of deep learning applications include: Facial recognition software Sound recognition software Natural language processing systems Systems that offer recommendations based on user interaction Video game AI So how will deep learning and other advanced forms of AI affect our future? The simple answer is that it will make everything easier and more efficient. As mentioned above, as humans, we can only do so much. We should continue to maintain a human presence and interactions within our business operations—people still need that human touch. But when it comes to interpreting data and solving complex equations to optimise our systems and make new advancements, we need the help of AI. Why Women Are Essential to AI Research Several industries can benefit from having more women, but especially those specifically handling the development and research of machine learning systems. AI is already an integral part of our society and nearly all industries. Our economy and its infrastructure run on many systems that use AI every day. The problem is, when these systems are all designed primarily by men, the processes that the computers use to learn and interpret data will result in a skewed outcome. Mark Minevich, a contributor to Forbes.com, writes , “—organisations will always fail to harness the fullest capacity of their digital innovations without including women, as machine learning technologies will be fed a constant stream of biased data, producing junk results that are not reflective of the full picture, causing potentially catastrophic harm to organisations.” And he’s right. If AI is becoming a significant part of our society and infrastructure, and women will undoubtedly continue to be a part of this society, we need to include them in the research and development of these systems. From transportation and education to media, customer service, and healthcare and wellness —industries are increasingly integrating artificial intelligence into their systems. Without more representation of women, the data these industries work off of and use to improve their operations will be deeply inaccurate. We don’t just need more women researching AI; we must have them. Continuing to leave them out is not an option. It is vital to the growth and success of AI itself and our growth as a society, and our ability to advance. Report by Beau Peters.

Leadership Strategy I write about 21st century leadership, Agile, innovation & narrative. Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Self-organizing team getty Despite horrific daily headlines, the important news is that we are living in a golden age of innovation. It has been called “ the digital age ”, among other names, although that label is wrongly taken to imply that this is just about technology. In reality it’s a combination of both new technology and a radically different kind of management. It is the combination of both—new technology and a new management—that makes things fundamentally different from what was happening in the 20th century. The new digital technologies are amazing—the Internet, the cloud, algorithmic decision making, block chain, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and 3-D printing. Moreover the technologies are evolving rapidly and, as Vivek Wadhwa et al point out in their book, From Incremental To Exponential (Berrett-Koehler, 2020), they are interacting with each other to create even further possibilities. A Revolutionary New Way Of Managing Yet alone, technology doesn’t make much difference. We have learned over the last two decades that few benefits ensue from the new technologies unless there is also a different mindset towards managing—human beings creating value for other human beings. It is a new meta-model of management that is fundamentally different from industrial-era management, which was based on efficiency and outputs. Firms such as Haier and Microsoft , among scores of other firms, have demonstrated the new way, not just in tech, but in cars, finance, health, agriculture, music, movies, retail, restaurants, gaming and hoteling. The new management mindset includes. ·        Embracing a goal of creating value for the customer as the primary foundation of everything the firm does. ·        Unleashing talent in self-organizing teams and micro-enterprises. Talent is now driving strategy , rather than vice versa. MORE FOR YOU The Next Steps For Companies In Complying With Biden’s Covid Vaccination Mandates Boss To Leader To Steward Leader: Three Stages Of Leadership Maturity Dreamers And Legal Immigration Changes Highlight New House Bill ·        Operating as a network of competence , rather than a hierarchy of authority. ·        Enabling a firm to create new businesses , new business models, platforms and ecosystems , and managing data as an asset . And once both technology and management are in place, then dramatic benefits start appearing, along three dimensions. First, the impressive benefits for customers are almost magic, transforming how we work, how we communicate, how we go about, how we shop, how we how we play games, how we deliver health care and education, how we raise our children, how we entertain ourselves, how we read, how we listen to music, how we watch theater, go to the movies, and how we worship: in short how we live. This combination of new technology and new ways of running companies is changing most of our lives, even those in developing countries . Second, it has changes the workplace, potentially for the better. When those doing the work are collaborating in self-organizing teams, focused on delivering value for customers, work can be meaningful and uplifting. At its best, human beings are delivering value for other human beings, as opposed to individuals producing things in accordance with instructions from bosses. Third, it is much more profitable for the firms themselves, once they get fully into this mode. Microsoft is a striking example. It made a commitment to the new way in 2014, under the leadership of CEO—and now chairman—Satya Nadella. Since his taking over and implementing this different way of running a company, Microsoft has added $1.5 trillion to its market capitalization. Is Any Of This Really New? Some critics ask whether there is anything really new in the new way of managing. And indeed,  management innovators have been working on some of these changes for at least a century, beginning with Mary Parker Follett in the 1920s. Yet until recently, there was little enduring success, as Art Kleiner noted in his book, The Age of Heretics (Jossey-Bass, 2008). As Gary Hamel explained last year , “You can go back and read about the precursors of the Agile management, about early attempts at building self-managing teams, about more participatory decision structures. A lot of this work, in the ‘60s and ‘70s, produced extraordinary results—huge gains in productivity and engagement—but few of the changes scaled up. Most of these efforts were ultimately aborted or marginalized. In the end, the empire struck back.” A New Meta-model Of Management Thus, this new meta-model of management isn’t just another variant of 20th century management. True, it is not yet everywhere. But the extraordinary gains being made by firms that have embraced the new meta-model create massive incentives for other firms to make the shift, as well as huge disincentives not to make the shift. What makes Microsoft such a remarkable story is that it is often cited as an example of a stagnant bureaucracy that would never change. Its transformation shows that change is possible. Meanwhile, many big old industrial-era firms are struggling. That’s why it’s dangerous to think of the new age as “the fourth industrial age”, pace Klaus Schwab and his book The Fourth Industrial Revolution (Currency, 2017). If firms think of this as a continuation, or evolution, of the industrial age, they are unlikely to succeed with the new meta-model of management needed for handling digital technologies. A Mass Human Flourishing? Nobel-Prize-winning economist Edmund Phelps has suggested in his book, Mass Flourishing: How Grassroots Innovation Created Jobs, Challenge, and Change (Princeton, 2013), that we could be on the brink of a “Mass Human Flourishing”. And when we see what is happening in the best firms today, it begins to look plausible. But there is also a legitimate concern that we could be on the brink of a Mass Human Repression, if these new technologies were to be used for malign purposes. This is a choice that societies around the world are now facing. Are we heading, as Phelps suggests, towards a Mass Human Flourishing? Or a Mass Human Repression? The choice is ours. But to make that choice, we first have to understand it.

It also made Oxford Languages’ word-of-the-year shortlist then (but lost to “toxic.”) To judge by the amount of negative publicity the companies continue to generate, techlash still is with us — but as far as both markets and users are concerned, it’s an empty word. Every year since at least 2018, Facebook Inc. has led the S&P 500 companies in the number of days it faced negative news sentiment, and Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Twitter Inc. have been in the top 10. (Bloomberg uses supervised machine learning to determine the sentiment in news stories from the point of view of an investor who holds a long position in a stock. The indicator used here is the daily average news sentiment.) Facebook averaged 255 negative news days in 2018 through 2020 and has had more than 150 such days so far this year; Google and Twitter haven’t been far behind. But the ceaseless beating the companies have been taking in the news contrasts with the relentless rise in their stock prices. In 2018 and 2019, Facebook was the S&P company with the most days when its stock price rose despite negative news sentiment. In 2020 and 2021, Google took over the top spot, with Facebook directly behind. You could seemingly publish anything about these companies — their privacy-invading data-gathering practices, their promotion of pernicious political views and anti-vaccine propaganda, their monopoly power. You even could report on enormous fines imposed on the firms by regulators in Europe and the U.S., on lawsuits and antitrust proceedings. Yet nothing would deter investors from buying. Since the start of 2018, Twitter’s market capitalization has increased by a factor of 2.8, Google’s by 2.6 and Facebook’s has doubled. The market cap of the S&P 500, meanwhile, has increased a mere 69% — and these years have been when news sentiment has been consistently worse for the three tech firms than for any of their S&P peers. Arguably, the market has been reacting to the companies’ stellar financials — Google’s net income, for example, has grown by more than 30% a year during this time, and Facebook’s profit growth has averaged more than 40% — rather than to all the negative coverage. Ordinary users, meanwhile, have grown to regard the tech whales as evil. This year’s Edelman Trust Barometer showed the lowest-ever public confidence in technology companies, at 68% compared with 76% in 2017. In the U.S., trust in tech is even lower at 57%. Trust in social media as an information source also is at the lowest level ever. You can’t easily reconcile these trust levels with the user numbers that the tech companies report to investors. Facebook says it has 1.9 billion daily active users, up 460 million since the first quarter of 2018. Twitter has 206 million, up 86 million. And even if the companies exaggerate these hard-to-check numbers by, for instance, not adequately counting users with multiple accounts, the steadily growing profits aren’t, after all, the result of price gouging — that’s not an accusation the Googles and Facebooks of this world have faced, yet. Instead, they reflect advertisers’ continued reliance on them, a reliance that would not be there if the ads didn’t convert to sales. If users really considered the tech leaders evil, they’d abandon them in droves. Sure, network effects are hard to overcome, as my Bloomberg Opinion colleague Parmy Olson recently wrote, using the example of Facebook’s WhatsApp messenger — it appeared to bleed users after a change in privacy standards but ended up showing exemplary resilience. The power of these effects can be frightening: A U.S. government ban on Huawei’s use of Google software has all but killed the Chinese company’s then-market leading Android phone business, driving a high-quality hardware producer into a ditch because most users couldn’t imagine a Google-free life. And yet viable alternatives do exist, even in heavily monopolized areas such as internet search, not to mention mobile messaging. It’s just that the household names aren’t really any less attractive for most people than these alternatives. They aren’t evil enough for the daily user to go to any trouble at all. When regulators take action against Big Tech, they understandably react to media reports — that barrage of negative news sentiment. The media, however, are Big Tech’s direct competitors in battles for audience attention and advertising dollars. I’d argue that we journalists are naturally motivated to consider Google, Facebook and even Twitter evil, no matter how objective we try to appear. I’ll be the first to admit that I’m biased in my thinking about them: These companies have all but ruined the professional world and the industry in which I started out and which I came to understand and love. Most officials and politicians grew up in my world, too; to them, reacting to sustained media sentiment like the kind that has developed around Big Tech is a matter of long practice. Yet when it comes to ordinary users, the professional media are yet another increasingly unreliable source. We may gloat about the falling trust in social media, but the same Edelman Trust Barometer shows the lowest confidence in traditional media since at least 2012 — 53% globally, down from 63% in 2018, at the beginning of “techlash.” And 59% of respondents say journalists intentionally mislead them and that they are more interested in pushing ideologies than in reporting facts. With majorities feeling that way, no wonder people don’t attach much importance to media attacks on tech. To give a recent example, ProPublica, the nonprofit organization that promotes investigative journalism, has revealed the little-known fact that contract workers check not just the messages reported by users as pernicious but also those that came immediately before them. Rather than deny this practice, Facebook has said it’s normal to examine the context when complaints are made, and that doing so doesn’t undermine the privacy protections accorded by end-to-end encryption. As a journalist, I’m inclined to side with ProPublica — but to everyday users, even if they take notice of the controversy at all, it pits one relatively untrustworthy source against another. Given the news climate and regulators’ behavior, tech companies are, of course, among the biggest lobbying spenders. According to OpenSecrets, Facebook spent $19.7 million last year and $9.6 million so far this year on lobbying. But these amounts are tiny given the scale of its operations. If techlash were real, they would be woefully insufficient to defend the social networking giant from popular anger. As it is, the media will keep chipping away at tech power, and regulators will bite, sometimes painfully. But they will not undo the highly questionable business models that sustain digital advertising leaders; users just don’t care enough for a tech counterrevolution to break out. I’m in constant search of alternatives to the tech giants’ services. I’ve replaced them everywhere I could, and I’ll replace the services I’m still using as soon as comparable alternatives become available. Yet I have no illusions about people like me undermining Big Tech’s market power in any meaningful way. There are enough of us to keep its smaller competitors alive, but that’s the extent of it. Techlash, let’s face it, is a niche phenomenon. Leonid Bershidsky is a member of the Bloomberg News Automation team based in Berlin. He was previously Bloomberg Opinion’s Europe columnist.

BROOKINGS INSTITUTION Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save Emilie Heidemann Madison has boosted its potential to become an artificial intelligence powerhouse over the last decade because of research activity, according to a new report from Washington D.C.-based think tank Brookings Institution . But the report also suggests that in order to keep up with the country’s emergent AI industry, Madison business leaders should forge more corporate research partnerships with UW-Madison . That would further boost the use of AI, promote entrepreneurship and encourage local job retention and attraction. “Significant money is flowing into the region to support almost exclusive contracts or research and development initiatives,” explained Mark Muro, Brookings senior fellow and report co-author. “That’s very important in itself. At the same time, because federal research done at UW-Madison is also building a talent base of skilled researchers and graduate students, there’s a pipeline for future AI expansion.” “(AI) technologies can be applied in a myriad of industries, and are widely presumed to likely drive major productivity gains,” Muro added. For the report, Muro and his team used seven metrics to assess the research capabilities and commercialization activities of 385 metropolitan areas in the United States. The metrics sorted each area into one of five categories. The report indicates that the San Francisco Bay Area in California is in a “superstar” league of its own because it scored high in all areas. That’s largely because the Bay Area relies on investment from both public and private efforts and is home to the top universities for AI research, including Stanford and University of California-Berkeley , as well as tech giants like Facebook and Google . Beyond that, 13 metro areas showed “above-average involvement” in AI activities and were placed into an “early adopter” category. The regions, Muro said, possess strong research institutions. But they’ve also been successful in developing and deploying commercial applications from that research, he said. Those communities also benefit from hosting leaders like Amazon , Oracle and IBM. A Brookings Institution graph indicates where Madison falls in the adoption of AI technologies. BROOKINGS INSTITUTION The regions, including Madison and 20 others, that lacked companies commercializing AI were put into the “federal research and contracting centers” category. In addition, there were 90 communities that demonstrated potential for adopting AI. The remaining 261 had little to no AI activity, Muro said. Even though Madison has yet to gain “early adopter” status, Muro said he is optimistic that will happen within the next decade. He said the region is a “social ecosystem” that has found its dynamic niche in the tech sector. And why not? There are some local business leaders and UW-Madison faculty members who agree with that sentiment. “The opportunity (to expand AI) is on the horizon, but there is work to be done,” said Zach Brandon, Greater Madison Chamber of Commerce president. “AI is the future and there is no running from it.” Madison’s DataChat is a newer example of AI commercialization, Brandon said. CEO Jignesh Patel, a UW-Madison computer science professor, just secured a $25 million Series A investment round for the startup, which uses artificial intelligence to make analytics accessible to all. That’s on top of the $4 million in financing DataChat received last year. The money will help build on DataChat’s product vision, and allow the startup to expand its staff, Patel said. But what Muro calls Madison’s “legacy” industries are embracing AI, too. For instance, American Family Insura nce , headquartered at 5599 American Family Drive on Madison’s East Side, gave UW-Madison $20 million in 2019 to start the American Family Insurance Data Science Institute. That partnership has helped attract some talent, including interns, said American Family machine learning and emergent technologist Glenn Fung. A Brookings Institution chart describes the five categories each metropolitan area falls under in terms of AI tech adoption. BROOKINGS INSTITUTION In addition, the Creative Destruction Lab at UW-Madison leverages the knowledge of the Wisconsin School of Business , and the newly formed School of Computing, Data and Information Sciences , to seed tech entrepreneurship, said Daniel Bauer, director of the UW-Madison Business School’s Master’s program in business analytics. Through a partnership with American Family, Fung said, the Lab offers what’s called a “risk stream” that supports ventures helping society manage risk. Think an AI model to drive improved decision making. Becoming a hub But in order to fully reach “AI hub” status, Muro said some people might have to overcome their fears of a dystopian AI future. “Some fear it will replace quality jobs and we know that automation is changing who does that kind of work,” Muro said. Instead, the way forward will be understanding how AI can “accelerate growth across a variety of industries,” he said, as well as foster greater market share and hiring. Helping that along could be a bill that has recently passed the U.S. Senate, Brandon said, titled the United States Innovation and Competition Act of 2021, which would prompt the commercialization of AI and other tech nationally, among other directives. Otherwise, there might be a “winner-take-all” scenario, in which some metro areas have economic advantages over others, Muro said. Reset, restart: Madison-area businesses embrace new reality To survive, business owners know they need to be prepared for what’s next. It’s safe to say most weren’t prepared for the cataclysm of the last year. Yet, most adapted. From reducing hours and adding curbside pickup or outdoor seating to changing product lines, finding new suppliers and moving their operations online, companies reinvented themselves. Some of those changes were temporary; others will alter the face of Madison’s business community for years to come.

Education Italy, ideal destination for students Italy, ideal destination for students By Telangana Today Published: 19th Sep 2021 11:57 pm Share WhatsApp Facebook Twitter Telegram Email By Ajaya Kumar Vemulapati - Advertisement - The educational horizons of the new generation in India have widened considerably. It is exciting to note the rising percentage of young students who are choosing to study abroad and leave their mark at international universities. Southern Europe has become a particularly popular destination for these students with its rich cultural history and exceptional universities. Italy is one such nation that is proving to be a boon for international students. From the Alps in the North to the beaches in the South, there is no dearth of natural wonders in the country. Because of its cosmopolitan atmosphere and diverse culture, studying in Italy will offer youngsters an opportunity to widen their perspectives and truly become global citizens. Hyderabad News Hyderabad-based firm develops companion robots to keep elderly engaged Laddus go for hefty amounts in Hyderabad More rain in store for Hyderabad click here for more Hyderabad News Established in 1902, Bocconi University, a private institution in the heart of Milan is an attractive option for those interested in business, management, or the humanities fields. The president of the university is Mario Monti, an Italian economist who was the Prime Minister of Italy from 2011-13, and the rector is Gianmario Verona, an established scholar himself. Bocconi’s school of business management also has an excellent Asia Centre in Mumbai, which extends the global nature of the programme. Milan is an incredible city to live in, known for its fashion, food and architectural delights. It’s especially wonderful for students with many esteemed universities in town, there’s a huge variety of student events and affordable places to go. The Bocconi campus is fully integrated into bustling urban life. It’s just 10 minutes of walking away from downtown Milan and about 20 minutes from the jewel of the city, Duomo de Milan — the famous cathedral church of Milan that is a historical wonder of its own right. Bocconi University’s Social Sciences faculty is of the highest quality. There are numerous interesting courses that blend economic thinking and real-life application such as ‘Economics and Management for Arts, Culture and Communication’ and ‘Economics and Management of Innovation and Technology. The MBA programmes are also highly renowned and the recently added Masters in Data Science and Business Analytics holds much promise. Professors in Bocconi are extremely respected and many seminal textbooks and concepts have originated from faculty at this institution. The university boasts of 20 permanent research centres, with 200 international and over 300 national publications yearly. The student to teacher ratio is maintained at 9:1. Tuition costs about 12,000-14000 euros a year but Bocconi regularly awards merit scholarships for both their Bachelor’s and Master’s courses. Living costs would usually amount to 1000 euros a month, and there are opportunities for jobs on campus as a research or teaching assistant. Of course, a study permit in Italy also allows students to work part-time, for up to 20 hours a week, outside of campus. Indian students are slowly waking up to the excellent educational possibilities in Italy and making their way to universities like Bocconi. About 20% of the student demographic is international and to ensure that foreign students settle in smoothly and understand Italian conventions, the university offers seminar sessions on everything from taxation to enrolling into the public healthcare system. Most courses are offered in both English and it is mandatory for international students to learn Italian to encourage cultural integration. There are a variety of social and extracurricular options with clubs based around topics such as business, investments, sports, wine, and chess — to name a few. The university is especially exciting for anyone interested in athletic endeavours. The recently inaugurated Sports Campus houses state-of-the-art facilities: notably, a 50m Olympic swimming pool, two basketball courts which have been used by professional Milan basketball teams for practice, a well-equipped gym, and a futsal ground. Emma Twigg, the recent Olympic rowing gold medallist is an alumna of Bocconi and so is the retired footballer Clarence Seedorf. The university focuses on giving its students hands-on experience whenever possible. There are regular seminars with professionals and individual counselling services available, and an online portal notifying students of various job and internship opportunities. Top recruiters come from all industries including tech, management consultancy, fashion and beauty, and investment banking. Over 94% of Bocconi graduates locate a job through the university or find themselves in another respected academic programme. Bocconi has an international reputation as a leader in the fields of economics, management, finance, political science, data science and legal studies with a rank in the top 20 of the QS World Ranking 2021. Studying in Italy would be a unique and gratifying experience for Indian students: while it has all first-world conveniences and development, Italy never loses out on its millennia of culture and heritage.

Here's a look at the workflow playing field and where vendors like Zoom fit in. By Larry Dignan for Between the Lines | September 19, 2021 -- 22:00 GMT (06:00 SGT) | Topic: Collaboration Workflow is becoming the buzzword of 2021 for a broad range of software and cloud giants as collaboration, hybrid work, automation and task management all collide. Based on transcripts from earnings calls and analyst events it's clear that workflow is bubbling up as a technological term. ServiceNow, which built a juggernaut on delivering workflow automation and popularized it, mentioned ""workflow"" 32 times on its most recent earnings call . ServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott noted that customers are buying workflow infrastructure for IT, customers, employees and creators. And for what it's worth, ServiceNow essentially started the slow-moving workflow bandwagon. During its 2013 analyst meeting, ServiceNow executives mentioned workflow 35 times as they laid out the case that the company could expand beyond IT service management. Salesforce on its second-quarter earnings call covered the term workflow twice in depth. Bret Taylor, president and chief operating officer at Salesforce, said: ""IBM is one of my favorite examples of a Slack-First Customer 360 company. IBM has built their entire Customer 360 on Salesforce. Over 530,000 customers, 380,000 employees and 50,000 partners using our platform. And all of these employees are working in Slack. They've connected their workflows across Sales Cloud, across Service Cloud and enables them to connect and take action from anywhere."" Zoom executives during their Zoomtopia analyst day covered workflow tools and strategies four times. Microsoft also talked about its role in enabling workflows twice on its most recent earnings call. Atlassian also talked about automated workflows in relation to Jira . ""The best thing we can do is be deeply integrated in all of those places. We believe that's best for the customers. It is then our job to automate workflows, to coordinate data and to do that the best we can across all of those different applications,"" said Atlassian co-CEO Michael Cannon-Brookes. If this workflow-meets-messaging and collaboration apps vibe sounds familiar that's because it is the next enterprise software battleground. As work goes hybrid and automates, workflow engines that operate within collaborative apps (essentially the digital office these days) will be critical. That vision is why Salesforce bought Slack and is now integrating ahead of its Dreamforce conference. It's also why ServiceNow's latest Now Platform release has a heavy dose of automated workflows and integrations with Microsoft Teams. And it's why Zoom at Zoomtopia spent a lot of time talking about workflows and how it can integrate with video meetings and collaboration. How will this workflow war play out? Here's a crib sheet of the landscape today and how it'll evolve. ServiceNow-Microsoft vs. Salesforce-Slack. If this were a professional wrestling match, ServiceNow-Microsoft vs. Salesforce-Slack would be the lead tag team battle. I'll spare you the Photoshop putting ServiceNow Bill McDermott and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff in wrestling gear largely because I did it a few years ago. But I digress. Ultimately, the ServiceNow-Microsoft vs. Salesforce-Slack is about automating work within the collaboration. Think about bringing services into collaboration tools. What remains to be seen is whether ServiceNow and Salesforce collide directly. ServiceNow is focused on more backend processes such as resolving issues, answering questions, fixing broken things and streamlining approvals . Salesforce is more of a front-end workflow play with Customer 360, CRM, customer service and sales and bringing insights into tools like Slack. Collaboration moves into workflows. Zoom may be ahead of the workflow meets collaboration game, but at Zoomtopia the company's video-centric approach to workflow is telling. Zoom is building industry-specific templates and bringing in apps to its platforms to meet employees where they are. Zoom unveils first group of app investments as part of $100 million global venture fund Zoom announces general availability of Zoom Apps and its new virtual events platform Oded Gal, chief product officer at Zoom, said at Zoomtopia: A little less than 2 months ago, we announced Zoom Apps . Zoom Apps consists of over 50 launch partners with apps that you can use in the Zoom Meeting today. They are already some of the most popular of the 1,500-plus third-party integrations in the Zoom App Marketplace and include integrations with HubSpot, DocuSign, Google Suite, Microsoft Office and more. Gal cited DocuSign integration as a strong workflow example. You can see here the workflow really integrates the ability to sign a document while you're in a video meeting. And Graeme Geddes, head of Zoom Phone, said at Zoomtopia: We've seen a tremendous level of interest and adoption from Zoom Rooms from our customers as it's been central to their own return-to-office strategies. Over the past year, we've leveraged the power of Zoom Rooms to help our customers build new spaces and workflows to support a new, hybrid way of working. We introduced a number of capabilities, for example, if we go to the next slide, kiosk mode to support virtual receptionists; people counting and voice commands to support corporate safety standards and social distancing practices; and Smart Gallery. With Zoom talking about workflows and integrations with enterprise app players, rest assured that other video collaboration vendors are going to follow suit. For what it's worth, Cisco's most recent earnings conference call didn't surface workflows in reference to WebEx. The rest of the field and workflow washing. Cloud The top cloud providers What is cloud computing? Everything you need to know The best cloud storage services OneDrive tips and tricks: How to master Microsoft's free cloud storage Once this workflow theme gains more traction you can rest assured other technology vendors will pile on. We've seen the buzzword bingo before so get ready for ""cloud-enabled blockchain quantum AI and machine learning powered workflow automation"" headlines any day now.

Image credit: PepsiCo Related tags: Pepsico , pepviz PepsiCo has unveiled a new data platform dubbed ‘pepviz’ enabling it to collaborate with retail partners to develop a more granular, targeted, and ‘hyperlocal’ approach to product assortment, digital marketing and inventory management that has already delivered measurable results. A proprietary data practice developed by PepsiCo combining consumer insights, advanced analytics, data science and industry expertise, pepviz ​ ​is proving particularly valuable in an omnichannel environment in which retailers are trying to find the right products and pack sizes, messages, and promotions to meet shoppers where they are, whether that’s online or in store, SVP at PepsiCo North America Kate Garner told FoodNavigator-USA. 'We were able to customize the shelf set for shoppers in store, while enabling the demand [for multipacks] to be fulfilled through the back door' ​ In one collaboration deploying pepviz, PepsiCo worked with a large retailer to compare sales performance, e-commerce sales mix, and shelf space across stores. PepsiCo then identified stores with the highest potential for e-commerce sales growth that needed additional holding capacity for Frito-Lay multipacks in the store backroom, which instore shoppers are less likely to purchase, but click and collect shoppers over-index on, said Garner. Stores in the test saw their salty category sales outpace those in stores not in the test, she said. “ We said, we know the demand is there for that ​[multipack] inventory, but it doesn't have to be on shelves, because what shoppers walking through the store are looking for is a different assortment set ​ [vs the click & collect shopper]. So we were able to customize that shelf set for that shopper in store, while enabling the demand to be fulfilled through the back door.” ​ 'We were able to come in and deliver planograms on a store by store basis to deliver growth' ​ In another case study, PepsiCo worked with two national retailers with small store formats. By looking at shoppers’ buying patterns and behaviors, each of the retailers was able to sort its customers into four clusters—each assigned its own salty snack product mix. One chain saw sales in the salty snack segment grow by $4,000 per store per year, while the other saw growth of nearly $1,300 per store per year, with both now planning to expand this approach, said Garner. “ We were able to come in and deliver planograms on a store by store basis to deliver growth.” ​ 'A much more granular approach to their assortment process' ​ In one collaboration, she said, “ We saw an opportunity for a partner to further its better for you assortment and the retailer was uncertain about that; it weren't sure that its shopper had an interest in that. And we agreed that it probably wasn't universal, but we felt there was niche but untapped opportunity. ​ “We started with a select set of stores – so it was low risk and low investment, a small piece of the footprint - and our ability to demonstrate growth in that area led to a much more granular approach to the assortment process across the board.” ​ More targeted digital click & collect coupons In a final example, a large supermarket chain leveraged pepviz to better understand the impact of school closures, changes to SNAP benefits and other COVID-19-inspired factors on their shoppers to help drive more targeted digital click & collect coupons, said Garner. ' ​How do we use data to be more predictive?' ​ Like all major CPG brands that serve as category leaders, PepsiCo has been analyzing data to help key customers maximize sales for years, said Garner. But pepviz takes this to a more granular level. “We have been going down the data path for a number of years, but one of the things that we've learned in the last 18 months is the agility that this data provides, so we can work with our retail partners and further advance those strategic relationships. ​ “We’ve also learned that looking back is not an indicator of what's happening today or tomorrow, so how do we use data to be more predictive? Our category team is using this on a daily basis to work with retailer partners.” ​ 'Oftentimes what can be most difficult to see is what's not ​ happening in your store' Asked about what data sources PepsiCo is mining to feed into its pepviz platform, she said: “It's a broad set of third party, second party as well as first party data."" ​ In a nutshell, she said, "" Where we see opportunity in partnership with our retailers, is that they go very deep on what's inside their box, whereas our data looks right across the marketplace, and oftentimes what can be most difficult to see is what's not ​ happening in your store.” ​ Image credits: PepsiCo Copyright - Unless otherwise stated all contents of this web site are © 2021 - William Reed Business Media Ltd - All Rights Reserved - Full details for the use of materials on this site can be found in the Terms & Conditions Related topics: Snacks , Beverage , People , Food retail and e-commerce , Manufacturers , Markets Subscribe to our FREE newsletter Subscribe Follow us Products View more Virginia Dare Extract Co Inc |                 Download                                     Technical / White Paper Solve Taste Challenges in Keto Husky Injection Molding Systems Ltd. |                 Download                                     Insight Guide Food & CPG Packaging Systems: 4 Questions to Ask Cargill |                 Download                                     Technical / White Paper Plant-based proteins revolutionizing convenience Lallemand Bio-Ingredients |                 Download                                     Technical / White Paper Our natural ingredients providing umami & kokumi Nexira Inc. |                 Download                                     Technical / White Paper Natural Acerola Extract For Food Protection Oracle NetSuite |                 Download                                     Technical / White Paper Your Complete Guide to Inventory Forecasting Webinars Upcoming supplier webinars 21 Sep 2021 Tue 5 Things You Need to Know About Fruit and Vegetable Servings 07 Oct 2021 Thu The Benefits of Using Membranes in the Production of Plant Proteins On-demand webinars Digitalization and the Future of Data Collection in Modern R&D and QC What’s Next for Sustainable Agriculture?

Understand Are artificial intelligence and machine learning the same thing?  Understand cpadmin September 19, 2021 43 Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML machine learning ) are two popular and frequently used terms nowadays for the development of intelligent systems.  Although these are two related technologies, people often use one synonymously with the other, but they are not the same thing. Do you know what machine learning is?  Understand everything about this technology Glossary Artificial Intelligence: Understand the main terms used in the area Neuroscience, artificial intelligence and data that are not in Big Data Na In practice, all machine learning is artificial intelligence, but not all artificial intelligence is machine learning.  AI is a field of computer science capable of creating a computer system that can mimic human intelligence, and artificial intelligence systems use algorithms to work on their own reasoning. Machine learning, on the other hand, is a subfield of artificial intelligence that allows robots to learn from data or previous experiences without having to be programmed for a particular task.  ML gives the computer the ability to learn by itself, based on training models, to assess its performance and make predictions. Want to catch up on the best tech news of the day? Access and subscribe to our new channel on youtube, Canaltech News. Every day a summary of the main news from the tech world for you! Smart machines Industrial robots are good examples of AI as they have the ability to monitor their own accuracy and performance.  While doing so, they can sense or detect when maintenance is needed to avoid downtime, working in new and unfamiliar environments, without the need for pre-programming. Personal assistants like Google Home, Siri, Alexa and Cortana also show how artificial intelligence can help in the interaction between humans and machines.  They allow users to find information, book hotels, add events to calendars, answer questions, schedule meetings or send messages in an almost intuitive way. Virtual assistants use AI to talk to owners (Image: Twenty68photos/Envato) In the automotive industry, artificial intelligence is used to assist the driver with information about vehicle problems, fuel consumption, monitoring blind spots and other factors.  In projects of completely autonomous cars, sensors, processors and convolutional networks help in decision-making, detecting pedestrians and other vehicles to ensure safe driving. Learning from experiences Most e-commerce sites have machine learning tools that provide recommendations for different products with based on users’ search history.  For example, if you search for cookbooks at an online store and purchase one of them, when you return to the site, the homepage will show a list of books related to the topic previously searched. Online stores use machine learning to “guess” customer tastes (Image: Rido81/Envato) The machine learning engine also makes recommendations based on what you liked, added to your cart and other related features to try to learn from human behavior.  This training generates immediate responses, based on previous actions that were “memorized” in the database of the computer programs learning system. Nowadays, most of the services of email uses machine learning tools to automatically learn and identify spam and phishing attempts.  These smart filters go beyond pre-existing rules, generating new checkers based on user behavior. “ML systems are based on three points: a task to be performed , a set of data about this task and, finally, a statistical measure that tells how well that system performs the proposed work.  So, for an algorithm to be classified as ML, it is expected that, by carrying out the tasks on the experiences, it will have its quality metrics optimized”, explains AI specialist Douglas Amorim de Oliveira. Brains of the future Artificial intelligence is important for the development of new technologies because it forms the basis of computer learning.  Through AI, machines have been able to harness large amounts of data and use what they’ve learned to make more accurate future decisions. Autonomous cars will combine artificial intelligence and machine learning to ensure safer travel (Image: Rawpixel/Envato) Algorithm-based systems are becoming responsible by new and increasingly comprehensive technological approaches.  Medical breakthroughs in cancer research and even cutting-edge studies on climate change mix machine learning with other artificial intelligences to build more efficient models and equipment. Both artificial intelligence how much machine learning went from being an invention of fiction to becoming reality.  Robots that could think like humans were an excellent plot for a gripping story.  Now, they are part of the daily lives of thousands of people on their smartphones, tablets and virtual assistants. “The trend is that these two technologies become increasingly popular and permeate our everyday lives.  Both ML and AI are used today when we travel helping to optimize routes or help in various areas such as medicine, agribusiness, marketing and financial markets.  We are living through a great revolution that is just beginning”, highlights Oliveira. Did you like this article?

The report is based on 26 skills in the business, technology, and data science domains. Each industry reported an acceleration in the need for technology skills to account for – at a minimum – the lack of physical interaction induced by the pandemic. These are changes appear unlikely to recede as the pandemic does; instead, companies will continue to move forward with digitalisation at an accelerated pace, Coursera said. “The rate of digital transformation due to pandemic lockdowns was substantial. Microsoft data shows that two years’ worth of transformation was concentrated into two months. And in the last weeks of March 2020, for example, there was as much broadband growth as some experts expected for the entire year,” Coursera said. “Across industries, businesses are evolving despite the unplanned change to remote work requirements, and increased broadband use is just one indicator.” 149 million new jobs To maintain the transformation velocity, specific technology and data skills are needed across industries—namely cloud computing, cybersecurity, data analysis, and software development, Coursera said. Adding workers with these skills will fuel growth, and it’s anticipated that by 2025 there will be 149 million new digital jobs focused on these skills, it said. “Currently, our analysis of trending skills in the technology and data science domains shows that people are highly interested in learning software engineering and data analysis skills. Many of the trending skills in those domains can also be applied to cloud computing and cybersecurity; however, we expect to see an increase in interest for those specific skill sets as well.” While technology and data science skills are critical, on their own, they aren’t enough to achieve proficiency for the new world of digital work, Coursera said. Because of this, the group also tracked trending skills in the business domain as workers will need a combination of technology skills, business enablers, and durable human skills to be most effective in a digital economy. These skills are outlined in more detail below.

BROOKINGS INSTITUTION Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save Emilie Heidemann Madison has boosted its potential to become an artificial intelligence powerhouse over the last decade because of research activity, according to a new report from Washington D.C.-based think tank Brookings Institution . But the report also suggests that in order to keep up with the country’s emergent AI industry, Madison business leaders should forge more corporate research partnerships with UW-Madison . That would further boost the use of AI, promote entrepreneurship and encourage local job retention and attraction. “Significant money is flowing into the region to support almost exclusive contracts or research and development initiatives,” explained Mark Muro, Brookings senior fellow and report co-author. “That’s very important in itself. At the same time, because federal research done at UW-Madison is also building a talent base of skilled researchers and graduate students, there’s a pipeline for future AI expansion.” “(AI) technologies can be applied in a myriad of industries, and are widely presumed to likely drive major productivity gains,” Muro added. For the report, Muro and his team used seven metrics to assess the research capabilities and commercialization activities of 385 metropolitan areas in the United States. The metrics sorted each area into one of five categories. The report indicates that the San Francisco Bay Area in California is in a “superstar” league of its own because it scored high in all areas. That’s largely because the Bay Area relies on investment from both public and private efforts and is home to the top universities for AI research, including Stanford and University of California-Berkeley , as well as tech giants like Facebook and Google . Beyond that, 13 metro areas showed “above-average involvement” in AI activities and were placed into an “early adopter” category. The regions, Muro said, possess strong research institutions. But they’ve also been successful in developing and deploying commercial applications from that research, he said. Those communities also benefit from hosting leaders like Amazon , Oracle and IBM. A Brookings Institution graph indicates where Madison falls in the adoption of AI technologies. BROOKINGS INSTITUTION The regions, including Madison and 20 others, that lacked companies commercializing AI were put into the “federal research and contracting centers” category. In addition, there were 90 communities that demonstrated potential for adopting AI. The remaining 261 had little to no AI activity, Muro said. Even though Madison has yet to gain “early adopter” status, Muro said he is optimistic that will happen within the next decade. He said the region is a “social ecosystem” that has found its dynamic niche in the tech sector. And why not? There are some local business leaders and UW-Madison faculty members who agree with that sentiment. “The opportunity (to expand AI) is on the horizon, but there is work to be done,” said Zach Brandon, Greater Madison Chamber of Commerce president. “AI is the future and there is no running from it.” Madison’s DataChat is a newer example of AI commercialization, Brandon said. CEO Jignesh Patel, a UW-Madison computer science professor, just secured a $25 million Series A investment round for the startup, which uses artificial intelligence to make analytics accessible to all. That’s on top of the $4 million in financing DataChat received last year. The money will help build on DataChat’s product vision, and allow the startup to expand its staff, Patel said. But what Muro calls Madison’s “legacy” industries are embracing AI, too. For instance, American Family Insura nce , headquartered at 5599 American Family Drive on Madison’s East Side, gave UW-Madison $20 million in 2019 to start the American Family Insurance Data Science Institute. That partnership has helped attract some talent, including interns, said American Family machine learning and emergent technologist Glenn Fung. A Brookings Institution chart describes the five categories each metropolitan area falls under in terms of AI tech adoption. BROOKINGS INSTITUTION In addition, the Creative Destruction Lab at UW-Madison leverages the knowledge of the Wisconsin School of Business , and the newly formed School of Computing, Data and Information Sciences , to seed tech entrepreneurship, said Daniel Bauer, director of the UW-Madison Business School’s Master’s program in business analytics. Through a partnership with American Family, Fung said, the Lab offers what’s called a “risk stream” that supports ventures helping society manage risk. Think an AI model to drive improved decision making. Becoming a hub But in order to fully reach “AI hub” status, Muro said some people might have to overcome their fears of a dystopian AI future. “Some fear it will replace quality jobs and we know that automation is changing who does that kind of work,” Muro said. Instead, the way forward will be understanding how AI can “accelerate growth across a variety of industries,” he said, as well as foster greater market share and hiring. Helping that along could be a bill that has recently passed the U.S. Senate, Brandon said, titled the United States Innovation and Competition Act of 2021, which would prompt the commercialization of AI and other tech nationally, among other directives. Otherwise, there might be a “winner-take-all” scenario, in which some metro areas have economic advantages over others, Muro said.

Updated: 19 Sep 2021, 11:50 PM IST Neetu Chandra Sharma Navdeep Manaktala talks about the emergence of healthcare startups and how they helped tackle the pandemic Read Full Story Listen to this article Covid-19 has driven massive acceleration in digital transformation across sectors and boosted the adoption of digital services by consumers, besides creating new opportunities for agile startups, Navdeep Manaktala, director and head, startup business, Asia-Pacific and Japan, Amazon Web Services (AWS), said in an interview. Manaktala shared his views on the emergence of healthcare startups and how they helped tackle the pandemic. Edited excerpts: The pandemic has accelerated the digitization of health-tech startups. What is your take on it? MORE FROM THIS SECTION See All Premium Premium Advent to buy Eureka Forbes paying $600 million to Shap .... Premium Premium ‘At EaseMyTrip, we are glad to be completely bootstrapped’ Premium Premium Dish TV to defer AGM to seek clearance for board changes Premium Premium Revised fare caps may lower ticket prices, boost sales We see particular demand for better and easier access to healthcare in these times, and, in fact, health-tech is one of the fastest-growing verticals across the Asia-Pacific. In March 2020, the government announced telemedicine guidelines during the nationwide lockdown, and state-owned teleconsultation portal eSanjeevani is setting high records. Regulatory interventions provided an additional impetus to healthcare digitization, and leading health-tech startups reported a three to five times increase in patient traffic within just six months of the onset of the pandemic. Sectors that led the way were telemedicine, e-pharmacy, and e-diagnostic solutions for at-home sample collections. The covid-led lockdowns forced patients to place their trust in healthcare digitization, and they realized the convenience it offers. The growth is also translating into consolidation and the entry of major players into this space, and you see this play out in acquisition deals, such as Tata Digital’s decision to buy out 1mg, PharmEasy’s acquisition of Medlife, and Reliance Retail Ventures’ acquisition of Netmeds. Digitization will further increase among healthcare technology providers, including health-tech startups, with the adoption of the National Digital Health Mission (NDHM). Today, patient data is stored in silos across healthcare stakeholders such as hospitals and diagnostic labs. NDHM provides a fabric for healthcare data interoperability, enabling patients to store, access and share standardized digital health records with all stakeholders and receive seamless care and faster insurance claim settlements. This patient-consent based open digital infrastructure will pave the way for startups to build patient-focused innovations on top of NDHM, such as personalized tips for chronic care management or building machine learning models using anonymized patient data. Our digital healthcare partner, KareXpert, manages over one million electronic patient records for 25 healthcare providers across India through its software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform, and they already have a cloud-native NDHM-ready stack running on AWS. Startups reduced the impact of the covid-19 second wave on India’s healthcare infrastructure with innovative solutions for diagnostics, patient care and vaccination drives. Preventive care gained importance due to the increasing cost of healthcare. How can startups build on AWS to offer a solution? As per the World Health Organization, India’s out-of-pocket healthcare expenses from an individual’s personal savings stands at around 62% versus 18% globally. The high cost of healthcare and a change in mindset towards staying fit and monitoring health closely are an impetus to preventive healthcare. Startups are using innovative business models to tap into this mindset change. Online fitness classes are emerging as a big use case due to the pandemic. MINT PREMIUM See All Premium How  India’s entry in global bond indices will help Premium Telecom package: Kicking the can down the road? Premium How non-resident Indians can buy term life insurance in India Premium Spike in compliance costs may hit tech startups hard Startups leverage AWS here for content delivery, where fitness videos and other content are stored on AWS Edge locations across India and delivered to consumers securely and at high speeds. For instance, Cult.fit’s live classes spiked 30 times the usual volume within a week of the pandemic-induced lockdown. Within three weeks, the app was re-architected on AWS to support 300,000 concurrent users in a class, using AWS Media services and Amazon CloudFront. Cult.fit also uses machine learning models trained on Amazon EC2 P3 instances to aid in tracking user movement during exercises, display how accurately users are performing the exercises, and calculate how much energy they are burning. Can technologies such as remote patient monitoring and telemedicine help solve issues related to inadequate healthcare infrastructure in remote areas? Startups are driven to solve problems that were never solved before and address challenging structural gaps in day-to-day life. They do this by applying technology to create new access and new business models, and they are not constrained by traditional practices. Remote patient monitoring (RPM) uses sensors to monitor a patient’s vitals remotely and raise the alarm in case of any deterioration. We have seen Indian startups using RPM to manage chronic conditions such as diabetes and asthma, with connected devices to capture data, and using a personalized mobile app to show progress, set pill reminders, book appointments and generate alarms.During covid, RPM became all the more useful due to an acute shortage of staff and the risk of infection from in-person contact with covid-19 patients. AWS customer Dozee provides remote patient monitoring devices to over 230 hospitals, addressing the shortage of nurses in India. Using Dozee’s contactless sensor, hospitals can upgrade normal beds into step-down intensive care units (ICUs) in under 5 minutes and enable remote and central monitoring of patients at wards. Dozee streams data from over 5,000 devices monitoring vitals such as heart rate, oxygen saturation and blood pressure to the Amazon Aurora database. This data is monitored for adverse events by customized machine learning models running on AWS. Dozee estimates it has saved over 75,000 nursing hours so far. Cloudphysician, for example, is redefining critical care with the application of cloud technology to optimize clinical operations in highly demanding, frugal ICU settings in India. They deliver a one-stop critical care solution that augments resource-constrained ICUs across India, where there is a shortage of intensivists or ICU specialists. Till date, Cloudphysician’s intensivist-led clinical teams have treated over 25,000 critically ill patients in 14 states. Government and private sector hospitals choosing Cloudphysician as a preferred partner to treat over 4,000 covid-19 patients represents a potentially game-changing shift in the tele-ICU approach. Cloudphysician-enabled ICUs manage life-and-death situations with both pre-emptive and prescriptive support for healthcare teams. This is made possible by Cloudphysician’s proprietary ICU management solution, RADAR, which allows clinicians to manage hundreds of patients 24x7. RADAR leverages highly reliable and scalable Amazon Web Services and seamlessly connects specialists. It also institutionalizes life-saving protocols every day, from Leh through the Cachar Valley in Assam and from Gujarat to Tamil Nadu.

The House returns to the Capitol from recess this week as lawmakers look to advance stopgap funding legislation that would prevent a partial government from occurring on September 30th. Additionally, Democrats in both chambers are negotiating the parameters of their $3.5 trillion spending plan and preparing to take messaging votes on issues including abortion and elections. SENATE SCHEDULE The Senate convenes Monday when it will take a confirmation vote on the nomination of Veronica Rossman to be a judge on the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals. Following Rossman’s confirmation, the Senate is expected to consider the nomination of a district court judge. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) is expected to schedule a procedural vote on Democrats’ latest election reform package, likely on Wednesday or Thursday. When it occurs the vote will lack the Republican support needed to reach 60 votes and continue the debate by overcoming the legislative filibuster. Committees will hold hearings on terror threats to the homeland 20 years after 9/11 ; fraud and scams during the pandemic ; and cybersecurity for federal and critical infrastructure systems . HOUSE SCHEDULE The House meets Monday for its first day of floor business since August 24th. It will consider several bills under the fast-track suspension of the rules process to extend expiring authorities at the Dept. of Veterans Affairs (VA), to provide a cost-of-living adjustment for veterans’ benefits, and to rename VA clinics. A number of other suspension bills may be considered over the course of the week. Lawmakers will take up several other notable bills before the work week concludes on Friday, including a continuing resolution to fund the government beyond September 30th to prevent a shutdown, which may also include an emergency spending package for disasters and Afghan resettlement. Democrats are also expected to bring up a bill to codify abortion rights under the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court precedent into federal law; in addition to the annual defense authorization package. Committees will hold hearings on terror threats to the homeland 20 years after 9/11 ; veteran suicide prevention ; and voluntary carbon markets in agriculture and forestry .

This has been further amplified with the advent of the Covid-19 pandemic and remote working as more discussions of these issues take place across the industry. Despite an increased focus, one area that we noticed being consistently overlooked is that of tax transformation. At best, tax transformation is considered a secondary or minor part of a wider finance transformation or, at worst, more of an afterthought. The tax function has traditionally been viewed as a consumer of data from business and finance systems. As such, engagement in transformation projects has often happened in the beginning or at the end. However, this fails to consider the possibility of tax requirements evolving through the course of a transformation. Without engagement throughout the entire process, the end product fails to address the specific needs for tax reporting. The exceptions to these are where tax is the driver of transformation, such as was the case during our previous implementation of the goods and services tax. From our discussions with CFOs and tax directors across the industry, we have observed a common trend in how tax is managed. In particular, there is a heavy reliance on manual processes, data-crunching, and reconciliation to prepare tax-relevant information. The investment in technology towards automating such processes is also virtually non-existent, with Microsoft Excel being a preferred option. The lack of investment and focus in this area could, in a way, be linked to how tax has been viewed over the years,that is, more of a cost and something that is not really an issue, until it becomes one. Unfortunately, this traditional view of tax is no longer applicable in today’s environment. We are no longer dealing with the same industry from 10 years ago, let alone 30-40 years ago which had a more traditional set of products whether it be deposits, loans, or insurance, among others. The industry has evolved and is now far more sophisticated with a complex array of products and services to meet customer demand and increase profitability. In addition to shifting revenue models, there has been a greater push to increase efficiencies through driving costs down. Tax has a crucial impact on the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement and one that has the potential to not only support but add value to the broader aims of the industry. An effective tax transformation through better planning, enhanced visibility and risk management, and improved return on capital, benefits not just the tax function, but finance and business as a whole. In short, the current environment needs the tax function to play the role of a strategic business partner. To become a strategic business partner, two tax transformation agents are needed, a tax technologist and a tax solution architecture plan. These two agents will help tax drive the tax transformation business plan and the budget to become a strategic business partner. So, what does a vision or a plan for tax transformation look like? As the saying goes, Rome wasn’t built in a day, and any transformation will take time to properly plan and execute. An effective transformation should start with the development of a roadmap and proposal, i.e. a tax solution architecture plan. Ideally such a plan should be developed with someone who is both familiar with tax processes and how technology can be used to improve such processes, i.e. a “tax technologist”, to get the most impact. Once the plan is developed, it should then go through scoping and development of a business case, followed by a design and implementation phase. While it might seem obvious, the importance of proper planning cannot be overstated. Tax transformation is not just new software; it is a re-engineering of an entire process. It is a change for people as well as the processes and data needed to support them, much of which may need to be examined in detail and rethought or reordered. To be most successful, full buy-in by finance and other involved non-tax functions is ideal. Finally, there needs to be a sufficient budget allocated, as without that budget, the vision is unlikely to be achieved. Taking into consideration the budgetary challenges, our suggestion is to think big and start small. One area to focus on would be understanding your data sources and mapping out the tax data requirements. There has to be an understanding of what data are needed, which are available today, and where they originated from. This will enable the function to communicate to dependent source departments the data required, and at what level. As opposed to simply identifying the source as a general ledger account or report from a sub ledger or other system, this will help tax departments move from a reconciliation function to a more powerful, flexible position as an end user of the data. Another opportunity for tax transformation may be the use of workflow tools to eliminate or reduce the use of spreadsheets. The goal will be the number of spreadsheets that can be removed, and to identify which specific spreadsheets are no longer needed. In the most effective tax transformations, there should be a simplification of the number of workbooks or tabs used. An additional area to take advantage of is the investments your business may already be making in terms of big data, cloud, and data science and ensure that these are leveraged and tax sensitised. Tax is the last piece in the process of closing the general ledger to produce the financial statements, and efficiency should be a leading driver in its transformation. If the provision can be completed in a week, why should it take nine months to complete the related tax returns? With the proper use of technology, that is a question that may never rise again. As the technology becomes cheaper and less complex to adopt and operate, tax must take this opportunity and realise its role as a strategic business partner.

6.80729E+16,Why <b>Artificial Intelligence</b> Research Needs More Women,https://womenlovetech.com/women-artificial-intelligence/,2021-09-19 19:41:15+00:00,2021-09-19 19:41:15+00:00,"Though <b>artificial intelligence</b> might bring to mind images of a future world run by robot overlords, it is far less ominous and science fiction-like than that.",,"× News Career Reviews Lifestyle Apps Podcasts Technology Privacy Policy Women Love Tech Career Contact About Advertise Terms of Use Why Artificial Intelligence Research Needs More Women Women Love Tech on September 20, 2021 It’s likely no surprise that women are still massively underrepresented in the tech industry today. Even with a push over the last few years for more women to pursue careers in STEM—science, technology, engineering, and mathematics—they still make up a tiny percentage of those working in the field. Data shows that of those doing STEM-focused research around the world, less than 30% are women . Unfortunately, when you narrow the focus down to women working specifically in smart tech and machine learning , the numbers get even smaller. You might wonder why it matters who is behind the data and code creation when it’s essentially a non-gendered machine or robot doing all of the processing, but it does. Machines aren’t inherently biased, but humans are, and when humans are teaching machines how to learn and what to do, our biases naturally become part of the code. Our computers, phones, and any other smart devices that we use today utilize technology that mimics our thought and decision-making processes. So if the majority of people working with smart tech such as artificial intelligence are men, then anything that utilizes AI will skew towards the male perspective. What Is AI and How Are We Using It Today? Though artificial intelligence might bring to mind images of a future world run by robot overlords, it is far less ominous and science fiction-like than that. AI is already a part of so many things that we use and interact with daily—it’s not the future—it’s the present. Though artificial intelligence sounds like a far-fetched term, it is basically the use of algorithms in computer systems to mimic how humans process information, and the more input it receives, the smarter it gets. It’s not just a part of our personal devices either; businesses are using AI to improve customer service and interpret data to further develop their systems and run more efficiently. Google is even leveraging the power of AI to create tools to enhance healthcare and help conservationists and scientists save endangered species and preserve indigenous languages. There is no end to the way we can harness the usefulness of AI. We can apply it to numerous situations to advance our capabilities and solve complex real-world problems. How Will Artificial Intelligence Shape Our Future? Artificial intelligence and deep learning systems are not just likely to change our future; it is already quite evident that they will and are already doing so. As humans, we are limited by our own minds and capabilities. There is only so much we can do—but AI and deep learning machines will allow us to scale our potential and complete tasks, projects, and missions that we would otherwise not be able to do. Deep learning refers to systems with more advanced neural networks that can actually draw conclusions from the input it receives and adapt to changes. In contrast, some more basic and earlier forms of AI machines can only do what they are specifically taught to do. Some examples of deep learning applications include: Facial recognition software Sound recognition software Natural language processing systems Systems that offer recommendations based on user interaction Video game AI So how will deep learning and other advanced forms of AI affect our future? The simple answer is that it will make everything easier and more efficient. As mentioned above, as humans, we can only do so much. We should continue to maintain a human presence and interactions within our business operations—people still need that human touch. But when it comes to interpreting data and solving complex equations to optimise our systems and make new advancements, we need the help of AI. Why Women Are Essential to AI Research Several industries can benefit from having more women, but especially those specifically handling the development and research of machine learning systems. AI is already an integral part of our society and nearly all industries. Our economy and its infrastructure run on many systems that use AI every day. The problem is, when these systems are all designed primarily by men, the processes that the computers use to learn and interpret data will result in a skewed outcome. Mark Minevich, a contributor to Forbes.com, writes , “—organisations will always fail to harness the fullest capacity of their digital innovations without including women, as machine learning technologies will be fed a constant stream of biased data, producing junk results that are not reflective of the full picture, causing potentially catastrophic harm to organisations.” And he’s right. If AI is becoming a significant part of our society and infrastructure, and women will undoubtedly continue to be a part of this society, we need to include them in the research and development of these systems. From transportation and education to media, customer service, and healthcare and wellness —industries are increasingly integrating artificial intelligence into their systems. Without more representation of women, the data these industries work off of and use to improve their operations will be deeply inaccurate. We don’t just need more women researching AI; we must have them. Continuing to leave them out is not an option. It is vital to the growth and success of AI itself and our growth as a society, and our ability to advance. Report by Beau Peters.

Amid global lockdowns and halted travel, the pandemic exposed the vulnerabilities of supply networks. ""Before Covid-19, people took climate change less seriously because food came by easily. But now this issue starts to surface in people's minds,"" said William Chen, director of the Food Science and Technology Program at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. Fruits and vegetables thrown into a waste bin Peter Dazeley | The Image Bank | Getty Images SINGAPORE — Covid-19 is a wake-up call that's highlighted the urgency to fight the world's food waste crisis, experts and industry players told CNBC. Amid global lockdowns and halted travel, the pandemic exposed the vulnerabilities of supply networks , as disruptions created bottlenecks in farm labor, transport and logistics and sparked global food shortages and price hikes. ""The pandemic is a very good wake-up call,"" said William Chen, director of the Food Science and Technology Program at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. ""Before Covid-19, people took climate change less seriously because food came by easily. But now this issue starts to surface in people's minds,"" he added. ""I don't see it as a lost cause, but a good opportunity to do a house-cleaning of the current system."" Food waste remains one of the biggest global challenges. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) estimates that one third of all food produced — or 1.3 billion tonnes — ends up lost or wasted every year. Food waste also accounts for 8% to 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions, another UN report showed . Reducing food waste could yield $700 billion in savings , according to Boston Consulting Group. And businesses in Southeast Asia are jumping on the bandwagon and going into food waste prevention, as well as redistribution and recycling of excess food. Growing appetite to tackle food waste In 2020, Singapore generated 665,000 tonnes of food waste, making up about 11% of the total waste generated in Singapore . Coming out of the pandemic, more hotels and airlines are now tackling food waste and putting sustainability ""front and center"" on their priority list, said Rayner Loi, co-founder and chief executive of Singapore-based AI food waste management start-up, Lumitics. This was a stark change from a few years back when food waste was ""barely on the radar"" and it was ""incredibly challenging"" to have conversations with industry players, said Loi. The growing receptiveness is thanks in part to increased education, new government regulations and sustainability being high on the corporate agenda, he said. VIDEO 9:53 09:53 Farmers are popping up in major cities — here's why CNBC Reports The firm developed an artificial intelligence-powered tracker installed in dustbins to measure and track all food waste. By learning in real time what and how much food waste was generated, chefs could take action to reduce the amount produced for certain dishes on the buffet line. This reduces food waste by up to 40%, and food costs by up to 8%, Lumitics found. From 2024 onwards, owners and occupiers of commercial and industrial premises in Singapore that generate large amounts of food will be required to segregate their food waste for treatment , according to a new legislation. Lumitics partners large hotel chains like Accor, Hyatt, Marina Bay Sands, as well as carriers such as Singapore Airlines and Etihad Airways. It plans to expand to 1,000 locations in the next five years across Asia-Pacific starting with Hong Kong, Malaysia, Indonesia and Australia. ""The entire industry is starting to wake up to this idea that food waste is one of the largest untapped cost saving opportunities for any kitchen,"" said Loi. Turning food waste into 'surprise boxes' Another player fighting food waste is Yindii, a Thai anti-food waste startup. It launched an app to connect eco-conscious Bangkok residents with bakeries, cafes, supermarkets and restaurants. These businesses fill up their unsold inventory in ""surprise boxes,"" which customers can snap up at discounted prices of 50% to 80% off at the end of the day, and get them delivered to their homes. Yindii founder and French entrepreneur Louis-Alban Batard-Dupre described Bangkok's food waste situation as ""catastrophic,"" where only 2% of food waste is recycled. In Thailand, some 17 million tonnes of unused food is dumped each year, and about 64% of its 27.4 million tonnes of waste is made up of organic waste , which includes food and kitchen waste. Most of the food businesses we've met think they don't waste much. When they start making quick calculations of what 6% to 14% of extra revenues mean, we usually get a call back. Louis-Alban Batard-Dupre founder, Yindii Industry players themselves have highly underestimated the problem. ""Most of the food businesses we've met think they don't waste much. When they start making quick calculations of what 6% to 14% of extra revenues mean, we usually get a call back,"" he said. Mindsets of merchants are changing too, as more brands prepare for a sustainable post-Covid tourism future, he said. Back then, they were ""shy to say they generate food waste because it reveals their stores don't sell out every day or because it's a dirty word,"" said Batard-Dupre. ""But telling the world you're fighting for the planet is so much more powerful than trying to hide such a systemic problem every business has."" Watermelons discarded near the Brahmaputra river, Bangladesh Andrea Pistolesi | Stone | Getty Images To date, Yindii has seen over 20,000 surprise boxes bought up. Redistributing the food that would have been thrown out also helps many living under the poverty line, he said. Yindii's partners include hotels such as Hilton Sukhumvit Bangkok, Grand Hyatt Erawan Bangkok, Sofitel Bangkok Sukhumvit and JW Marriott. Over the next few months, it is looking to expand to other cities in Thailand and South East Asia. Technology as a way forward Technology is starting to play a bigger role in tackling food waste. Southeast Asia is particularly vulnerable to food waste because it has many small-scale farm holdings that rely on intensive livestock farming and lack the means to invest in more efficient agri-tech, said Chen from NTU, who is also a consultant to the Asian Development Bank. The growing middle income class also consumes more. One of the UN Sustainable Development Goals aims to halve food waste by 2030 at the retail and consumer levels and reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including post-harvest. The slower we are to take action on climate change, the more we will see extreme weather and the greater the likelihood of zoonotic diseases — that could consequently increase food waste. Audrey Chia associate professor, National University of Singapore Business School More private-public partnerships will be key, where ""enthusiastic small start-ups"" can scale up with the help of technology and funding from the government, or work with big multinational corporations to plug the gaps, said Chen. Another lucrative venture is ""upcycling,"" which refers to taking ingredients that would usually be thrown out and processing them into new high-quality, marketable products. For instance, plant-based seafood firm Sophie's Kitchen is using soybean residue okara as a culture medium for microalgae cultivation in the fast-growing alternative protein market space. Other examples include adding higher valued ingredients like salted eggs to normally discarded fish skin or using black soldier flies to transform food waste into fertilizer, said associate professor Audrey Chia of the National University of Singapore Business School. Likewise, predictive technology could also help restaurants and retailers estimate demand or produce for food. ""Ironically, it is a vicious cycle. The slower we are to take action on climate change, the more we will see extreme weather and the greater the likelihood of zoonotic diseases — that could consequently increase food waste,"" said Chia.

Matt Amodio cruised to easy victories for the most part — aside from a brief scare on Thursday night's show. Some bold Double Jeopardy moves in the first round proved costly, and for the first time Amodio found himself in negative territory heading into the final round of categories. He quickly rallied and tallied up points at a feverous clip for the easy win. With Friday's win, Amodio has now won 23 straight games and amassed an astonishing $825,801 in winnings. He is now in third place all-time for number of consecutive games won in regular season play, and holds the same spot in the leaderboard from prize winnings in non-tournament play. It was also a week during which Akron played a role in the game. Amodio talked to host Mike Richards about checking an item off his bucket list when the Akron RubberDucks invited him on Aug. 4 — during the show's summer break — to throw out the first pitch at a minor league baseball game. He even correctly answered Akron's favorite rockers The Black Keys from a clue that mentioned Dan Auerbach. Amodio has racked some fairly impressive statistics by answering more than 700 questions correctly while missing on less than 100 and has about a 53 percent chance of beating his two opponents on the buzzer. And the 2009 Medina High School valedictorian has correctly answered the Final Jeopardy question 17 out of 23 times. The Cool Beans Cafe on Medina's Square has adopted a special menu for the hometown brainy hero. Among the eight items is Caffeine for $1200, which is a cup of hazelnut redeye coffee, and the #Matt Amodio is a honey and lavender Medina Square cup of cold brew coffee. The Ohio State graduate is pursuing his doctorate in artificial intelligence at Yale. The show airs at 7:30 p.m. on weekdays on WOIO (Channel 19) in Northeast Ohio.

Naveen Joshi Contributor Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. AI Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin AI in governance Shutterstock Corruption is one of the several unwanted constants around the world every year. According to an annual report created by Transparency International, in 2020, corruption was still widely prevalent—and, in several nations, rampant—across the world. What’s worse, the study also found that corruption affected and, in many cases, slowed down the global response to Covid-19 . Unfortunately, the point about corruption and catastrophes feeding off each other still holds true to this day. While corruption in certain countries may be higher than in others, it is still everybody’s problem to solve. Eliminating it completely is impossible as it is too ingrained in our social fabric now. Modern technology provides some hope in our collective crusade against global corruption. For example, the usage of AI in smart cities shows how governments can disperse citizen services efficiently with minimal to non-existent corruption present in the process. The potential of AI to detect and, eventually, reduce corruption in various places of power is high. Therefore, a problem like corruption needs to be handled with AI, along with other elements to support it. Data Mining to Combat Corruption Unsurprisingly, if AI is used as an anti-corruption tool, big data and analytics will contribute heavily towards the process too. Here’s a summary of how big data can assist AI with combating corruption: Initially, big data will play a significant role in collecting and compiling corruption-related information from various sources. This information is then fed into AI systems for processing and predictive analysis. Mining is the process of collecting data in massive quantities from relevant sources before an AI system looks for patterns and anomalies within the data to find specific relationships between variables. The use of data mining in the ongoing data science revolution can be likened to the use of coal mining playing a key role throughout the Industrial Revolution. But how does data mining resolve the corruption problem? MORE FOR YOU The Social Impact Case For Artificial Intelligence’s Role In Achieving Global Financial And Health Equality The Changing Face Of High Tech Fashion: How Two Entrepreneurs Are Bringing Diversity And AI To Clothing Design AI And Advanced Analytics In Shipping And Logistics: An Interview With Gregory Brown And Laura Patel, UPS In the last decade, Transparency International Georgia , a prominent anti-corruption body, launched an open-source analytics and procurement monitoring web portal that allows users to get information regarding the Georgian government procurement processes from official sources. Using that information, Georgian citizens can check specific procurement transactions, the names of the companies bidding for public contracts, and other statistical and factual data regarding how their government spends the taxpayers' money. Such easy access to data of that importance empowers curious individuals in the country to check for suspicious activity within the electronic tender-related information. If legal violations or possible corruption by governments are detected, people can submit an online complaint that will be seen by a specialized dispute resolution board. The board then goes on to review and address such complaints within ten days. Data mining is the driving force behind the collection of government procurement information. The incoherent big data generated from mining is used by AI, which understands, simplifies and structures information into user-friendly modules for the regular folk to read and comprehend. Data mining can be used to spot inconsistencies in the various recorded operations involving elected government authorities. The inconsistencies found are related to how their government spends public money. Once the mining phase is complete, data analytics takes over. Analytics is used to detect fraud or other irregularities in private and public bodies' online documents and websites. To fight corruption in procurement and other government-related activities, it is essential that accurate, verified information is uploaded onto official government websites consistently. Third-party auditors and data specialists must be hired to carry out the verification of all information uploaded online. Data mining and AI are useful for tax fraud detection, improvement of taxpayer compliance, money laundering and other types of fraud committed by politicians and other officials connected to the political spectrum. As we can see, data mining and AI form a potent combination to facilitate the detection and prevention of corruption-related activities in the field of public procurement and a few others. AI and Blockchain to Reduce Corruption in Pharmaceuticals Blockchain and AI share an interesting dynamic. As we know, both technologies have their own share of weaknesses. While blockchain systems demonstrate issues related to data scalability and efficiency, AI has shortcomings in areas such as explainability, data privacy and trustworthiness. When the two technologies are used together, they cover each other's deficiencies to form a potent combination. Blockchain brings explainability and privacy in AI systems, while the latter empowers blockchain systems to achieve greater scalability that can be useful for performance boosting, governance and personalization. Corruption is not just related to the political landscape or, in general, only the public sector. It can be found in the private sector too. In the last decade, the pharmaceutical industry had to deal with corruption allegations , and it continues to do so. When instances of corruption and fraud are found in big pharma—or any other—major private corporations, there are massive penalties, fines and other repercussions levied at the entity responsible for their possibly corrupt actions. The pharmaceutical industry is often accused of valuing profits more than the lives of actual patients in a hospital. AI and blockchain systems can help to address issues of corruption and fraud whenever they come up in pharmaceutical companies. Additionally, the information available to patients regarding health conditions and medicines can be improved with AI and blockchain systems in the healthcare industry. Patient knowledge is vital to prevent a specific type of corruption in the pharma industry. Pharmaceutical companies may bribe reputed physicians so that they can push their products on unsuspecting customers. So, customers looking for a specific medicinal product may end up purchasing the product recommended to them by the physician. As patient knowledge improves with clearer information, they do not have to depend on physicians who may try to push certain medicines and products just so that the pharma company making them can increase their own revenue. In many ways, the corruption in pharmaceuticals and other private sector bodies may be different from our general idea of the concept of corruption. By using blockchain and AI, pharma companies are prevented from paying bribes to physicians simply to promote their products. Blockchain and AI play their part in fostering faster information flow and data security so that such instances of corruption can be avoided by pharma companies. The increasing presence of AI in smart cities can reduce corruption in the private sector as well as the public sector. Predictive Analysis for Forecasting Corruption A few researchers from the University of Valladolid, Spain, have developed a concept AI model with artificial neural networks that can forecast corruption cases that could take place after one to three years. For example, the data generated from the system can check factors such as real estate tax in an area, a dramatic rise in housing prices there, the creation of brand-new companies in the area and the opening of bank branches there to predict a probable public corruption-related activity for the region. To do the study and create the system, the researchers used datasets that included every case of corruption that took place in Spain between the years 2000 and 2012. Predicting corruption can be truly challenging for AI systems, and the usage of predictive analysis—using past data to forecast future occurrences—is a decent idea if systems like these are used extensively in the future. The advancements in technology and the presence of AI in smart cities can allow systems like these to flourish. Challenges In Implementing AI to Fight Corruption Can AI Be Used As An Anti-Corruption Tool Allerin As ever, any technology application in a conceptual stage will come with its own set of issues. For AI, the two main challenges in its implementation as an anti-corruption tool are: a) A lack of explainability b) A lack of quality datasets The lack of explainability will leave network administrators and AI experts in hot water as they would not be able to justify certain AI decisions. So, using a combination of AI and blockchain helps, as stated above. The problem of dataset shortage can be resolved if the experts training such systems can get their research right and attain information regarding most—if not all—corruption cases in the recent and more distant past and include them to beef up the training datasets. The use of AI in smart cities and elsewhere can be useful to deal with corruption. However, as we have seen, many elements have to come together for the implementation to work successfully, and the process of implementing AI to curb corruption needs to be properly thought through by researchers and others involved.

Development of the map was led by scientists at Arizona State University. They partnered with coral reef scientists, universities, non-profit organizations and private groups across the world. The online map is designed to be a coral conservation tool that can also support ocean planning and coral science activities. Called the Allen Coral Atlas, the map was named after Microsoft’s late co-founder, Paul Allen. Allen’s private company, Vulcan Inc., started providing financial support to the project in 2017. The idea came out of an effort by researcher Ruth Gates of Hawaii to create “super coral” to help save reefs. When announcing the launch of the map recently, the creators said it is the first worldwide, detailed map of its kind. It gives users the ability to see detailed information about local reefs, including different kinds of undersea structures like sand, rocks, seagrass and coral. This Sept. 1, 2021, screen grab provided by the Allen Coral Atlas shows a map of the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. (Allen Coral Atlas via AP) The maps include areas up to 15 meters deep. They are meant to inform policymakers facing decisions about protected ocean areas, plans for structures and seawalls and coral renewal projects. Greg Asner led the effort to create the atlas. He is the director of Arizona State University's Center for Global Discovery and Conservation. He told The Associated Press that for the first time, the project had created “a uniform mapping of the entire coral reef” system. Asner said the researchers depended on a network of hundreds of field volunteers who provided local information about reefs. This enabled the team to program the satellites and software to study the right areas. The map includes a coral bleaching tool to identify corals that are struggling because of climate change and other problems. In this December 2019 photo provided by the Allen Coral Atlas, Alexandra Ordonez Alvarez, from University of Queensland, collects georeferenced data on the Great Barrier Reef's Ashmore Bank in Australia. (Chris Roelfsema/Allen Coral Atlas via AP) Asner said about 75 percent of the world's reefs had not been mapped in such a complete way before. He noted that many had not been mapped at all. The University of Queensland in Australia used artificial intelligence (AI) technology and local data to help build the atlas. Anyone can look at the maps for free online. Both Allen and researcher Ruth Gates died in 2018, leaving Asner and others to carry on their work. Asner said Gates ""would be so pleased…that this is really happening.” Asner said many of the calls he is receiving are from researchers who hope to use the maps to “be sure that their planning and their reef restoration work is going to have its max efficacy .” I’m Bryan Lynn.

Open Future The Economist Explains More Newsletters Podcasts Video Subscriber events iOS app Android app Executive courses Manage my account Sign out Search International The AUKUS squad The strategic reverberations of the AUKUS deal will be big and lasting A profound geopolitical shift is happening Sep 19th 2021 J UST OCCASIONALLY , you can see the tectonic plates of geopolitics shifting in front of your eyes. Suez in 1956, Nixon going to China in 1972 and the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989 are among the examples in living memory. The unveiling last week of a trilateral defence pact between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States (introducing the awkward acronym of AUKUS ) is providing another of those rare occasions. AUKUS envisages a wide range of diplomatic and technological collaboration, from cybersecurity to artificial intelligence, but at its core is an agreement to start consultations to help Australia acquire a fleet of nuclear-propelled (though not nuclear-armed) submarines . One consequence of this is Australia cancelling a contract, worth tens of billions of dollars, signed in 2016 with France for diesel-electric submarines. In announcing AUKUS on September 15th with the prime ministers of Australia and Britain, Scott Morrison and Boris Johnson, President Joe Biden stressed that it was about “investing in our greatest source of strength—our alliances”. However, America’s oldest ally, France, has reacted with understandable fury. Jean-Yves Le Drian, its foreign minister, called it a “ stab in the back ”. On September 17th President Emmanuel Macron withdrew France’s ambassadors from Washington and Canberra (though not London). The powerful reverberations of AUKUS show what a profound shift it represents. For America it is the most dramatic move yet in its determination to counter what it sees as the growing threat from China , particularly the maritime challenge it poses in the Pacific . Not only is America sharing the crown jewels of military technology, the propulsion plant for nuclear submarines, with an ally for only the second time in 63 years (the other time being with Britain). It is also robustly signalling its long-term commitment to what it calls a “free and open Indo-Pacific”. Many countries in the region which share the sense of threat from China welcome that. AUKUS will now provide a potent backdrop for the first in-person meeting of leaders of the Quad—America, Australia, India and Japan—in Washington, DC, on September 24th. Last month, amid a chaotic withdrawal from Kabul, there was talk of America’s lack of staying power and a loss of faith among its allies. For all the anger in Paris, AUKUS changes that narrative. “The larger significance of this is that the United States is doubling down on its allies, and its allies are doubling down on the United States,” says Michael Fullilove of the Lowy Institute, a think-tank in Sydney. “Unfortunately, France is collateral damage.” In Australian eyes the developments that led to AUKUS were largely made in China. It was the heavy-handed pressure that China has applied on Australia, the most striking recent example being the response to its call for an independent investigation into the origins of covid-19, that led to urgent interest in ways to push back. Ditching the submarine contract with France was a bold move. Although the deal with Naval Group, a company in which the French state has a majority stake, had run into difficulties over its escalating costs and delays, and had few friends among politicians or the press, it was nevertheless one of the largest contracts in the history of Australia and was widely thought to be too big to dump. That the government has done so, despite the prospect of hefty penalties, reflects both the scale of its bet on America as an ally and the attractions of the submarine technology it will obtain: far stealthier and with far longer range than the diesel-electric ones. Britain may be the least important of the AUKUS trio; certainly, its role is belittled in the French decision not to recall its ambassador to London (Mr Le Drian called Britain the “third wheel” in the deal). Even so, for Mr Johnson the pact illustrates his country’s changing role in the world . It conveniently chimes with the post-Brexit effort to promote “Global Britain” (henceforth to be energetically championed by a new foreign secretary, Liz Truss). And it gives substance to the “tilt to the Indo-Pacific” that was embraced in a comprehensive review of foreign and defence policy published in March. For the French, too, AUKUS crystallises what they view as profound realities in international relations, notably the idea that Europe needs more “strategic autonomy” so as not to depend excessively on America. However the muted reaction among France’s European partners casts familiar doubt on how serious such autonomy can be. After news of the AUKUS deal emerged, a German official called for “coherence and unity” among Western powers, which he said would require “a lot of effort” to bring about. France has concluded that it will struggle for fair treatment in the face of the reflexes of Anglophone allies to club together (the trilateral deal comes on top of the “Five Eyes” intelligence-sharing alliance that involves the same three countries plus Canada and New Zealand). But French fury, especially against Australia, is also driven by a personal sense of betrayal. That goes beyond the loss of a giant contract, painful as that is. France sets great store by its role in the Indo-Pacific region, where it keeps some 7,000 troops and has nearly 2m citizens, including in its island territories such as New Caledonia and French Polynesia. It has been assiduously building what it thought was an ever-closer relationship with Australia. As recently as August 30th the communiqué from high-level Australian-French ministerial consultations spoke of “the strength of our strategic partnership” across many areas, and stressed “the importance of the Future Submarine programme”. Yet neither at that summit nor at the many others over the months when AUKUS was in the works was France given any notice of it. The “six months of secrecy” was “quite a performance,” says François Heisbourg, a French foreign-policy expert who through his think-tank had for years been involved in cultivating connections with Australia. The fallout in France is one of several caveats to what otherwise appears to be a strategic coup for the three partners in AUKUS . The administration’s idea of working together with allies to check China makes sense. But a major split with a key ally—one with serious Indo-Pacific interests—hardly helps. Creative efforts will now be needed from the AUKUS squad to try to mitigate the damage. Second, there is what this says about American diplomacy. The French were bound to be upset, but the handling of them was graceless. That comes on top of the Biden administration’s poor handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan. One example of foreign-policy incompetence looks unfortunate; two in quick succession look like a pattern. That is not a good omen for the management of the relationship with China, which involves elements of military competition, economic laissez-faire and collaboration over, say, climate change and arms control. Third, American foreign policy has often been criticised, including by Mr Biden, for placing too much emphasis on the military dimension and not enough on diplomacy and other tools. The nuclear-submarine initiative is a big move on the defence front, but China is increasingly powerful in the region on the economic and financial fronts. China responded to AUKUS by criticising its “cold-war mentality”. The next day it applied to join the CPTPP , an 11-country transpacific trade pact that America helped to instigate as a way to limit China’s influence, but then abandoned. There is no quick fix for America’s mistakes in economic policy. Indeed, the rivalry between China and America, together with its allies, will play out across many areas over many years. It is the defining geopolitical challenge of the 21st century. And now in AUKUS it has acquired a new landmark.

AI Annie is the founder of Lips, an inclusive creative sharing platform. Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Law Library Giammarco via Unsplash AI is becoming more and more prevalent in society, with many people wondering how it will affect the law. How artificial intelligence is impacting our laws and what we can expect for future technology/legal interactions. The conversation surrounding the relationship between AI and law also touches quite clearly on the ability to rely on Artificial Intelligence to deliver fair decisions and to enhance the legal system’s delivery of equity and justice. In this article, I share insights from my conversations on this topic with Joilson Melo, a Brazilian law expert, and programmer whose devotion to equity and fairness led to a historic change in the Brazilian legal system in 2019, this change mainly affected the system that controls all processes processed digitally in Brazil, the PJe (Electronic Judicial Process). As a law student, Melo filed a request for action in the National Council of Justice (CNJ) against the Court of Justice of Mato Grosso, resulting in a decision allowing citizens to file applications in court electronically without a lawyer and within the Special Court, observing the value of the case, so that it does not exceed 20 minimum wages. Melo’s petition revealed provisions in the law that allowed for this and his victory enforced those provisions. The results for the underprivileged and those who couldn’t afford lawyers have been immense. On the relationship between AI and the Law, Melo remains a bit on the fence; “The purpose of the law is justice, equity, and fairness,” says Melo. MORE FOR YOU The Social Impact Case For Artificial Intelligence’s Role In Achieving Global Financial And Health Equality The Changing Face Of High Tech Fashion: How Two Entrepreneurs Are Bringing Diversity And AI To Clothing Design AI And Advanced Analytics In Shipping And Logistics: An Interview With Gregory Brown And Laura Patel, UPS “Any technology that can enhance that is welcome in the legal arena. Artificial Intelligence has already been shown that it can be as biased as the data that it is fed. This instantly places a greater burden of care on us to ensure that it is adopted through a careful process in the legal space and society at large” AI And Court Decisions The use of AI to predict jury verdicts has been around for quite some time now, but it's unclear whether or not an algorithm can accurately predict human behavior. There have also been studies that prove that machine learning algorithms can be used to help judges make sentencing decisions based on factors such as recidivism rates. In theory, this seems to solve a glaring problem, the algorithm tools are supposed to predict criminal behavior and help judges make decisions based on data-driven recommendations and not their gut. However, as Melo explains, this also presents some deep concerns for legal experts, “AI risk assessment tools run on algorithms that are trained on historical crime data. In countries like America and many other nations, law enforcement has already been accused of targeting certain minorities and this is shown by the high number of these minorities in prisons. If the same data is fed, the AI is going to be just as biased.” Melo continues, “Besides, the Algorithms turn correlative insights into causal insights. If the data shows that a particular neighborhood is correlated with high recidivism, it doesn’t prove that this neighborhood caused recidivism in any given case. These are things that a Judge should be able to tell from his observations. Anything less is a far cry from justice, unless we figure out a way to cure the data.” AI and Data Protection As we continue developing smarter technologies, data protection becomes an increasingly important issue. This includes protecting private information from hackers and complying with GDPR standards across all industries that collect personal data about their customers. Apart from the GDPR, not many countries have passed targeted laws that affect big data. According to the 2018 Technology Survey by the International Legal Technology Association , 100 percent of law firms with 700 or more lawyers use AI tools or are pursuing AI projects. If this trend continues and meets with the willingness of courts and judges to adopt AI, then they would eventually fall into the category of companies that need to abide by the data protection rules. Client/Attorney privilege could be at risk of a hack and court decisions as well. The need for stringent local laws that help regulate how data is received and managed has never been more clear, and this is why it is shocking that many governments have not acted faster. Joilson Melo Joilson Melo “Many governments have an unholy alliance with tech giants and the companies that deal most with data,” says Melo. “These companies are at the front of national development and are the most attractive national propositions for investments. Leaders do not want to stifle them or be seen as impeding technological advancement. However, if the law must apply equally, governments should take a cue from the GDPR and start now before we see privacy violation worse than we already have.” Legal Questions Surrounding AI As Artificial Intelligence becomes more ingrained in our lives, so do the legal issues that surround it. One of the most prevalent legal questions is whether machines should be allowed to possess self-driving cars and deadly weapons. Self-driving cars are already on the market but they have a long way to go before they could replace human drivers. The technology has not been perfected yet and will require huge strides forward before we can say with certainty that these vehicles are safe for society at large. The larger concerns about these touch on how easily these algorithms can be hacked and influenced externally. AI and Weapons/War Crimes: The possibility of autonomous weapons systems has been touted in many spheres as a powerful way to identify and eliminate threats. This has come against strong pushback for obvious reasons. Empathy, concession, and a certain big-picture approach have always played crucial roles in war and border security. These are traits that we still cannot inculcate into an algorithm. Human Rights Questions: One of the main questions that arise in the area of human rights is with regards to algorithmic transparency. There have been reports of people losing jobs, being denied loans, and being put on no-fly zones with no explanation other than, “it was an algorithmic determination.” If this pattern persists the risk to human rights is enormous. The questions of cybersecurity vulnerabilities, AI bias, and lack of contestability are also concerns that touch on human rights. Melo’s concern seems more targetted at the law and how it can be preserved as an arbiter of justice and enforcer of human rights and he rightly points out the implications of leaving these questions unanswered; “Deciding not to adopt AI in society and legal systems is deciding not to move forward as a civilization,” Melo comments. “However, deciding to adopt AI blindly would see us move back into a barbaric civilization. I believe that the best approach is to take a piece-meal approach towards adoption; take a step, spot the problems, eliminate them and then take another step.” Future Of AI And The Law The law and legal practitioners stand to gain a lot from a proper adoption of AI into the legal system. Legal research is one area that AI has already begun to help out with. AI can streamline the thousands of results an internet or directory search would otherwise provide, offerring a smaller digestible handful of relevant authorities for legal research. This is already proving helpful and with more targeted machine learning it would only get better. The possible benefits go on; automated drafts of documents and contracts, document review, and contract analysis are some of those considered imminent. Many have even considered the possibilities of AI in helping with more administrative functions like the appointment of officers and staff, administration of staff, and making the citizens aware of their legal rights. A future without AI seems bleak and laborious for most industries including the legal and while we must march on, we must be cautious about our strategies for adoption. This point is better put in the words of Joilson Melo; “The possibilities are endless, but the burden of care is very heavy we must act and evolve with cautiously.” Follow me on Twitter or LinkedIn .

Its focus is on helping companies in the food and beverage industry transform digitally. SupplyMe allows suppliers to list their products, get new customers, and have access to sales-related activities and more flexibility on promotions or price models, the report stated. In addition, SupplyMe offers a secured platform that uses less paperwork. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) allow businesses to identify purchase patterns and make the process of placing repeat orders easier, according to the reported. For customers, the benefits include a simplified buying process that cuts out phone calls and various kinds of paperwork. “Despite being one of the oldest industries, the food and beverage industry hadn’t changed much according to the times,” said SupplyMe Co-Founder and CEO Igor Nikolenko in the report. “However, the shift in consumption and purchasing patterns witnessed in 2020 led to B2B food industry embarking on its journey to embrace innovation, going paperless, and be more efficient.” He added that the industry is boosting and reconfiguring operations with the aid of new technology, per the report. “The app can help businesses to tap into new and difficult-to-reach markets, prioritize customer service, lower operating costs and increase the bottom line,” he said in the report. “Technology, particularly as a communication tool, is an integral part of everyday life for millennials,” said SupplyMe Co-Founder and Chief Operations Officer Husam Bardawil in the report. “B2B buyers favor omnichannel communication methods for quick and instantly gratifying information. [Ninety-four percent of] buyers prefer to complete their B2B purchase online without a sales representative. Hence the demand for online marketplaces will accelerate in the future, giving buyers the option to self-serve online ... through a single web-based platform.” In other B2B news, trade document automation company Conexiom has rolled out its cloud-based automation tool to automate documents for companies’ order-to-cash (O2C) and procure-to-pay (P2P) needs.

Internet of Things (IoT) Security Trends 2021 Home Cloud By Drew Robb September 19, 2021 While work from home has generated a whole new level of security threats, the Internet of Things (IoT) promises to up the ante even further. Think about the havoc caused by hundreds of millions of people suddenly working from home. This severely weakened and, in some cases, overwhelmed corporate security defenses. IoT could magnify such challenges. IoT may not be top of mind right now due to the scourge of ransomware. But it will no doubt rise again as the number of connected things grows exponentially. 5 Trends in IoT Security 1. Another major expansion of the organizational perimeter The IoT magnifies the threat level by several orders of magnitude. We are talking here about tens of billions of connected devices. IDC estimates that 41.6 billion connected IoT devices or things will be generating 79.4 ZB of data by 2025. Every one of them opens a door to the enterprise. Vendors have already come out with some IoT security-related tools. But the market remains largely in its infancy. Once the threat becomes more real, vendor offerings will multiply and grow in sophistication. For organizations, this all adds up to them having to secure an ever-widening net. 2. IoT will generate a LOT more data With the growth of connected IoT devices will come another major rise in data. There is a debate ongoing as to where that data will reside. Some say almost all will stay at the edge. Others want a lot more of it sent to major data centers. Regardless, data must be secured. Even if it is only information concerning the location of a car for a few moments, anyone being lax on access to that data will catch serious privacy heat. Whether data is at the edge, in the data center, or in the cloud, all of it will have to be fully secured. “We see a rise in edge computing devices that will reduce computer power in the IoT devices, but these will need to be managed and secured,” said Ashley Leonard, president and CEO of Syxsense . He made the point that the impact of IoT will be further magnified once 5G really gains traction. “5G and IoT will revolutionize the way we work and communicate but most importantly, the way we access information,” Leonard said. “Current IT security models that focus on perimeter security will not be effective when corporate data is exposed by 5G devices connected directly to the internet. Who can see and who owns your data?” See more: Internet of Things (IoT) Security Market 2021 3. Automation will become an even larger element within security Automation is already a major trend within security. It is used to trawl through mountains of logs, for instance, to isolate patterns and anomalies. Machine learning (ML) is also becoming a growing part of security in areas such as risk management, threat intelligence, and security information and event management (SIEM). But with the IoT, we can expect even more automation. When you are dealing in orders of magnitudes in the tens of billions, there is no way a security admin can be expected to manually cope. Automated security, therefore, will become an increasingly vital part of the security arsenal. 4. The lines of attack become wilder The IoT offers so many new lines of attack, many of which are hardly even being conceived off right now. Hackers, for example, can take over control of vehicles remotely. Greg Schulz, an analyst with StorageIO Group , adds planes, trains, and transit systems to the list of possible targets. And then you have drones, Alexa or Google devices, smart phones, computers, garage door openers, home heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), other building control systems, elevators, factory systems, warehouses, and robots. “Most companies have no idea what IoT systems are even connected to their corporate networks,” Leonard said. “This has huge security implications. A casino has already been hacked through an IoT thermometer in a fish tank.” 5. The need for standards Standards are vital in IT. Imagine what would happen if a dozen vendors and another few dozen startups set up their own disparate protocols and systems for managing the IoT. It would become a chaos of competing systems. And security would become a nightmare due to lack of integration. In fact, the lack of standards could be used as an excuse for failing to secure IoT systems and data. “Many IoT device vendors each have their own methods for updating security, but there are no standards,” Leonard said. He gave the example of homeowners. When did they last update their door-lock system, security cameras, or AC? In this brave new world of the IoT, think what those systems might be connected to? In many cases, they are connected to phones that contain the passwords to consumer and corporate systems. That provides an entry point of magnitude into the enterprise. But if the IoT really takes hold, sensors and devices will be everywhere — in every car, in every device, on the factory floor. Standards are vitally needed to simplify the securing of all if it.

The new app is a health navigation system that empowers its users to monitor their rate of aging and do something about it. The release comes a few weeks after a successful beta trial that saw thousands of participants use the app. They were able to measure key biometrics accurately, and some users were already able to slow their rate of aging, and most users were encouraged to take actions and decisions that positively affect their health. (Photo : Humanity) ALSO READ: Meet 'Humanity': The App That Helps Slow Aging and Has Global Investors Pumped Up Tracking Key Biomarkers Through Your Phone The Humanity app - now on the Apple App Store - works by tracking biomarkers such as heart rate and movement patterns. It also considers a wide range of lifestyle actions and decisions like sleep, nutrition habits, daily mood, and general wellbeing. After having an assessment, Humanity calculates the user's ""rate of aging"" and ""biological age,"" which is unique to each user. These values are computed based on a series of machine learning algorithms that the developers have validated against real-world outcomes, using data from longitudinal biobanks such as the UK Biobank and the NHANES in the United States. Next is the app compares user data with those having similar data to offer personalized guidance on what works to slow their rate of aging. ""We made Humanity to be radically inclusive. It is core to our mission to make an app that not only makes people healthier, but is something that almost every person on earth can and wants to use,"" says Humanity CEO and Co-Founder Peter Ward. ""We are delighted that our first 10,000 Beta users are already proving that Humanity is accomplishing that mission."" Humanity Co-Founder Michael Geer adds, ""Humanity"" is building a health navigation system for us all. We have next-generation navigation for our cars, and finally, with Humanity , we now have it for our health."" The app has already raised over $5m in investment from 65 leading tech and health investors. Some of its investors include Wise Co-Founder and Skype founding team member Taavet Hinrikus; MyFitnessPal Co-Founder Robin Thompson; Soundcloud Co-Founder and CEO Alexander Ljung; and more. About Humanity Pete Ward and Michael Geer teamed up some two years ago to revolutionize health and technology with Humanity . Their company, Humanity Inc, has developed the world's first digital health application that helps people understand what actions are working to slow or even reverse their aging rates. By tracking key age biomarkers and comparing them against an individual's daily actions and decisions. This technology is made possible by machine learning technology that allows the app to offer personalized guidance based on what works on people with roughly the same conditions. Both founders have had successful exits from running consumer subscription businesses that have amassed a billion total users and are now using their expertise towards helping humanity in living longer, healthier lives.

Durgana One lesson that our team has taken from the past 18 months is that no individual, no team, and no organization can be successful on their own. We’ve been grateful and humbled to witness incredible collaboration—taking on forms of resource sharing, knowledge exchange, and reimagined outcomes. Some advances, like breakthrough medicine, have been widely publicized. Other advances have received less fanfare. All of these advances are in the public interest and demonstrate how collaborations can be done “for good.” In reading this issue, we hope that you realize the power of diverse multidisciplinary collaboration; you recognize the positive social impact that statisticians, data scientists, and technologists can have; and you learn that this isn’t limited to companies with billions of dollars or teams of dozens of people. You, our reader, can get involved in similar positive social change. This special edition of CHANCE focuses on using data and statistics for the public good and on highlighting collaborations and innovations that have been sparked by partnerships between pro bono institutions and social impact partners. We recognize that the “pro bono” or “for good” field is vast, and we welcome all actors working in the public interest into the big tent. Through the focus of this edition, we hope to demonstrate how new or novel collaborations might spark meaningful and lasting positive change in communities, sectors, and industries. Anchored by work led through Statistics Without Borders and DataKind, this edition features reporting on projects that touch on many of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Pro bono volunteerism is one way of democratizing access to high-skill, high-expense services that are often unattainable for social impact organizations. Statistics Without Borders (founded in 2008), DataKind (founded in 2012), and numerous other volunteer organizations began with this model in mind: If there was an organizing or galvanizing body that could coordinate the myriad requests for statistical, data science, machine learning, or data engineering help, there would be a ready supply of talented individuals who would want to volunteer to see those projects through. Or, put another way, “If you build it, they will come.” Doing pro bono work requires more than positive intent. Plenty of well-meaning organizations and individuals charitably donate their time, their energy, their expertise, only to have an unintended adverse impact. To do work for good, ethics is an important part of the projects. In this issue, you’ll notice the writers’ attention to independent review boards (IRBs), respecting client and data privacy, discussing ethical considerations of methods used, and so on. While no single publication can fully capture the great work of pro bono organizations working in “data for good,” we hope readers will be inspired to contribute to open source projects, solve problems in a new way, or even volunteer themselves for a future cohort of projects. We’re thrilled that this special edition represents programs, partners, and volunteers from around the world. You will learn about work that is truly representative of the SDGs, such as international health organizations’ work in Uganda, political justice organizations in Kenya, and conservationists in Madagascar, to name a few. Several articles describe projects that are contextualized with the SDGs. While achieving many goals is interconnected, such as the intertwining of economic attainment and reducing poverty, we hope that calling out key themes here will whet your appetite for exploration. • Multiple articles focused on tackling aspects of SDG 3: Ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for people at all ages. • An article tackling SDG 8: Promote sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth; full and productive employment; and decent work for all. • Several articles touching on SDG 9: Build resilient infrastructure; promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and foster innovation; one is a reflection on building and sustaining free and open source software as a public good. • A handful of articles highlighting the needs for capacity-building and systems-strengthening aligned to SDG 16: Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development; provide access to justice for all; and build effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions at all levels. • An article about migration along the southern borders of the United States addressing multiple issues related to poverty (SDG 1), opportunity (SDG 10), and peace and justice (SDG 16). We sincerely hope that you enjoy this issue highlighting the use of data and statistics in the public interest and how collaborations are vital to this process. We’re excited for this issue to inspire you to give back in some way, whether through Statistics Without Borders, DataKind, or another organization.

Srikrishnan V, Vice-President, Enterprise Business, Hero Vired Hero Vired, the edtech company of the Hero Group, has ventured into enterprise business. While the focus of Hero Vired is B2C, through Vired for Business it will focus on corporate training (B2B). “We will assist enterprises in upskilling employees, sourcing talent, recruiting new people, implementing internal learning programmes and setting up internal knowledge academies,” says Srikrishnan V, vice-president, Enterprise Business, Hero Vired. In an interview with FE’s Vikram Chaudhary, he adds that Vired for Business will offer corporates and start-ups curriculum in the areas of full stack development, data science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, finance, fintech, leadership, entrepreneurial thinking and innovation. Excerpts: Is Vired for Business similar to Coursera for Business and upGrad for Business? Is going B2B a natural business extension for a B2C edtech company? Related News Lost in numbers? Maths learning deteriorated due to Covid-19, says Cuemath report Shikshak Parv 2021: Celebrating teachers, unleashing reform SRCC, Vedantu to hold National Economics Olympiad Our core value proposition is certificate programmes; we have CXOs as faculty on board, and so it’s natural for us to reach out to enterprises and cater to the B2B audience as well (in addition to B2C). This initiative (Vired for Business) has been in the works for the last three months. Is B2B more profitable than B2C? I would say it is the other way round. More important than profitability, it’s the recurring business (in B2B). For example, if Vired for Business gets into a partnership with the Financial Express to train the latter’s workforce, we know that we will continue to work with them for quite some time. So it gives a sense of predictability to the business. Hero Vired was started just about six months ago. Aren’t you entering too soon into the enterprise business? When we started Hero Vired, the goal was solving skills needs of industry. The enterprise business was always part of the plan. How will Vired for Business differentiate itself? One, our courses are 90% instructor-driven. Two, CXOs are part of our faculty. Three, we will be offering companies tailor-made solutions. Four, our programmes have been developed in collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Singularity University and Codecademy (the American online platform that offers free coding classes). I think the ability to create bespoke programmes will resonate well with our customers. Will you also teach soft skills? We will offer holistic learning programmes, and this means soft skills will be part of these.

Our data and machine learning-driven engine proved unmatched for late-stage recoveries. Clients asked us to expand our product suite to address early-stage delinquency while keeping their customers in their brand ecosystem, and we were happy to oblige.” Retain aims to prioritize client engagement and preference, which is important when it comes to preserving the lender-borrower relationship, “with custom communications, timing and channels and a self-serve payment platform that empowers customers to easily manage their accounts.” Unlike the typical call-to-collect early-stage collections, which need increased outbound call center volumes, Retain engages users “more effectively and efficiently with a digital-first approach and can reduce costs by transforming call centers into productive inbound operations,” the update revealed. Ohad Samet , Co-founder and CEO of One True Holding Company, TrueAccord’s parent company, remarked: “Retain takes all the innovative customer engagement processes we’ve built and adds a brand-focused retention toolkit for our clients to easily plug and play to engage with their delinquent customers. Retain adds to our product and service offerings designed to improve the experience for consumers in debt and actually help them find a path toward a better financial future.” As previously reported, TrueAccord is the intelligent, digital-first collection and recovery firm that “leaders across industries trust to drive breakthrough results while delivering a superior consumer experience.” TrueAccord pioneered the industry’s “only adaptive intelligence: a patented machine learning engine, powered by engagement data from over 16 million consumer journeys, that dynamically personalizes every facet of the consumer experience – from channel to message to plan type and more – in real-time.” Combined with code-based compliance and a self-serve digital experience, TrueAccord “delivers liquidation and recovery rates 50-80% higher than industry benchmarks.” The TrueAccord product suite “includes Retain, an early-stage collection solution, and Recover, a full-service post-charge off recovery platform.” As noted in the announcement, One True Holding Company is a tech firm offering business- and consumer-facing services in the consumer debt space. Subsidiaries include TrueAccord, which provides machine learning-powered, digital- and mobile-first servicing “for debt in collections and recoveries, and True Life Solutions, which offers a SaaS platform that consumers can use to contact collectors and creditors digitally.” Sponsored Links by DQ Promote You may also like...

Notiv - Notiv brings AI-driven notetaking and action items to every call and meeting - Adds advanced technology capabilities in real-time transcription, artificial intelligence, and advanced natural language processing - Adds revenue generating service to existing and expanded Dubber customer base - Delivers product capabilities that enrich Dubber Foundation and broader service provider offering - Accelerates Dubber's AI program and expands Dubber core offerings - Circa A$6.6m acquisition by way of cash and equity News provided by Dubber Sep 19, 2021, 19:55 ET Share this article Share this article MELBOURNE, Australia , Sept. 19, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Dubber Corporation Limited (ASX: DUB) (Dubber) announces today that it has acquired Brisbane, Australia based technology group Notiv ( https://www.notiv.com) . Notiv is a developer of innovative cloud-native AI-based products that turn meetings into transcribed notes, summaries, signals, actions, and more. Steve McGovern , CEO, Dubber: ""One of our fundamental beliefs is that artificial intelligence has a part to play as a standard feature of every call and conversation. Notiv is a significant step towards achieving this in that it has clear and defined use cases for everyone from individuals to the largest of enterprises. With Notiv, Dubber will now have the ability to automatically take notes and create action items on every call. We are confident that our telecommunications carrier and service provider partners will see enormous potential for revenue-generating value-added services for their customers at scale. We welcome the Notiv team to Dubber along with the AI and data science expertise they bring. We see the teams combining to form the core of our Dubber AI Labs for developing future AI capabilities. The integration of the Notiv business is accretive for both parties in that Dubber can expose the fantastic capability of the Notiv offering to a global customer base and the Notiv team can develop a continuous stream of revenue-generating services for Dubber's addressable market. Dubber's overall strategy is to grow organic Annualised Recurring Revenue (ARR) while augmenting that growth with strategic acquisitions where possible. Acquisitions must either add accretive and synergistic revenue or provide substantial product and technology capability, which will drive organic ARR growth. The Notiv acquisition reflects that strategy perfectly, and the speed at which the parties have executed the transaction now enables the Company to continue to pursue other identified opportunities."" Notiv will be available to Dubber Foundation Partners, select service and solution providers and sold alongside other Dubber solutions for businesses and Government. Chris Raethke , Co-Founder & CEO, Notiv: ""The Notiv team is exceptionally proud of the technology we have developed. The ability to roll out Notiv globally with the world's leading service providers is an unmissable opportunity. The chance to join the Dubber growth journey at this time and expand Dubber's AI and NLP capabilities is exciting for all of us. We are confident that the combination of Dubber and Notiv will deliver incredible value to customers, businesses and our fellow shareholders alike."" James Slaney , COO, Dubber: ""Dubber has over 150 global service provider network partners as well as all of the world's primary unified communications solutions - and is the only true native, cloud-first service of its kind. Our strategy has always been to use this footprint to deliver layers of value and drive associated revenues. Notiv suits this strategy perfectly and accelerates our existing AI program in three ways. First, we gain an exciting and proven product built to answer a compelling use case - making meetings better by automatically enabling voice data to replace or improve note taking.  We believe that the ability to create notes, highlights and action items in every video and phone call provides invaluable use cases for every demographic, from individuals to large enterprises, thereby expanding Dubber's already large addressable market. Enhanced productivity can benefit everybody in all methods of communication. For example, a tradesperson on a mobile phone call could instantly capture customer requests and share the actions. Likewise, C-level executives could use Notiv to note and capture actions in a planning meeting. Second, we believe that the ability to deliver this capability directly from the network will be a compelling proposition for both existing and new service provider partners.  As well as the opportunity for service providers to drive new services, incremental revenue and differentiation, we believe that Notiv is an ideal product to increase the value of our industry-first Foundation Partner program. Finally, Notiv will provide Dubber with a world-class team with deep expertise in AI and data science. Together we will accelerate our overall product roadmap and capabilities and advance our AI, digital signal processing and natural language processing technologies. Notiv furthers our leadership in capturing and transforming conversations between one person and another - and large groups of people in a meeting. We are continuing to unlock the potential of AI on every end-point and enabling our service and solution providers to make the critical shift from selling connectivity to extracting the value in every conversation on their networks. They'll now be able to do that with Dubber Notiv on the same hyper-secure, scalable and compliant infrastructure that Dubber has already made available to over 150 service providers globally - including all the world's leading UC solutions."" Key Transaction Terms: Dubber has acquired Notiv through the purchase of all of the issued share capital of holding company Pinch Labs, Inc., a US corporation that wholly owns and operates the Brisbane -based operations and technology Aggregate consideration of approximately A$6.6 million A$5.15 million paid in cash at completion and the balance, representing 24.8% of the consideration, is to be satisfied by way of the issue of 386,277 Dubber fully paid ordinary shares at a deemed issued price of A$3.75 .  The shares will be issued within Dubber's existing Listing Rule 7.1 issue capacity Key management and employees are to stay with the business, including Chris Raethke , Co-Founder & CEO and Dr Iain McCowan , Co-Founder and CTO The agreement also includes provisions customary for a transaction of this nature, including warranties and representations, confidentiality and non-competition/solicitation Strategic Rationale Accretive fundamentals. Proven application and technology with customers with strong product-market fit and alignment to the Dubber solution set Enriches Dubber's service and solution provider offering - and current product offerings. Accelerates Dubber's technology roadmap both in terms of providing Dubber with access to AI technologies and also adding a critical and differentiated product Furthers differentiation and value of Dubber Foundation Partner Program - and its more than 150 service and solution provider customers worldwide Broadens Dubber's conversational intelligence offerings Dubber to accelerate the adoption of Notiv globally. Provides Notiv with critical sales and marketing resources to scale go-to-market capabilities Strong synergies in product approach mean technologies can be easily unified into common platforms with the potential to create efficiencies over time Key shareholder support. All key management shareholders retained in the business with incentives to continue strong performance Financial Impact Scrip and cash consideration up-front. No further amounts payable No incremental investment in staff or technology required to achieve scaling Strong potential to enhance future revenue (or stated revenue), typical of an early-stage technology venture This ASX announcement has been approved for release to ASX by Steve McGovern , CEO & Managing Director.

As we reported , the first pair of Astro Pis were taken to the IIS by British astronaut Tim Peake in December 2015 as part of the Principia mission. At the beginning it was just UK school pupils who were able to code the Pi's, but the following year this opportunity was extended to all of the ESA States. Since they arrived at the IIS the original Astro Pis, which were specially encased first generation Raspberry Pis and were named ""Ed"" and ""Izzy"", have run code written by more than 54,000 young people from 26 countries across Europe and Canada. Now two new Astro Pi units have been designed to replace them and will go into space in December ready for use next year. In this video ESA astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti reveals their specs: The new Astro Pis are Raspberry Pi 4 Model Bs with 8GB of memory. As before they have a special rugged, lightweight, aluminum casing and are equipped with gyroscope, accelerometer, magnetometer, and sensors to measure humidity, temperature and pressure. They have new color and luminosity sensors which will expand the range of experiments that students can design. The new Astro Pis are also fitted with the Raspberry Pi High Quality Camera which will not only will provide for taking full color photographs of Earth, but also enable teams to investigate plant health thanks to the higher-quality optical filter in conjunction with the IR-sensitive camera. The other new kit is Google's Coral Machine Learning Accelerator which will allow teams to  develop machine learning models enabling high-speed, real-time processing. Once aboard the IIS the Astro Pis will be ready for the new  European Astro Pi Challenge run by the Raspberry Pi Foundation in collaboration with ESA Education. As before, there are two challenge levels, both open to young people aged 19 or under  from ESA Member States, or Slovenia, Canada, Lithuania, Latvia, or Malta. Mission Zero, suitable for beginners, requires a simple Python program that takes a sensor reading and displays a message on the LED screen. In addition all Mission Zero participants will have the opportunity to vote for the names of the two new Astro Pi computers. Mission Space Lab is for teams of 2-6 young people who want to code their own scientific experiment for the Raspberry Pi computers aboard the ISS. Registration closes on 29 October 2021 and teams whose experiment idea is accepted into Phase 2 of the challenge will receive an Astro Pi kit to help design and test their experiments on Earth. These kits provide a Raspberry Pi 4 computer with 4GB RAM and the array of sensor plus a Raspberry Pi HQ Camera, Where teams are conducting experiments involving machine learning, a Coral machine learning accelerator will also be supplied. This sounds like a great way for teachers to bring computing and electronics into the classroom. And at the end of the day the experiments are sent into space. It brings a whole new perspective to Raspberry Pi IoT. Harry Fairhead has a hardware background having worked with microprocessors and electronics in general, for many years. He is the author of Raspberry Pi IOT in C, 2nd Ed and Raspberry Pi IoT in C with Linux Drivers and co-author of Raspberry Pi IOT in Python with GPIO Zero and Raspberry Pi IoT In Python Using Linux Drivers .

Go ahead, grab it and give it a little shake. The plastic case your card goes into is sometimes replaced by a phony case which captures your pin and card info while you’re conducting a legitimate transaction. When you’re walking away from the ATM, don’t react to any “Watch Our For Pickpockets!” signs you might see. Police in Hungary discovered that pickpockets themselves were putting up the signs. That’s because people instinctively reach for their valuables when warned of pickpockets, immediately telegraphing where da loot at. If you think there’s lots of fraud happening in the real world, wait until you what’s happening in the digital world. That’s probably why Feedzai, another private company to recently join the unicorn club, is gaining traction for its machine learning platform to prevent and detect fraud and money laundering in the financial services sector. Fraud is on the Rise And if you believe the statistics – many of them from Feedzai, which issues quarterly financial crime reports – fraud in the financial services sector is out of control. All banking fraud across the Internet, telephone, and in-person banking ( people still do that? ) – grew 159% in the first quarter of this year compared to the last quarter of 2020. Online banking, which accounts for 96% of all banking transactions, made up 93% of all fraud cases. The analysis reportedly covers more than 12 billion global banking transactions. But let’s remove the implied bias and turn to a neutral party: The consumer credit reporting behemoth TransUnion, comparing a similar period of time, said that suspected financial services digital fraud attempts increased 149% . That’s what we could call a growth market: Growth of the fraud detection and prevention market in billions. Credit: Statista With a company name that’s impossible to spell over the phone, Feedzai seems to be putting itself in the pole position within the fraud detection and prevention market. A New AI Fintech Unicorn Founded in 2009, the Silicon Valley-based startup has raised $277.5 million in disclosed funding, with most of the money coming from a massive $200 million Series D in March. That vaulted the company to a valuation of $1 billion. While most of the names on the investor list skew toward the venture capital (VC) side of the spectrum, such as Sapphire, another notable name is the venture arm of Citigroup ( C ). It’s usually a pretty good sign when one of the largest banks in the world not only buys your product but also invests in it, including an undisclosed venture round back in 2016. In fact, Feedzai’s war chest may be north of $300 million, as the private company just raised another undisclosed venture round at the beginning of this month from a little VC firm based in Madrid, Spain called Conexo Ventures. The investment will make a little more sense later on in our story. How Does Feedzai Use AI to Detect Fraud? The answer: Pretty damn quick. The startup claims its platform can calculate a risk score in three milliseconds, evaluating thousands of decisions to score a transaction in real time. Machine learning models identify patterns in the transaction by analyzing customer behaviors and profiles, as well as leveraging external, third-party data that the models use to assess the risk of the transaction and detect financial crime patterns. Customers can customize the models by adding other rules and lists to fine tune the decision to approve, reject or review. The result is reportedly transparent with clear documentation for the decision. The Feedzai AI platform clearly documents its decisions and provides cool-looking visualization tools to detect larger patterns of fraud. Credit: Feedzai But it’s not all up to the machine: A risk analyst reviews the transaction scores and fraud alerts, passing on anything suspicious to a company’s senior data analyst. This person uses Feedzai’s AI-powered visual analysis tool called Genome, which can help uncover larger patterns of financial crime and fraud. All decisions are fed back into the machine learning model to improve performance over time. Feedzai Use Cases The platform protects financial institutions against funny business involving account openings, transactions, and money laundering. Its clients include retail banks, payment processors, and merchants, among others. Feedzai claims it monitors companies that serve more than 800 million customers in 190 countries, with products protecting half of the populations in the UK and Canada, as well as four of the five largest banks in North America. But here’s the stat that really caught our attention: More than 20% of the world’s money flows through the Feedzai platform, according to the company. Credit: Feedzai In addition to Citibank, other large financial institutions such as Fiserv ( FISV ) and Santander ( SAN ) are also customers, along with fintech companies like SoFi ( SOFI ) and Mox by Standard Chartered. Another customer that is part of the new generation of financial institutions is SafetyPay, a digital alternative payment platform focused in Latin America and Europe. SafetyPay allows consumers to shop online via bank transfer or cash without sharing their information online.  Feedzai comes into the picture by monitoring patterns in payment activity and comparing them against a customer’s historical data to authenticate transactions. Feedzai Acquires Revelock No doubt Feedzai will take some of its new fortune to further build out its platform. In fact, the company wasted little time doing just that by acquiring Madrid-based Revelock, a behavioral biometric platform, for an undisclosed amount of money last month. Founded in 2015, the startup had raised $14.3 million to date. Most of the investors are headquartered in Spain, including a name that showed up earlier – Conexo. Biometrics employs various technologies to verify or authenticate identity , including everything from facial recognition on your iPhone to voice verification to the way you handle your mobile device . In the case of Revelock, the company has developed a hybrid AI model that powers BionicID, a unique digital identifier that is created by collecting each user’s thousands of biometric, behavioral, device, and network data points. It continuously analyzes user behavior, from login to logout, across every interaction. If everything appears cool, the session continues uninterrupted. Otherwise, Revelock goes into action, which might involve verifying the user with stepped-up authentication, terminating the user session, or locking the account. Apparently ticks are part of the threat intel. Credit: Revelock Feedzai has some grand plans around this acquisition to create the “world’s largest Financial Intelligence Network, a vault of more than a trillion data points, sessions, and profiles of both good and bad actors.” The network would combine Feedzai’s 150 billion data points for fraud detection with Revelock’s BionicID, a sort of human digital twin , based on how it’s described. Of course, every session promises complete anonymity to “ensure people are treated as people and not as data points.” Conclusion The digital shift of the economy is becoming seismic, with The Rona shaking things up even harder when people started treating paper money like the plague, with ATM withdrawals down 58% in 2020 . About 41% of consumers switched from cash to online/phone payments and more than half of them do not plan to switch back to cash, according to Zelle , the mobile payment app that defaults to sharing your every transaction on social media. Meanwhile, the bad guys haven’t missed a beat, finding new ways to separate people from their money and identities. Fintech companies like Feedzai are betting they can outsmart them with artificial intelligence. Tech investing is extremely risky.
