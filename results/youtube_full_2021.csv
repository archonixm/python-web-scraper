Proper credit assignment over long timespans is a fundamental problem in reinforcement learning. Even methods designed to combat this problem, such as TD-learning, quickly reach their limits when rewards are sparse or noisy. This paper reframes offline reinforcement learning as a pure sequence modeling problem, with the actions being sampled conditioned on the given history and desired future rewards. This allows the authors to use recent advances in sequence modeling using Transformers and achieve competitive results in Offline RL benchmarks.

Abstract:
We present a framework that abstracts Reinforcement Learning (RL) as a sequence modeling problem. This allows us to draw upon the simplicity and scalability of the Transformer architecture, and associated advances in language modeling such as GPT-x and BERT. In particular, we present Decision Transformer, an architecture that casts the problem of RL as conditional sequence modeling. Unlike prior approaches to RL that fit value functions or compute policy gradients, Decision Transformer simply outputs the optimal actions by leveraging a causally masked Transformer. By conditioning an autoregressive model on the desired return (reward), past states, and actions, our Decision Transformer model can generate future actions that achieve the desired return. Despite its simplicity, Decision Transformer matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art model-free offline RL baselines on Atari, OpenAI Gym, and Key-to-Door tasks.

In this video I discuss JavaScript as it stands in the year 2021, as it relates to data science.   We answer the question - if you're a coming, aspiring data scientist, is this something you should learn?

JavaScript has been around since 1995, and is one of the primary scripting languages of the internet alongside HTML and CSS.   The trademark of it is owned by Oracle, but the language is defined by an organization called the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA).   It is an object oriented language that is generally compiled ""just in time"", is dynamically typed, but is not open source.   The most common way it is used is through Node, which is a command-line interpreter.   Through that you can use NPM, or the Node Package Manager, to install JavaScript libraries.

Some helpful libraries for data science include: D3.js, nlp.js, ml.jl, and TensorFlow.js.",JavaScript,Cascading Style Sheet (CSS); Command-Line Interpreter; D3.js; Data Science; Github; Graph; HyperText Markup Language (HTML); Internet; JavaScript; Natural Language Processing (NLP); Node.js; Oracle; Package Manager; Scripting Language; TensorFlow; Video; Youtube

Visualizations - How to Win a Data Science Competition: Learn from Top Kagglers
Advanced Machine Learning Specialization
If you want to break into competitive data science, then this course is for you! Participating in predictive modelling competitions can help you gain practical experience, improve and harness your data modelling skills in various domains such as credit, insurance, marketing, natural language processing, sales‚Äô forecasting and computer vision to name a few. At the same time you get to do it in a competitive context against thousands of participants where each one tries to build the most predictive algorithm. Pushing each other to the limit can result in better performance and smaller prediction errors. Being able to achieve high ranks consistently can help you accelerate your career in data science.

In this course, you will learn to analyse and solve competitively such predictive modelling tasks. 

When you finish this class, you will:

- Understand how to solve predictive modelling competitions efficiently and learn which of the skills obtained can be applicable to real-world tasks.
- Learn how to preprocess the data and generate new features from various sources such as text and images.
- Be taught advanced feature engineering techniques like generating mean-encodings, using aggregated statistical measures or finding nearest neighbors as a means to improve your predictions.
- Be able to form reliable cross validation methodologies that help you benchmark your solutions and avoid overfitting or underfitting when tested with unobserved (test) data. 
- Gain experience of analysing and interpreting the data. You will become aware of inconsistencies, high noise levels, errors and other data-related issues such as leakages and you will learn how to overcome them. 
- Acquire knowledge of different algorithms and learn how to efficiently tune their hyperparameters and achieve top performance. 
- Master the art of combining different machine learning models and learn how to ensemble. 
- Get exposed to past (winning) solutions and codes and learn how to read them.

Disclaimer : This is not a machine learning course in the general sense. This course will teach you how to get high-rank solutions against thousands of competitors with focus on practical usage of machine learning methods rather than the theoretical underpinnings behind them.

Prerequisites: 
- Python: work with DataFrames in pandas, plot figures in matplotlib, import and train models from scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM.
- Machine Learning: basic understanding of linear models, K-NN, random forest, gradient boosting and neural networks.

This course is fantastic. It's chock full of practical information that is presented clearly and concisely. I would like to thank the team for sharing their knowledge so generously.,I really enjoyed this course but it was probably 2-3 times more work than I anticipated. Most of that extra time comes from working on the final project, testing things out, etc.
We will start this week with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). It is a very broad and exciting topic and an essential component of solving process. Besides regular videos you will find a walk through EDA process for Springleaf competition data and an example of prolific EDA for NumerAI competition with extraordinary findings.

They're fast and super scalable but how do they work?

Behind-the-scenes, they use a keyspace to distribute your data across multiple servers or partitions. This allows them to scale horizontally across many thousand servers.

NoSQL databases can operate in multiple modes: as key-value store, document store or wide column store.

You can run your own NoSQL database with software like Cassandra, CouchDB, MongoDB or Scylla. You can also use a cloud version like AWS DynamoDB, Google Cloud BigTable or Azure CosmosDB.

0nWo_KlAdNM,How I use the SPARK AMP&#39;s Application to help me to LOOP sections and LEARN NEW SONGS.,Sypher - My Six String Guitar Journey,https://youtube.com/watch?v=0nWo_KlAdNM,2021-01-11T11:51:26Z,This video looks to answer a number of questions that have been put to me over the last couple of weeks. The first is to look at how I use the Positive Grid Spark ...,en-GB,7686,170,15,70,9.0,"This video looks to answer a number of questions that have been put to me over the last couple of weeks.  The first is to look at how I use the Positive Grid Spark Amp's companion Application (iPhone app) to help me to learn how to learn to play new songs using a looped section.

Another question was how easy is the app to use on my iPhone and then people also wanted to know whether there is help with the strumming patterns, notes, chords to play and more.  I hope to answer all of this in this email and I will try to demonstrate playing along to Bon Jovi's 'You Give Love A Bad Name' using both the Spark Practice Amp and also my smaller Blackstar practice amp, of course you could just use headphones into your phone or mobile device.

I show all of this using my iPhone to answer those of you who have asked how usable the iPhone is when an iPad is not available.  The video does show the iPad interface so that you can see the difference.

In the video, I run through a demo of jamming along (not very well I hasten to add) to a Spotify track using my Spark 40 Amp and then also without using the Spark 40 Amp and just using my iPhone.

00:00 - Introduction.
01:35 - Would I use an iPad, if I had one?
01:58 - A quick look at the iPad interface.
02:53 - A positive point about using my iPhone.
03:27 - Smart Jam - How many people use it.
05:31 - Does the app show strumming patterns and notes to play?
06:44 - How I use the app with Spotify and the looper to learn new songs.
09:25 - Setting up the loop section and playback speed.
10:25 - Demo - Looping a section to the Spark 40 Amp.
11:28 - Demo - Looping a section without using the Spark 40 Amp.
13:13 - Summary and Close.
14:37 - Short Play Out, Jamming to Bon Jovi's You Give Love A Bad Name.

Title: Graph Neural Networks and Applications to Deep Reinforcement Learning

Abstract: Many interesting problems involve processing information that's best represented by graphs. To that end, prior work has introduced Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that bring the powerful capabilities of deep learning to graphical inputs. In this talk, I will provide an overview of various GNN techniques, including GCNs, as well as applications seen in recent research in Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). I will go in depth on using graphs to represent common-sense, prior knowledge about the world, and how that can be leveraged for faster learning.",Reinforcement,Deep Learning; Golang; Graph; Machine Learning; Neural Network; Physics; Processing; Reinforcement Learning; Research

--

Today, artificial intelligence helps doctors diagnose patients, pilots fly commercial aircraft, and city planners predict traffic. These AIs are often self-taught, working off a simple set of instructions to create a unique array of rules and strategies. So how exactly does a machine learn? Briana Brownell digs into the three basic ways machines investigate, negotiate, and communicate.

About the course:
This is a Free Course by Manifold AI Learning on Youtube

With the Deep learning making the breakthrough in all the fields of science and technology, Deep Learning Computer Vision is the field which is picking up at the faster rate where we see the applications in most of the applications out there.

Be it, Facebook's image tagging feature, Google Photo's People Recognition along with Scenery detection, Fraud detection, Facial Recognition, We are seeing the Deep Learning Computer Vision Applications out there. 

A typical task in Deep Learning Computer vision task will include the methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of these high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, with which we can form decisions.

A typical & basic operation we perform is - Convolution Operations on Images, where we try to learn the representations of the image so that the computer can learn the most of the data from the input images.

In this course,

We will be learning one of the widely used Deep Learning Framework, i.e PyTorch

It is said as,

PyTorch to be Goto Tool for DeepLearning for Product Prototypes as well as Academia.

We are going to prefer learning - PyTorch for these Reasons:

It is Pythonic

Easy to Learn

Higher Developer Productivity

Dynamic Approach for Graph computation - AutoGrad

GPU Support for computation, and much more...

In this course,  We are going to implement Step by Step approach of learning:

Understand Basics of PyTorch

Learn to Code in GPU & with guide to access free GPU for learning

Learn Auto Grad feature of PyTorch

Implement Deep Learning models in Pytorch

Learn the Basics of Convolutional Neural Networks in PyTorch(CNN)

Practical Application of CNN's on Real World Dataset

We believe that,

Learning will not be complete, untill you as a student has the confidence on the Subject.

So,

We have added Assignments at the end of each Section so that you can measure your progress along with learning.

We look forward to see you inside the course.

All the best.

‚úÖWhat is C++ Programming? 
C++ is an enhanced and extended version of the C programming language, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 as part of his Ph.D. project. Bjarne developed what he called ‚ÄòC with Classes‚Äô (later renamed C++) because he felt limited by the existing programming languages that were not ideal for large scale projects. He used C to build what he wanted because C was already a general-purpose language that was efficient and fast in its operations.

‚úÖC++ Career Prospects:
With just C++ programming expertise, you will have excellent job opportunities, salaries, and career prospects. However, for a career based on programming languages such as Java and Python (which are in more demand than C++) or for careers based on front-end, back-end, and full-stack development, you will go a lot further with C++ expertise. Furthermore, in development domains such as software testing, you are expected to know C++.

Our brain is programmed to look for specific attributes ...,,98,1,0,0,11.0,"When trying to tell stories through data it is important to know how the brain and human cognition works.  

Our brain is programmed to look for specific attributes when looking at visualizations. Information that has the highest salience (a stimulus that stands out the most) or relevance to what a person is thinking about is selected for further and more complete analysis by conscious (attentive) processing. The most successful products and services are designed to make sure that you have the most important information right in front of you. Such as vehicles ‚Äì everything to properly operate a vehicle is right there. Every few minutes things are entering our brain and things are leaving ‚Äì so the information we are retaining becomes very important.  

Graphics are cognitive tools that extend what our brain remembers. Irrelevant information is removed from our brains and replaced with new information every second. So, focusing the user effectively on the data you want them to see avoids competition.  

So when designing visualizations and dashboards you can use signal techniques such as color, shape, tilt, arrow, angle, fade in, blink, blur, bold, size, etc. when creating visualizations to help highlight your story properly.  

Since our brain is programmed to look for specific attribute consider these 7 (from most effective to least effective) when expressing and encoding data in a visualization:  

 - 2D Position  
 - Length 
 - Angle 
 - Added Marks 
 - Area 
 - Color & Texture 
 - Volume

However, this cannot be further from the truth. There exists a pretty sizable amount of non-technical roles in ai & ml. Additionally we can expect to see more and more non-technical roles as more companies adopt AI. This is because an entire ecosystem of professionals in business, law, finance and much more need to exist in AI & ML. Machine learning engineers are significant people but they are not the only people running the show, all of these other professionals play a huge part too. 

In the video, I highlight 9 different types of roles that exist within a machine learning product ecosystem; 
0:00 Availability of non-technical roles in machine learning & AI
1:51 AI/ML Business Development Expert
3:30 AI/ML Product engineers:
4:18 AI/ML Managers
5:01 Data Collection & Management
5:40 Data Engineers
6:10 ML engineers
6:33 MLops
7:26 AI/ML Sales Team
8:18 AI/ML Product Support 

It‚Äôs important to understand that ‚Äúnon-technical‚Äù people have big roles available in AI & ML. Infact, the biggest take away from this video should be that, in order to land these types of roles, you need to understand the impact that AI has on the world, software, and other types of product. You need to be a proponent to build great products that make use of machine learning & artificial intelligence. You do not need to know how to write machine learning code or even understand machine learning algorithms.

Abstract: 
Building accurate forecasting models for economic indicators is a research area that many policy researchers work on. Traditional time series forecasting methods such as autoregressive moving average (ARMA) models often lead to unsatisfactory results. In this project, we exploit machine learning and deep learning techniques to forecast unemployment rate. We use three months of data to predict the following one month. Using linear regression as a baseline model, we compare results from random forests, XGBoost, and long short-term memory. There are two variants in all models: one uses 11 relevant economic indicators as input features, while another uses unemployment rate as the only feature. Both mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are used as evaluation metrics. We exclude year 2020 to control for noise from the COVID-19 pandemic. Among models that utilize all 11 features, XGBoost gives the best performance with MSE of 0.055. Among mod- els that use unemployment rate as the only feature, baseline linear regression performs the best. This could be due to the single-step forecasting structure in our models which is a relatively simple task compared to multiple-step forecast- ing. In addition, we test our models on year 2020 to see their performance during unusual time, we find XGBoost and LSTM to perform the best in the variant that uses all 11 features.",Presentation,Autoregressive-Moving-Average (ARMA) Model; Deep Learning; Economic Indications; Economics; Exploit; Linear Regression; Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM); Machine Learning; Moving Average; Nonlinear Regression; Presentation; Random Forest; Regression; Research; Time Series Forecasting

We used the J, M, and V letter datasets for a #classification task in the previous blog at https://mlhp.link/BlogClassificationML/ We performed the classification by directly coding. Now let us see how we can do it in the Classification Learner app. In coding, we used only the #KNN method, and we did not try to improve accuracy. But in the app, we can use Classification Learner to train models of these classifiers: decision trees, discriminant analysis, support vector machines, logistic regression, nearest neighbors, naive Bayes, and ensemble classification. In addition to training models, we can explore the data, select features, specify validation schemes, and evaluate results. We can export a model to the workspace to use the model with new data or generate MATLAB code to learn about programmatic classification. Watch this video or read blog to understand better.

In this video, I explain what is horizontal analysis and how to perform the analysis to compare two or more periods, in Microsoft Excel. The example income statement I use is a real life example of the income statement or profit and loss statement of Coca Cola company. So, these are real numbers we are looking at. We will look at how to calculate the changes in amounts and how the percentage change is calculated when performing horizontal analysis. Then we look at each income statement line item and one by one try to understand the performance, and identify the positives and negatives, ask questions to help understand the performance better.

I have not looked at any back up information before performing the analysis. The idea is to share how to view and analyse income statement to understand performance and ask relevant questions to identify more details. 

Follow me as I calculate variances in amounts and percentages, and explain what they represent. Then I ask questions and make recommendations based on the analysis performed. I have seen this analysis done incorrectly in the past, so I try to share my thoughts from my practical experience of a horizontal analysis as it would be done in a real life workplace.

-----------------------------------

Now, let‚Äôs cover the autoregressive model.The autoregressive model uses a linear combination of past values of the target to make a prediction. Since we are talking about autoregression, the regression is made against the target itself. 

We refer to the autoregressive model as the AR(p) model, where p is the order.The AR(p) model is very flexible in the sense that it can model many different types of time series patterns. However, keep in mind that the autoregressive model can only be applied to stationary time series, which will constrain the range of the parameters phi.

If we look at the ACF plot, we see some oscillation, as well as a slow decay. This is a hint that it is not a moving average process, and so an autoregressive process must be in play. Now, when we look at the PACF, the partial autocorrelation function plot, then we see that there is no significant peak after lag 2. Therefore, the PACF can be used to determine the order of the AR model.As a side note, the PACF or partial autocorrelation function finds the correlation between the present value and the residuals at a previous lag. Therefore, it finds a correlation that cannot be explained with the ACF.

To recap, if you plot the ACF and you see a decay or a sinusoidal pattern, then it suggests an autoregressive process.Plotting the PACF will allow you to estimate the order of the AR model. In this case, we saw that it is of order 2, since after lag 2, the coefficients are not significant.",Time Series Analysis,Augmented Reality (AR); Autocorrelation (ACF); Autoregressive (AR) Model; Correlation; Dataset; Email; Github; Moving Average; Partial Autocorrelation (PACF); Play; Python; Regression; TensorFlow; Time Series Analysis; Tree

You will learn how to query database systems via languages such as SQL (the structured query language). Then, you will see how database systems work internally, how they store and index data, how they process and optimize queries, and how they process transactions while providing guarantees such as isolation, atomicity, and durability (ACID guarantees).

The course addresses questions of database design and discusses novel approaches to data management via NoSQL or NewSQL systems. Finally, the course will discuss about graph, stream, and spatial data, and about systems that are specialized for those data types. The lectures are from the Fall 2020 online lecture at Cornell by Prof. Trummer (www.itrummer.org).

Customer Review:

Michael Harkins, System Architect, Hortonworks says: ‚ÄúThe courses are top rate. The best part is live instruction, with playback. But my favourite feature is viewing a previous class. Also, they are always there to answer questions, and prompt when you open an issue if you are having any trouble. Added bonus ~ you get lifetime access to the course you took!!! ~ This is the killer education app...

But, you can also create your own data type from any supported data source by using Power Query. With this new feature, you can create custom data types and you can view the data in an Excel table, display it as an easy-to-read card, or use it in formulas. Power Query doesn't have a hyperlink data type, but you can create hyperlinks using data from Power Query by following the steps I show in the video. This way your Power Query results will be hyperlinked and clickable.

We'll use Power Query custom data types to create a free library of all my YouTube tutorials in Excel. I'll also show you a great trick in Power Query to return clickable hyperlinks with friendly names to Excel.

This is a Free Course by Manifold AI Learning on Youtube

With the Deep learning making the breakthrough in all the fields of science and technology, Deep Learning Computer Vision is the field which is picking up at the faster rate where we see the applications in most of the applications out there.

Be it, Facebook's image tagging feature, Google Photo's People Recognition along with Scenery detection, Fraud detection, Facial Recognition, We are seeing the Deep Learning Computer Vision Applications out there. 

A typical task in Deep Learning Computer vision task will include the methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of these high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, with which we can form decisions.

A typical & basic operation we perform is - Convolution Operations on Images, where we try to learn the representations of the image so that the computer can learn the most of the data from the input images.

In this course,

We will be learning one of the widely used Deep Learning Framework, i.e PyTorch

It is said as,

PyTorch to be Goto Tool for DeepLearning for Product Prototypes as well as Academia.

We are going to prefer learning - PyTorch for these Reasons:

It is Pythonic

Easy to Learn

Higher Developer Productivity

Dynamic Approach for Graph computation - AutoGrad

GPU Support for computation, and much more...

In this course,  We are going to implement Step by Step approach of learning:

Understand Basics of PyTorch

Learn to Code in GPU & with guide to access free GPU for learning

Learn Auto Grad feature of PyTorch

Implement Deep Learning models in Pytorch

Learn the Basics of Convolutional Neural Networks in PyTorch(CNN)

Practical Application of CNN's on Real World Dataset

We believe that,

Learning will not be complete, untill you as a student has the confidence on the Subject.

So,

We have added Assignments at the end of each Section so that you can measure your progress along with learning.

We look forward to see you inside the course.

All the best.

**Abstract**
Intelligent agents rely heavily on prior experience when learning a new task, yet most modern reinforcement learning (RL) approaches learn every task from scratch. One approach for leveraging prior knowledge is to transfer skills learned on prior tasks to the new task. However, as the amount of prior experience increases, the number of transferable skills grows too, making it challenging to explore the full set of available skills during downstream learning. Yet, intuitively, not all skills should be explored with equal probability; for example information about the current state can hint which skills are promising to explore. In this work, we propose to implement this intuition by learning a prior over skills. We propose a deep latent variable model that jointly learns an embedding space of skills and the skill prior from offline agent experience. We then extend common maximum-entropy RL approaches to use skill priors to guide downstream learning. We validate our approach, SPiRL (Skill-Prior RL), on complex navigation and robotic manipulation tasks and show that learned skill priors are essential for effective skill transfer from rich datasets.""",Reinforcement,Dataset; Github; Probability; Reinforcement Learning; Robotics; Variable

‚úÖWhat is C++ Programming? 
C++ is an enhanced and extended version of C programming language, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 as part of his Ph.D. project. Bjarne developed what he called ‚ÄòC with Classes‚Äô (later renamed C++) because he felt limited by the existing programming languages that were not ideal for large scale projects. He used C to build what he wanted because C was already a general-purpose language that was efficient and fast in its operations. C++ is populary used to build real-world applications such as Operating systems, GUI based applications, Database software and Banking applications

‚úÖC++ Career Prospects:
With just C++ programming expertise, you will have excellent job opportunities, salaries, and career prospects. However, for a career based on programming languages such as Java and Python (which are in more demand than C++) or for careers based on front-end, back-end, and full-stack development, you will go a lot further with C++ expertise. Furthermore, in development domains such as software testing, you are expected to know C++.

üíª Abstract:
AI In The Multiverse Measuring ROI When AB Tests Are Not Possible. A.I. services are deployed to produce improvements to important business metrics, e.g. customer engagement, number of transactions, total profits. When evaluating the contribution of a new service, it is crucial to be able to answer the attribution question: how much of my target outcome would have been achieved even in the absence of the A.I. model? Causal assessments are usually done through A/B tests, which however are not always feasible: who would switch off Amazon recommendations entirely to do such an assessment? In this talk, we show how to use A.I. to assess A.I. contributions to revenues in eCommerce: in particular, we will show how deep learning models can be used to assess how much revenues in a digital shop comes from interactions with search and recommendation APIs. Our findings can be generalized to many other settings, to assess and monitor the performance of existing ML pipelines even in the absence of A/B testing.

üîä Speaker bio:
Jacopo Tagliabue- Lead A.I. Scientist, Coveo
Educated in several acronyms across the globe (UNISR, SFI, MIT), Jacopo was founder and CTO of Tooso, an A.I. company based in San Francisco: Tooso was named ""Gartner Cool Vendor"" in 2019 and acquired by Canadian unicorn Coveo in the same year. Jacopo is currently the Lead A.I. Scientist at Coveo, building A.I. products for a network of more than 400 customers, including several Fortune 500 companies. Together with his team, he combines product thinking with technical innovation on a variety of topics, presenting original findings at major conferences (KDD, HCOMP, ACL, ECAI, RecSys, etc.). In previous lives, he managed to get a Ph.D., do sciency things for a pro basketball team, and simulate a pre-Columbian civilization.

Machine learning is a core sub-area of artificial intelligence; it enables computers to get into a mode of self-learning without being explicitly programmed. When exposed to new data, these computer programs are enabled to learn, grow, change, and develop by themselves. So, put simply, the iterative aspect of machine learning is the ability to adapt to new data independently. This is possible as programs learn from previous computations and use ‚Äúpattern recognition‚Äù to produce reliable results. 

R is a widely popular programming language in the field of machine learning. R is an open-source programming language used for statistical computing. It is one of the most popular programming languages today. R was inspired by S+, which is similar to the S programming language. R has various data structures and operators. It can be integrated with other programming languages like C, C++, Java, and Python.

‚úÖWhat is C++ Programming? 
C++ is an enhanced and extended version of the C programming language, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 as part of his Ph.D. project. Bjarne developed what he called ‚ÄòC with Classes‚Äô (later renamed C++) because he felt limited by the existing programming languages that were not ideal for large scale projects. He used C to build what he wanted because C was already a general-purpose language that was efficient and fast in its operations.

‚úÖC++ Career Prospects:
With just C++ programming expertise, you will have excellent job opportunities, salaries, and career prospects. However, for a career based on programming languages such as Java and Python (which are in more demand than C++) or for careers based on front-end, back-end, and full-stack development, you will go a lot further with C++ expertise. Furthermore, in development domains such as software testing, you are expected to know C++.

More details:
In our fourth session, we'll dig into some of the math behind multiple linear regression. While there are a number of Python modules that allow us to fit a model without understanding this math, it is difficult to troubleshoot, interpret, and learn new technologies without it. This session will give you enough understanding to accomplish these things, while still bypassing detailed algebra and calculus!

Artificial Intelligence/Machine learning does not only mean robots or Sci-Fi movies!

Machine learning applications are everywhere! Google search engine, amazon recommender systems, Facebook facial recognition (tagging), Siri.

Artificial Intelligence: Science that empowers computers to mimic human intelligence such as decision making, text processing, and visual perception. 
AI is a broader field (i.e.: the big umbrella) that contains several subfield such as machine learning, robotics, and computer vision. 


Machine Learning: Machine Learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence that enables machines to improve at a given task with experience. 
It is important to note that all machine learning techniques are classified as Artificial Intelligence ones. However, not all Artificial Intelligence could count as Machine Learning since some basic Rule-based engines could be classified as AI but they do not learn from experience therefore they do not belong to the machine learning category.


Deep Learning: Deep Learning is a specialized field of Machine Learning that relies on training of Deep Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) using large dataset such as images. 
ANNs are information processing models inspired by the human brain.
The human brain consists of billions of neurons that communicate to each other using electrical and chemical signals and enable humans to see, feel, and make decision.

What is Power BI?
When looking for the answer to ‚ÄúWhat is Power BI?‚Äù, we need to look no further than the tool‚Äôs creator, Microsoft. The company defines Power BI as ‚Äú‚Ä¶a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights.‚Äù The BI stands for ‚Äúbusiness intelligence,‚Äù and the tool gives non-technical users all the resources they need to aggregate, visualize, analyze, and share data. The business world considers Power BI one of the best drag-and-drop tools available in the industry today.

Talk #1: Top challenges and considerations for adopting Machine Learning at Scale by Shelbee Eigenbrode, Principal AI and Machine Learning Specialist Solutions Architect, AWS

In this session, we will talk about the top challenges organizations run into when adopting machine learning at scale.
As organizations complete their first few successful prototypes and begin to realize the benefits of using machine learning to drive business outcomes, the next question is usually ‚ÄúHow can we adopt and scale our machine learning strategy to drive more business outcomes?‚Äù. To address this question, we‚Äôll address the top challenges and considerations when approaching these challenges. We‚Äôll discuss choosing the right projects and MLOps among other topics in this session.

Talk #2: Hierarchical Forecasting with scikit-hts and Amazon SageMaker by Mani Khanuja and Farooq Sabir, Senior Solution Architects for AI/ML @ AWS

Time series forecasting is a very common and well known problem in machine learning and statistics. Most of the times, the time series data follows a hierarchical aggregation structure. For e.g. in retail, weekly sales for a SKU at a store can roll up to different geographical hierarchies at city, state or country level. In these cases we need to ensure, that the sales estimates are in agreement, when rolled up to a higher level.

In such scenarios, Hierarchical Time Series Forecasting, which is the process of generating coherent forecasts (or reconciling incoherent forecasts), allowing individual time series to be forecast individually, but preserving the relationships within the hierarchy, is used.
Many customers are either using hierarchical forecasting methods or have an upcoming use case that requires hierarchical forecasting to achieve better results. In this session, we will demonstrate, how to set up data for hierarchical forecasting, and use Prophet model to carry out forecasting using SageMaker framework and features.

However, when such trial and error learning needs to happen in the real world, it can often be costly and furthermore learning can destabilize. In this talk I will discuss new approaches towards satisfying (safety) constraints during learning and ensuring stable learning progress.

SPEAKER: Pieter Abbeel is a Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Berkeley. He strives to build ever more intelligent systems.

MongoDB Interview Questions & Answers - learn MongoDB
What you will learn in this course ?

Uplatz brings you this training on the most commonly asked interview questions and answers on MongoDB.By learning and understanding deeply the popular interview questions (with answers) of MongoDB, you can confidently apply for Web Developer / Mongo Programmer / Full Stack Engineer (MERN, MEAN stacks) / Database Developer roles.This course explains the solutions to common questions asked in the recent MongoDB Programmer and Web Developer interviews and comes with a freely downloadable booklet on the same.MongoDB¬†interview questions tutorial will help you crack the job interviews which can be a turning point in your career!With these top hand-picked MongoDB interview questions, you will be able to gain sound knowledge on MongoDB concepts and their application. As part of these interview questions, you will understand the detailed structure of MongoDB, what its different applications are, how to create a schema in MongoDB, what splitting is, sharding and aggregation in Mongo database, and many more.
BackgroundMongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database used for high volume data storage. MongoDB is a database which came into light around the mid-2000s. It falls under the category of a NoSQL database. In other words, MongoDB is an open-source document-based database management tool that stores data in JSON-like formats. It is a highly scalable, flexible, and distributed NoSQL database.With the rise in data all around the world, there has been an observable and increasing interest surrounding the wave of the non-relational database, also known as ‚ÄòNoSQL‚Äò. Businesses and organisations are seeking new methods to manage the flood of data and are drawn toward the alternate database management tools and systems that are different from the traditional relational database systems. Here comes MongoDB into the picture.
Some of the key features of MongoDB¬†are:Each database contains collections which in turn contains documents. Each document can be different with a varying number of fields. The size and content of each document can be different from each other.The document structure is more in line with how developers construct their classes and objects in their respective programming languages. Developers will often say that their classes are not rows and columns but have a clear structure with key-value pairs.As seen in the introduction with NoSQL databases, the rows (or documents as called in MongoDB) doesn't need to have a schema defined beforehand. Instead, the fields can be created on the fly.The data model available within MongoDB allows you to represent hierarchical relationships, to store arrays, and other more complex structures more easily.Scalability - The MongoDB environments are very scalable. Companies across the world have defined clusters with some of them running 100+ nodes with around millions of documents within the databaseQueries: It supports ad-hoc queries and document-based queries.Index Support: Any field in the document can be indexed.Replication: It supports Master‚ÄìSlave replication. MongoDB uses native application to maintain multiple copies of data. Preventing database downtime is one of the replica set‚Äôs features as it has self-healing shard.Multiple Servers: The database can run over multiple servers. Data is duplicated to foolproof the system in the case of hardware failure.Auto-sharding: This process distributes data across multiple physical partitions called shards. Due to sharding, MongoDB has an automatic load balancing feature.MapReduce: It supports MapReduce and flexible aggregation tools.Failure Handling: In MongoDB, it‚Äôs easy to cope with cases of failures. Huge numbers of replicas give out increased protection and data availability against database downtime like rack failures, multiple machine failures, and data center failures, or even network partitions.GridFS: Without complicating your stack, any sizes of files can be stored. GridFS feature divides files into smaller parts and stores them as separate documents.Schema-less Database: It is a schema-less database written in C++.Document-oriented Storage: It uses BSON format which is a JSON-like format.Procedures: MongoDB JavaScript works well as the database uses the language instead of procedures.
MongoDB¬†Interview Questions (some examples)Some of the popular MongoDB¬†interview questions asked in Full Stack Developer job interviews are:
What is MongoDB?MongoDB is a document-based database which is highly scalable and offers better performance.

In the new Netflix Original Over the Moon (https://www.netflix.com/title/80214236), Fei Fei builds a rocket to fly to the Moon to meet the Moon Goddess Chang‚Äôe. It is said that when Chang‚Äôe cries, her tears are the shooting starts we see in our night sky. This inspired Dr G to deep dive into what meteor showers actually are and how they are predicted. Join this live stream as Dr G explores how data science plays a role in predicting celestial events, and even brings in a little magic from the film to predict when we could have seen the meteor shower caused by Chang‚Äôe from Fei Fei‚Äôs visit. No coding experience required, and you can follow along with the free Microsoft Learn lessons at https://aka.ms/LearnWithDrG/OverTheMoon.

Phil Winder - Phil masters the hard art of backing theory by real-life experience. There is always more to learn about data and reinforcement learning

ABSTRACT
Reinforcement learning (RL), a sub-discipline of machine learning, has been gaining academic and media notoriety after hyped marketing ""reveals"" of agents playing various games. But these hide the fact that RL is immensely useful in many practical, industrial situations where hand-coding strategies or policies would be impractical or sub-optimal.
Following the theme of Phil's new book Reinforcement Learning, Phil will present a rebuttal to the hyperbole by analyzing five different industrial case studies from a variety of sectors.
You will learn where RL can be applied, how to spot challenges that fit inside the RL paradigm [...]

Supervised learning is a type of Machine Learning which learns from the labelled data.

A data which has a particular label or value assigned to it, is a labelled data.

As we are already providing the right answer, we can say that the model is learning under our supervision. Thus we call it Supervised Learning.

There are two types of Supervised Learning :
1. Classification
2. Regression

With the Deep learning making the breakthrough in all the fields of science and technology, Deep Learning Computer Vision is the field which is picking up at the faster rate where we see the applications in most of the applications out there.

Be it, Facebook's image tagging feature, Google Photo's People Recognition along with Scenery detection, Fraud detection, Facial Recognition, We are seeing the Deep Learning Computer Vision Applications out there. 

A typical task in Deep Learning Computer vision task will include the methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of these high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, with which we can form decisions.

A typical & basic operation we perform is - Convolution Operations on Images, where we try to learn the representations of the image so that the computer can learn the most of the data from the input images.

In this course,

We will be learning one of the widely used Deep Learning Framework, i.e PyTorch

It is said as,

PyTorch to be Goto Tool for DeepLearning for Product Prototypes as well as Academia.

We are going to prefer learning - PyTorch for these Reasons:

It is Pythonic

Easy to Learn

Higher Developer Productivity

Dynamic Approach for Graph computation - AutoGrad

GPU Support for computation, and much more...

In this course,  We are going to implement Step by Step approach of learning:

Understand Basics of PyTorch

Learn to Code in GPU & with guide to access free GPU for learning

Learn Auto Grad feature of PyTorch

Implement Deep Learning models in Pytorch

Learn the Basics of Convolutional Neural Networks in PyTorch(CNN)

Practical Application of CNN's on Real World Dataset

We believe that,

Learning will not be complete, untill you as a student has the confidence on the Subject.

So,

We have added Assignments at the end of each Section so that you can measure your progress along with learning.

We look forward to see you inside the course.

All the best.

The classical Linear regression model is one of the important cornerstones of econometrics. It is important to understand the concepts and get hold of important areas.
The estimators that we create through linear regression give us a relationship between the variables. However, performing a regression does not automatically give us a reliable relationship between the variables. In order to create reliable relationships, we must know the properties of the estimators and show that some basic assumptions about the data are true. One must understand that having a good dataset is of enormous importance for applied economic research.
The estimation and hypothesis testing are the twin branches of statistical inference. Based on the OLS, we obtained the sample regression, such as the one shown in Equation.

About the course:
This is a Free Course by Manifold AI Learning on Youtube

With the Deep learning making the breakthrough in all the fields of science and technology, Deep Learning Computer Vision is the field which is picking up at the faster rate where we see the applications in most of the applications out there.

Be it, Facebook's image tagging feature, Google Photo's People Recognition along with Scenery detection, Fraud detection, Facial Recognition, We are seeing the Deep Learning Computer Vision Applications out there. 

A typical task in Deep Learning Computer vision task will include the methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of these high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, with which we can form decisions.

A typical & basic operation we perform is - Convolution Operations on Images, where we try to learn the representations of the image so that the computer can learn the most of the data from the input images.

In this course,

We will be learning one of the widely used Deep Learning Framework, i.e PyTorch

It is said as,

PyTorch to be Goto Tool for DeepLearning for Product Prototypes as well as Academia.

We are going to prefer learning - PyTorch for these Reasons:

It is Pythonic

Easy to Learn

Higher Developer Productivity

Dynamic Approach for Graph computation - AutoGrad

GPU Support for computation, and much more...

In this course,  We are going to implement Step by Step approach of learning:

Understand Basics of PyTorch

Learn to Code in GPU & with guide to access free GPU for learning

Learn Auto Grad feature of PyTorch

Implement Deep Learning models in Pytorch

Learn the Basics of Convolutional Neural Networks in PyTorch(CNN)

Practical Application of CNN's on Real World Dataset

We believe that,

Learning will not be complete, untill you as a student has the confidence on the Subject.

So,

We have added Assignments at the end of each Section so that you can measure your progress along with learning.

We look forward to see you inside the course.

All the best.

It's a difficult question and, although I am biased towards Excel VBA, I can see both side of the argument, at least to some extent!  In this video, we discuss 7 questions you should answer to work out if Excel / Excel VBA is for you, or not.

As we'll see, whether you should learn Excel / Excel VBA or not depends on a few things, including your occupation, if you are doing analysis for yourself or for others, and the kind of organisation you work for.

Somebody who is under-represented in the debate is not the data specialist, but the general professional.  I have seen plenty of data analysts, scientists and other data professionals talking (largely negatively) about Excel and Excel VBA; but what about the typical professional?  The millions of people who have to work with data everyday, but don't wish to specialise in data as a job.  

The needs of these people who really need help, in my view, are somewhat excluded from the debate. As I try to bring out in the video, Excel is suited to them because of its affordability, practicality and versatility.

At a deeper level, Excel is the way forward for data analysis precisely because of its ubiquity and popularity. This may irk some data scientists out there, but the future of data analysis lies in generalisation, not specialisation.  This is because, like it or not, millions of non-specialists across the world are creating their own analytical tools already - most of the time in Excel.

Rather than moving to other less accessible and more obscure platforms, I would suggest we embrace this trend and seek to engage, educate and encourage better practice, rather than retreating to our ivory towers full of specialist tools in academia or the data analysis department.",Excel,Analytical; Data Analysis; LeSS; Microsoft Excel; Platform; Rally; Video; Visual Basic For Applications (VBA)

    Big Data and Data Science Foundation to empower you with the most specialized skills   The core concepts are stressed upon and the focus is on building a solid foundation of the key Hadoop, Map Reduce and collaborative filtering concepts upon which you can learn just about every other technology in the same space. Preliminary Java and Unix knowledge is expected.   Contents & Overview   Through 47 lectures and 8 hours of content, we will take a step-by step approach to understanding Big Data and related concepts from scratch.   The first few topics will focus on the rise of Big Data and how Apache Hadoop fits in. We will focus on the fundamentals of Hadoop and its core components: HDFS and Map Reduce. We will then setup and play around with Hadoop and HDFS and then deep dive into MapReduce programming with hands on examples. We will also spend time on Combiners and Partitioners and how they can help. We will also spend time on Hadoop Streaming: a tool that helps non-Java professionals to leverage the power of Hadoop and do POCs on it.   Once we have a solid foundation of HDFS and MapReduce, in the next couple of topics we will explore higher level components of the Hadoop ecosystem: Hive and Pig. We will go into the details of both Hive and Pig by installing them and working with examples. Hive and Pig can make your life easy by shielding you from the complexity of writing MR jobs and yet leveraging the parallel processing ability of the Hadoop framework.   In the next few lectures we will look at something very interesting: Apache Mahout and Machine Learning. Apache Mahout is a Java library that lets you write machine learning applications with ease. We will learn the basics of Machine Learning and go deeper into Collaborative Filtering and recommender systems, something that Mahout excels that.   We will look at some similarity algorithms, understand their real-life implications and apply them when we will build together a real world movie recommender system using Mahout and Hadoop.   After taking this course, which includes slides, examples, code and data sets, you will be at ease with playing aroundwith HDFS, writing MapReduce jobs, analyzing data with Hive and Pig, and building a recommender system using Apache Mahout.

Types of Visualizations - Essential Design Principles for Tableau
Data Visualization with Tableau Specialization
In this course, you will analyze and apply essential design principles to your Tableau visualizations. This course assumes you understand the tools within Tableau and have some knowledge of the fundamental concepts of data visualization. You will define and examine the similarities and differences of exploratory and explanatory analysis as well as begin to ask the right questions about what‚Äôs needed in a visualization. You will assess how data and design work together, including how to choose the appropriate visual representation for your data, and the difference between effective and ineffective visuals. You will apply effective best practice design principles to your data visualizations and be able to illustrate examples of strategic use of contrast to highlight important elements. You will evaluate pre-attentive attributes and why they are important in visualizations. You will exam the importance of using the right amount of color and in the right place and be able to apply design principles to de-clutter your data visualization.

Good introduction to Tableau essentials. I enjoy the step by step instructions on creating analytics in Tableau. Receiving a year long subscritpion to the license is also AMAZING,It is an excellent course!!! very well designed and very proficient talk on most difficult and most important skills related to data visualization....Enjoyed it sooo much!!!
Welcome to this first module where we are going to start you off with background information about how the human brain perceives the world and then you will discover effective and ineffective visuals. By the end of this module, you will be able to recognize how the brain relates to visual design. You will know the difference between cognitive versus perceptual design. You will learn the various visualization options offered by Tableau and some of their advantages and disadvantages. You will discuss why how good ethical practices play in designing visualizations. You will also start to examine ineffective visualizations and learn how to improve them.

This is a Free Course by Manifold AI Learning on Youtube

With the Deep learning making the breakthrough in all the fields of science and technology, Deep Learning Computer Vision is the field which is picking up at the faster rate where we see the applications in most of the applications out there.

Be it, Facebook's image tagging feature, Google Photo's People Recognition along with Scenery detection, Fraud detection, Facial Recognition, We are seeing the Deep Learning Computer Vision Applications out there. 

A typical task in Deep Learning Computer vision task will include the methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of these high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, with which we can form decisions.

A typical & basic operation we perform is - Convolution Operations on Images, where we try to learn the representations of the image so that the computer can learn the most of the data from the input images.

In this course,

We will be learning one of the widely used Deep Learning Framework, i.e PyTorch

It is said as,

PyTorch to be Goto Tool for DeepLearning for Product Prototypes as well as Academia.

We are going to prefer learning - PyTorch for these Reasons:

It is Pythonic

Easy to Learn

Higher Developer Productivity

Dynamic Approach for Graph computation - AutoGrad

GPU Support for computation, and much more...

In this course,  We are going to implement Step by Step approach of learning:

Understand Basics of PyTorch

Learn to Code in GPU & with guide to access free GPU for learning

Learn Auto Grad feature of PyTorch

Implement Deep Learning models in Pytorch

Learn the Basics of Convolutional Neural Networks in PyTorch(CNN)

Practical Application of CNN's on Real World Dataset

We believe that,

Learning will not be complete, untill you as a student has the confidence on the Subject.

So,

We have added Assignments at the end of each Section so that you can measure your progress along with learning.

We look forward to see you inside the course.

All the best.

F2z5iP9EcnI,Introduction to GPU Computing with MATLAB,MATLAB,https://youtube.com/watch?v=F2z5iP9EcnI,2021-04-08T13:15:01Z,Explore MATLAB GPU Computing Support for NVIDIA CUDA-Enabled GPUs: https://bit.ly/2Nb7Olf GPU computing is a widely adopted technology that uses the ...,en-US,33849,620,10,65,41.0,"Explore MATLAB GPU Computing Support for NVIDIA CUDA-Enabled GPUs: https://bit.ly/2Nb7Olf
GPU computing is a widely adopted technology that uses the power of GPUs to accelerate computationally intensive workflows. Since 2010, Parallel Computing Toolbox has provided GPU Computing support for MATLAB.

Although GPUs were originally developed for graphics rendering, they are now used generally to accelerate applications in fields such as scientific computing, engineering, artificial intelligence, and financial analysis.

Using Parallel Computing Toolbox, you can leverage NVIDIA GPUs to accelerate your application directly from MATLAB.

MATLAB provides a direct interface for accelerating computationally intensive workflows on GPUs for over 500 functions.

Using these supported functions, you can execute your code on a GPU without needing any CUDA programming experience. For computationally intensive problems, it‚Äôs possible to achieve significant speedup making only a few changes to your existing code.

With GPU support in Parallel Computing Toolbox, it‚Äôs easy to determine if you can use a GPU to speed up your application.

If your code includes GPU supported functions, converting your inputs to GPU arrays will automatically execute those functions on your GPU. MATLAB automatically handles GPU resource allocation, so you can focus on your application without having to learn any low-level GPU computing tools.

If your code includes GPU supported functions, converting your inputs to GPU arrays will automatically execute those functions on your GPU. MATLAB automatically handles GPU resource allocation, so you can focus on your application without having to learn any low-level GPU computing tools.

You can use gpuBench from MathWorks File Exchange to compare performance of supported GPUs using standard numerical benchmarks in MATLAB.

Many MATLAB functions such as the trainNetwork function use any compatible GPUs by default. To train your model on multiple GPUs, you can simply change a training option directly in MATLAB.

If you don‚Äôt have access to a GPU on your laptop or workstation, you can leverage a MATLAB Reference Architecture to use one or more GPUs with a MATLAB desktop in the cloud.

You can also leverage the MATLAB Deep Learning Container for NVIDIA GPU Cloud which supports NVIDIA DGX and other platforms that support Docker.

If you have many GPU applications to run or need to scale beyond a single machine with GPUs, you can use MATLAB Parallel Server to extend your workflow to a cluster with GPUs. If you don‚Äôt already have access to a GPU cluster, you can leverage MathWorks Cloud Center or a MATLAB Parallel Server Reference Architecture.

Parallel Computing Toolbox provides additional features for working directly with CUDA code. The mexcuda function compiles CUDA code into a MEX-file that can be called directly in MATLAB as a function.

Conversely, after writing your MATLAB code, you can generate and deploy ready-to-use CUDA code with‚ÄØGPU Coder. The generated code is optimized to call standard CUDA libraries and can be integrated and deployed directly onto NVIDIA GPUs.

To learn more about how to take full advantage of your GPU in MATLAB, explore the GPU computing solutions page.

You can also explore the MathWorks documentation for a complete list of functions with GPU support and more examples.

LECTURE Part A: http://bit.ly/pDL-en-12-1
In this section we discuss the various architectures used in NLP applications, beginning with CNNs, RNNs, and eventually covering the state of-the art architecture, transformers. We then discuss the various modules that comprise transformers and how they make transformers advantageous for NLP tasks. Finally, we discuss tricks that allow transformers to be trained effectively.

0:13:48 ‚Äì Transformer language model structure and intuition
0:32:55 ‚Äì Some tricks and facts of Transformer Language Models and decoding Language Models

LECTURE Part B: http://bit.ly/pDL-en-12-2
In this section we introduce beam search as a middle ground between greedy decoding and exhaustive search. We consider the case of wanting to sample from the generative distribution (i.e. when generating text) and introduce ‚Äútop-k‚Äù sampling. Subsequently, we introduce sequence to sequence models (with a transformer variant) and back-translation. We then introduce unsupervised learning approaches for learning embeddings and discuss word2vec, GPT, and BERT.

Today, we have data present everywhere around us in the form of text, bills, photos, videos, messages etc. Hence, It's management has become really important. Today, we'll be discussing the Database Management System. This tutorial will introduce you to the basic functions that a Database Management System performs.

The database can be called a collection of data. A database usually contains one or more tables and we apply different functionalities to the records of this database. A Database Management System is system software for creating and managing these databases. SQL is the standard language for Database Management System. The major functions of a DBMS are storing, manipulating, defining and retrieving the data in databases.

In this tutorial, we will be teaching about Data Definition, Data Manipulation and Data Control. We‚Äôll also discuss how the data is extracted and fetched. Through various examples, we will teach you how to update, read, create, delete data in a database. We will use different techniques such as Joins and we will learn to use various other SQL functions as well. So, stay tuned and watch the video till the end.

Following pointers will be covered in this video:
00:00:00 Introduction
00:01:09 What is a Database?
00:01:23 Example of Databases
00:02:23 What is a Database Management System

Structured Database Management Systems (DBMS) based on relational and other models have long formed the basis for such databases. Consequently, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, Sybase etc. have emerged as leading commercial systems while MySQL, PostgreSQL etc. lead in open source and free domain.

While DBMS‚Äôs differ in the details, they share a common set of models, design paradigms and a Structured Query Language (SQL). In this background the course examines data structures, file organizations, concepts and principles of DBMS‚Äôs, data analysis, database design, data modeling, database management, data & query optimization, and database implementation. More specifically, the course introduces relational data models; entity-relationship modeling, SQL, data normalization, and database design. Further it introduces query coding practices using MySQL (or any other open system) through various assignments. Design of simple multi-tier client / server architectures based and Web-based database applications is also introduced.

We'll walk through a quick demo on Azure Synapse Analytics, an integrated platform for analytics within Microsoft Azure cloud. This short demo is meant for those who are curious about Spark with Python or just want to get a peek at Spark in Azure Synapse. If you are new to Apache Spark, just know that it is a popular framework for data engineers that can be run in a variety of environments. It is popular because it enables distributed data processing with a relatively simple API. If you want to see examples in Scala or C#, you can check out one of my other videos where I walk through a similar demo.

You can follow along to build a Spark data load that reads linked sample data, transforms data, joins to a lookup table, and saves as a Delta Lake file to your Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account. Please be aware that you will occur costs following this example. To keep costs minimal make the Spark pool small and keep default 15 minute auto-terminate setting.

About the course:
This is a Free Course by Manifold AI Learning on Youtube

With the Deep learning making the breakthrough in all the fields of science and technology, Deep Learning Computer Vision is the field which is picking up at the faster rate where we see the applications in most of the applications out there.

Be it, Facebook's image tagging feature, Google Photo's People Recognition along with Scenery detection, Fraud detection, Facial Recognition, We are seeing the Deep Learning Computer Vision Applications out there. 

A typical task in Deep Learning Computer vision task will include the methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of these high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, with which we can form decisions.

A typical & basic operation we perform is - Convolution Operations on Images, where we try to learn the representations of the image so that the computer can learn the most of the data from the input images.

In this course,

We will be learning one of the widely used Deep Learning Framework, i.e PyTorch

It is said as,

PyTorch to be Goto Tool for DeepLearning for Product Prototypes as well as Academia.

We are going to prefer learning - PyTorch for these Reasons:

It is Pythonic

Easy to Learn

Higher Developer Productivity

Dynamic Approach for Graph computation - AutoGrad

GPU Support for computation, and much more...

In this course,  We are going to implement Step by Step approach of learning:

Understand Basics of PyTorch

Learn to Code in GPU & with guide to access free GPU for learning

Learn Auto Grad feature of PyTorch

Implement Deep Learning models in Pytorch

Learn the Basics of Convolutional Neural Networks in PyTorch(CNN)

Practical Application of CNN's on Real World Dataset

We believe that,

Learning will not be complete, untill you as a student has the confidence on the Subject.

So,

We have added Assignments at the end of each Section so that you can measure your progress along with learning.

We look forward to see you inside the course.

All the best.

They work (mostly) and are a logical solution to your application's data management needs. They've been the standard and that's what's always worked. And then...NoSQL databases came along. You may find that you're now in a spiral of questions: What is this? Is this better than a relational database? What do we need another database technology for? Does this mean there's no structured query language? Do I migrate my existing database to this model? In this talk, I'll answer these questions (and many more) to help you understand the what, how, and why of NoSQL databases as it relates to the modern applications we strive to build today. You'll leave with a definitive guide on NoSQL databases and be confident in deciding whether or not it is the right database solution for you!

Learn Git and Github basics from Andrei Neagoie of Zero To Mastery. This in-depth tutorial will teach how to use Git and Github and walk you through you a full workflow. Github knowledge is something every developer should know. It's a key requirement for many employers and for contributing to open-source projects.

üíª Git commands you'll learn:

- Git clone
- Git status
- Git add
- Git commit
- Git push
- Git pull
- Git branch
- Git checkout

==========

‚è≤ Timestamps:

0:36 ‚Äì Source control
4:33 ‚Äì Set up your Github account
5:36 ‚Äì Start a new project on Github (Git clone, Git status, Git add, Git commit, Git push)
11:33 ‚Äì Accessing Github and working on a project on Github
14:27 ‚Äì Git pull
17:20 ‚Äì More advanced and real-life workflow example in Github
18:27 ‚Äì Git branch (`Main` branch was previously `Master branch` ‚Äì see note below)
22:46 ‚Äì Pull request
25:03 ‚Äì Merge conflict / Git checkout
34:01 ‚Äì Putting your project online using Github Pages

==========

üí° Github Renaming Update: `Master` is now `Main`

In the video, we talk about Github and branching. Recently Github has decided to rename the original branch from `master` to `main`. You can read more about why they did this here (main is less offensive than master): https://github.com/github/renaming

Therefore, any new Github repositories created from now on, you will have to use `main` instead of `master` (old ones will stay the same with `master` as the `main` branch). So anytime you see me use master, simply replace it with main!

Example üëá

If you see a command like ‚û° git push origin master
It should now be ‚û° git push origin main

==========

üí° My Terminal Setup

On your Bash profile, you can set it up so it shows git branches like you see in the video. Get the github branch to display in your prompt: https://gist.github.com/justintv/168835

Want access to your bash profile? Read this: https://www.quora.com/What-is-bash_profile-and-what-is-its-use

Since I use the Fish shell, my setup is a bit different.

We are going to be writing the data to a JSON flat file on the file system, but you might be loading your data into a database or data warehouse. The important part is that we are sending the transformed data to the destination we need it to be in order to utilize the data, which is the final stage of an ETL pipeline.

Why I don't recommend C++ for beginners // A lot of students learn C++ as their first language, and while I think it's a great language, I don't think it should be your first. The problem is that its abstractions are often leaky in non-intuitive ways. This video goes through one example of how beginning programmers can get messed up by Cpp.

In today‚Äôs video we are going over the top 5 online resources to learn Python!

When I first started to learn Python, there were a lot of free resources for Python programming. Now, a lot of free content has been replaced with courses that you have to pay money for. I am sure that these paid courses are really good, but I wanted to highlight the best free resources you could use to learn Python.

What I Recommend in the Video:

codecademy: (https://www.codecademy.com/)
w3schools: (https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp)
the official python tutorial: (https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) 
microsoft‚Äôs intro to python series: (https://youtu.be/jFCNu1-Xdsw)
automate the boring stuff with python:  (https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)

This workshop is part I in a series of three workshops. Throughout the series we will progress from introductory explanations of what a graph is, through the most common algorithms performed on graphs, and end with an investigation of the attributes of large-scale graphs using real data.

And in particular for Part I:
Graphs are structures that represent pairwise connections, and are used for everything from finding the shortest route between two locations to google‚Äôs page rank algorithm. Are you interested in learning about graph theory but don‚Äôt know where to start? In this workshop we will introduce graphs, develop comfort with their associated terminology, and investigate real-world applications with a focus on intuitive explanations and examples.

This workshop was conducted by Stanford ICME PhD student, Julia Olivieri.

#MachineLearningWithPython #MachineLearningTypes #MachineLearning #MachineLearningTutorial #MachineLearningCourse #MachineLearningAlgorithms #Simplilearn

What is Machine Learning?
A good start at a Machine Learning definition is that it is a core sub-area of Artificial Intelligence (AI). ML applications learn from experience (well data) like humans without direct programming. When exposed to new data, these applications learn, grow, change, and develop by themselves. 

What is Supervised Learning?
In supervised learning, we use known or labeled data for the training data. Since the data is known, the learning is, therefore, supervised, i.e., directed into successful execution. The input data goes through the Machine Learning algorithm and is used to train the model. 

What is Unsupervised Learning?
In unsupervised learning, the training data is unknown and unlabeled - meaning that no one has looked at the data before. Without the aspect of known data, the input cannot be guided to the algorithm, which is where the unsupervised term originates from.

What is Reinforcement Learning?
The algorithm discovers data through a process of trial and error and then decides what action results in higher rewards. Three major components make up reinforcement learning: the agent, the environment, and the actions. The agent is the learner or decision-maker, the environment includes everything that the agent interacts with, and the actions are what the agent does.

‚úÖWhat is C++ Programming? 
C++ is an enhanced and extended version of C programming language, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 as part of his PhD project. Bjarne developed what he called ‚ÄòC with Classes‚Äô (later renamed C++) because he felt limited by the existing programming languages that were not ideal for large scale projects. He used C to build what he wanted because C was already a general-purpose language that was efficient and fast in its operations.

‚úÖC++ Career Prospects:
With just C++ programming expertise, you will have excellent job opportunities, salaries, and career prospects. However, for a career based on programming languages such as Java and Python (which are in more demand than C++) or for careers based on front-end, back-end, and full-stack development, you will go a lot further with C++ expertise. Furthermore, in development domains such as software testing, you are expected to know C++.

But when it comes to GUI Programming, C++ wouldn't be the ideal choice for small developers who are building small-scale apps that don't require all that performance C++ offers. Also, coding GUI in C++ is quite hard (we all know how C++ programs look like compared to some other popular languages). So, here is my suggestion for those who are still using C++ to build GUI apps.

Now huge disclaimer, this videos is focused on the GUI side only. I am not talking about the general C++ applications.

How do you create a visualization that tells a story clearly and efficiently? How do researchers avoid importing their biases as they frame and communicate their research? How do different presentations of data either inform or obfuscate our questions, and our conclusions? Nicholas Marchio from the Mansueto Institute for Urban Innovation explores real-world problems facing Chicago and how data visualizations can help us uncover their solutions. The presentation introduces data visualization best practices and provide attendees with a ""start to finish"" recipe for creating their own publication quality maps and charts, including a data visualization toolbox, presentation tips, and much more.

The presentation was designed for attendees from all backgrounds and abilities; however, some introductory knowledge of the R programming language is beneficial.

Video #1 of my R tutorial series: https://youtu.be/6Z48qcrTfYU

In this video I go over my favorite resources for learning R.    I always recommend picking one of R or Python and mastering it - so ok, suppose you want to learn R, HOW exactly do you go about doing that?    There's a lot of paid courses out there, but unless you really want that certification, there are so many free resources that you don't need that.

Let‚Äôs cover the moving average model.

The moving average model is used for forecasting. It uses the past forecast errors to predict the next point in time. We refer to the moving average model as the MA(q) model, where q is the order.

Here, we see a simulation of a moving average process of order 2. We will do the same in Python

Then, we plot the ACF function. What do you notice? It seems that after lag 2, the autocorrelation is not significant anymore.

Now you know that we can use the ACF plot to estimate the order q of a moving average model! After lag q, the autocorrelation should not be significant anymore. Alright, now let‚Äôs run some simulations in Python and see this for ourselves!",Time Series Analysis,Autocorrelation (ACF); Email; Forecasting; Github; Moving Average; Python; TensorFlow; Time Series Analysis

ETL stands for Extract, Transform and Load, which are the three steps of the ETL process. ETL collects and processes data from various sources into a single data store (e.g., a data warehouse or data lake), making it much easier to analyze. In this video, we'll look at each piece of the extract, transform and load process and learn how to perform ETL. Learning ETL is crucial to become a data engineer and its one of the most in-demand skills of data engineering.

About me 

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

The first Project:Unbuilt competition: A Building's Essence
Visualization is a skill so intrinsic to an architect's daily task that this had to be the first theme! We took care of the design part by selecting 3 exemplars/iconic buildings. Our goal is to create a safe place to learn and practice visualization and representation skills, so why not share this process with the community, make it challenging, and possibly get some prizes at the end?

This competition platform is something that has was being developed for quite some time. I joined the team behind Arkitekturo to create well-crafted representation competitions. If you have any comments, questions, or suggestions, hit us up at competitions@projectunbuilt.com or over our Instagram @project.unbuilt

‚úÖWhat is C++ Programming? 
C++ is an enhanced and extended version of C programming language, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 as part of his Ph.D. project. Bjarne developed what he called ‚ÄòC with Classes‚Äô (later renamed C++) because he felt limited by the existing programming languages that were not ideal for large scale projects. He used C to build what he wanted because C was already a general-purpose language that was efficient and fast in its operations.

‚úÖC++ Career Prospects:
With just C++ programming expertise, you will have excellent job opportunities, salaries, and career prospects. However, for a career based on programming languages such as Java and Python (which are in more demand than C++) or for careers based on front-end, back-end, and full-stack development, you will go a lot further with C++ expertise. Furthermore, in development domains such as software testing, you are expected to know C++.

Data cleansing is crucial in the analytics and data science fields. In fact, there's a joke about this:

""Data Scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning data, and 20% complaining about it!""

Tableau, Machine Learning, Visualization, Prediction, etc. is really the fun part of the job. However, in order to do these things well, you need good quality data to use and in the real world, that's very rare to come by. In almost all cases, there are cleaning steps you need to do and that could include:

1. Filling nulls and gaps
2. Restructuring fields
3. Consolidating multiple sheets or various data sources
4. Correcting/rebuilding formulas
5. ..........and much more!!!!

In this case study, I'll show you some really basic techniques in how to clean merged data in Excel. There are other options/techniques in cleaning this so ultimately it comes down to personal preference.

Data cleansing or data cleaning is the process of detecting and correcting (or removing) corrupt or inaccurate records from a record set, table, or database and refers to identifying incomplete, incorrect, inaccurate or irrelevant parts of the data and then replacing, modifying, or deleting the dirty or coarse data. Data cleansing may be performed interactively with data wrangling tools, or as batch processing through scripting.

Water which contains 70% of our body - This is the element which creates our belief system -The reason it has such a large quantity as it carries a lot of information from our past genetics - It stores everything- So when we have malefics in the sign of Cancer, Scorpio or Pisces it shows nature wants us to remember that these were the blockages you are born with and until and unless you overcome these hindrances inside you - nothing will change- You need to clear your blocks of watery signs to change your reality as your belief system becomes your reality.
Once you clear your hindrances in the head -you start attracting wealth, happiness, peace as now your belief systems are changed.",Data Cleansing,English; Video

As more private colleges start to succumb to financial pressures, you'll want to be able to compare one against the other, in terms of their financial health and viability. This short video highlights just 12 numbers in a private college's financial statement that any viewer/reader can use to make their own assessment of the comparative financial health of one or more colleges you may be considering.

Here is the Federal Audit Clearninghouse link: https://facdissem.census.gov/            Instructions are included in the video on how to find a college's financial statement. 

While private college financial statements are hard to find and difficult to understand and compare, the College Viability App makes comparisons easy - even if you are not a finance or higher education professional. 

College closures in the coming months and years may not be common, but college finances - along with enrollment and graduation rates - are an increasingly important part of making the best, most informed college decision possible. The College Viability App makes those comparisons easier. 

There are no predictions - just side by side college comparisons for you to use in making your college decisions

What Exactly is Machine Learning?
A good start at a Machine Learning definition is that it is a core sub-area of Artificial Intelligence (AI). ML applications learn from experience (well data) like humans without direct programming. When exposed to new data, these applications learn, grow, change, and develop by themselves. 

What is Supervised Learning?
In supervised learning, we use known or labeled data for the training data. Since the data is known, the learning is, therefore, supervised, i.e., directed into successful execution. The input data goes through the Machine Learning algorithm and is used to train the model. 

What is Unsupervised Learning?
In unsupervised learning, the training data is unknown and unlabeled - meaning that no one has looked at the data before. Without the aspect of known data, the input cannot be guided to the algorithm, which is where the unsupervised term originates from. This data is fed to the Machine Learning algorithm and is used to train the model. The trained model tries to search for a pattern and give the desired response. In this case, it is often like the algorithm is trying to break code like the Enigma machine but without the human mind directly involved but rather a machine.

What is Reinforcement Learning?
Like traditional types of data analysis, here, the algorithm discovers data through a process of trial and error and then decides what action results in higher rewards. Three major components make up reinforcement learning: the agent, the environment, and the actions. The agent is the learner or decision-maker, the environment includes everything that the agent interacts with, and the actions are what the agent does.

In this video, Internet Marketer Amy will cover:
Introduction to A/B testing // 00:00:00
What is A/B testing? // 00:00:20
Why use A/B testing? // 00:01:16
What elements you can A/B test // 00:02:25
How to conduct an A/B test // 00:04:09
How long you should run an A/B test // 00:06:25
3 tips for A/B testing // 00:06:56

What is A/B testing, you ask? 

A/B testing basically means you make a variation of your content and test it against your original content. You can test everything from web design, to videos, to emails. 

So if you wanted to see how you can improve a contact form on your website, you would make a new form and compare its performance against the old form. The ""winner"" of the A/B test would be the form that has the better conversion rate, meaning more people filled it out. 

A/B testing goes along with conversion rate optimization, which is a marketing tactic that aims to increase the rate at which people take action on your content. 

A conversion doesn't necessarily have to be a purchase, but it can be. Examples of other conversions include downloading something from your website or signing up for your emails. 

Amy has some A/B testing examples to inspire you with your own testing. 

How do you run an A/B test? 

Use the scientific method. We'll explain how each step relates to your tests. Don't worry. We had to Google the steps, too. 

You'll need to use some A/B testing software to run your tests. This software includes Google Optimize, Optimizely, and Visual Website Optimizer. You can also analyze how people use your website with tools like Crazy Egg, Hotjar, and Userlytics. 

What are some tips for A/B testing?

1. Test only one element at a time
2. Don't just test things that are broken. Try to make something that works even better.
3. Don't be afraid to take risks.

What is Microsoft Excel?
Excel is one of the best applications available on the market for creating spreadsheets to crunch numbers and dashboard reports as well as storing and administering data. This software first appeared on the scene back in 1987, and since then it has grown to become one of the most popular pieces of software for home or business. Excel can be used for data entry to store data in the form of a table such as recording your daily expenses or business expenditure. It can also be used for inventory management.

What Is Microsoft Excel?
Excel is one of the best applications available on the market for creating spreadsheets to crunch numbers and dashboard reports as well as storing and administering data. This software first appeared on the scene back in 1987, and since then it has grown to become one of the most popular pieces of software for home or business.

What Is Excel Dashboard?
An excel dashboard is a visual interface that provides an overview of key measures relevant to a particular objective with the help of charts and graphs. Dashboard reports allow managers to gain a high-level overview of the business and help them make quick decisions. There are different types of dashboards such as strategic dashboards, analytical dashboards, and operational dashboards.

 If v is an eigenvector for eigenvalue Œª of a graph X and Œ± is an automorphism of X, then Œ±(v) is also an eigenvector for Œª. Thus it is rather exceptional for an eigenvalue of a vertex-transitive graph to be simple.

JavaScript is a popular programming language which is used for web development and change the behavior of the pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities. JavaScript is mostly used for Client side development however you can also perform server side development as well.

This is a new training for Learning JavaScript with ServiceNow.
In this training you will learn JavaScript Programming language and how you run a javascript code in ServiceNow. This training targets ServiceNow Developers who wants to perform development and scripting in ServiceNow to achieve complex requirements of customers and clients. Non ServiceNow professionals can also watch the training to learn JavaScript.

This training has been developed considering no prior knowledge of JavaScript. If you will not work on ServiceNow development, you can still watch this training for learning JavaScript. The only difference from other JavaScript training is that all practical examples of javascript code will be shown in Servicenow application and in some cases they will be related to ServiceNow functionalities as well.

By the end of this training You will have a complete understanding of JavaScript language and programming. However Learning JavaScript is not the only thing needed for performing scripting or development in servicenow. ServiceNow provides different classes and methods which you can call with javascript to perform different action in servicenow.
In order to perform development in ServiceNow by using these methods, you need to complete servicenow development training as well as this series of training will be focusing majorly on javascript language.

What is Mean, Median and Mode?

Mean the the sum average of all data values and gives us the value which is most common in our data and around which the rest of our data values lie.
The median is the middle score for a set of data that has been arranged in order of magnitude. The median is less affected by outliers and skewed data and is more reliable than mean.
The mode is the most frequently occuring value in our data. On a histogram it represents the highest bar in a bar chart or histogram. You can, therefore, sometimes consider the mode as being the most popular option.

PtBr0fpKyFg,Git and GitHub Crash Course By Google Coursera | Git and GitHub Tutorial for Beginners,Nerd's lesson,https://youtube.com/watch?v=PtBr0fpKyFg,2021-03-10T21:40:52Z,"About this Course-------------------------------------------------- In this course, you'll learn how to keep track of the different versions of your code and configuration files ...",en-US,5987,227,3,9,14.0,"-----------------------------------------------------About this Course--------------------------------------------------
In this course, you‚Äôll learn how to keep track of the different versions of your code and configuration files using a popular version control system (VCS) called Git. We'll also go through how to setup an account with a service called GitHub so that you can create your very own remote repositories to store your code and configuration. 

Throughout this course, you'll learn about Git's core functionality so you can understand how and why it‚Äôs used in organizations. We‚Äôll look into both basic and more advanced features, like branches and merging. We'll demonstrate how having a working knowledge of a VCS like Git can be a lifesaver in emergency situations or when debugging. And then we'll explore how to use a VCS to work with others through remote repositories, like the ones provided by GitHub.

Ella learns-to-code with this app.  It has a very fun way to help kids learn how to code.  Ella even says it herself that she likes the game!  She does fun activities and puzzles by coding a cute character to achieve the objective. She tells the character to walk, jump, build, bomb, move, etc. This app teaches her logic when it comes to computers and how they work. This game is a little bit hard for her so if you plan on getting this game, make sure you will have some time to walk your kid(s) through the stages.  Helping Ella and showing her better ways to complete the stages helped her move farther along in the game.

Hope you enjoy learning and playing with Ella and her Mommy. Please like and subscribe if you want to see more.

Use MATLAB to develop predictive maintenance ...,en,1183,28,1,0,43.0,"Predict the health condition and time to failure of an industrial duct fan using MATLAB¬Æ  and ThingSpeak‚Ñ¢. Use MATLAB to develop predictive maintenance algorithms based on measured vibration data from an instrumented fan. Simulate a variety of failure conditions, including a blocked fan and a fan with dust buildup. Extract features from the vibration data and build and train a machine learning model to diagnose the different types of failure. With Predictive Maintenance Toolbox‚Ñ¢, create a model that estimates the time to failure of the fan. The data processing, feature extraction, and training of machine learning and predictive maintenance (condition-based maintenance) models are performed offline using MATLAB tools. The same code used for offline training and the trained model are uploaded to the cloud and used to predict the condition of the fan using the built-in MATLAB Analysis app on ThingSpeak.

On ThingSpeak, you can execute predictive algorithms on the data as the data streams in. The channel display shows the current condition of the fan and can be viewed from any Internet-connected web browser or mobile device. You can also configure ThingSpeak to send an SMS and email alert when the time to failure is predicted to be less than a certain threshold value. 

See how to quickly prototype condition-monitoring algorithms with ThingSpeak and MATLAB.

In this GitHub Actions Tutorial we go through the following topics:
First I explain what GitHub Actions actually is and we will look at specific developer workflow use cases that you can automate with GitHub Actions .
After that I explain the basic concepts of GitHub Actions, including the GitHub Events and Actions and workflow and HOW GitHub Actions actually automates these workflows using these components.
Having understood what GitHub Actions solves and how it makes it possible, I will go through the most common workflow, which is CI/CD pipeline.
I will explain shortly why it is not just another ci/cd tool or what are the benefits of GitHub Actions ci cd pipeline.
Finally we will go through a hands-on DEMO, where I explain the syntax of github actions workflow file, and then I show you a complete ci pipeline setup with my example Java Gradle project, which we will build into a Docker Image and push to a private Docker repository on DockerHub.

Watch Great Learning's 8-hour tutorial on Python! Python is a high-level programming language, with basic syntax, very much similar to the English Language. Python is an extremely popular programming language with huge amounts of people learning it every day. But it is just as essential to apply these learned concepts in a Python programming application to check whether or not what your learning is correct. 

Great Learning brings you this tutorial on Python to take you from the starting point through the finishing point of everything you need to know about this domain and getting started on the journey to master it. This video starts off by introducing you to Python and Python integrated development environments, followed by looking at Python data structures, flow control statements and functions. Then we look at the concept of object-oriented programming, learn numerical computing with Numpy and understand data manipulation with Pandas. Following this, we will learn data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries. Finally, we look at a couple of Python Projects to implement everything one would‚Äôve learned so far. This video teaches Python and its key functions and concepts with a variety of demonstrations and examples to help you get started on the right foot.

RLfTxtgeVhM,Spark Streaming Example with PySpark ‚ùå BEST Apache SPARK Structured STREAMING TUTORIAL with PySpark,DecisionForest,https://youtube.com/watch?v=RLfTxtgeVhM,2020-10-15T12:00:09Z,In this video we'll understand Spark Streaming with PySpark through an applied example of how we might use Structured Streaming in a real world scenario.,en,11260,251,11,31,22.0,"In this video we'll understand Spark Streaming with PySpark through an applied example of how we might use Structured Streaming in a real world scenario.

Stream processing is the act of continuously incorporating new data to compute a result. In stream processing, the input data has no predetermined beginning or end as it simply forms a series of events that arrive as a stream (ex. credit card transactions).

Here we're focusing on Structured Streaming in Spark using Python, more specifically PySpark, and in the simplest terms, Structured Streaming is a dataFrame, but streaming.

The main idea behind Spark Structured Streaming is to treat a stream of data as a table, a dataset to which data is continuously appended. The job then periodically checks for new input data, processes it and updates the result.

RNDrhllXQAo,Database Systems - What is SQL - Structured Query Language,Appficial,https://youtube.com/watch?v=RNDrhllXQAo,2021-09-02T16:58:24Z,"A query is a command to insert, retrieve, update, or delete data from a database. A query language, such as SQL, is a programming language for creating ...",en,28,4,0,0,32.0,"A query is a command to insert, retrieve, update, or delete data from a database.  A query language, such as SQL, is a programming language for creating queries. SQL (pronounced sequel) stands for Structured Query Language, and was developed by IBM in the 70s, and is currently the most popular query language for all relational databases.

A SQL¬†statement¬†is a database command that can:
INSERT¬†inserts rows into a table.
SELECT¬†retrieves data from a table.
UPDATE¬†modifies data in a table.
DELETE¬†deletes rows from a table.

The SQL language can also create or delete a database or table, assigning user permissions, and more.

The¬†CREATE TABLE¬†statement in SQL creates a new table by specifying the table and column names with assigned¬†data types¬†that indicates the format of column values. Data types can be:

INT - stores integer values.
DECIMAL - stores fractional numeric values.
VARCHAR - stores text values.
DATE - stores year, month and day.

Some data types are followed by the size of the data in parenthesis, Ex: VARCHAR(15) indicates fifteen characters. DECIMAL(5, 2) indicates five significant digits, including two after the decimal point.

Most programs that use a database have SQL statements combined with a programming language such as Python, Java or C++. To make things easier, an API (application programming interface) is provided to help connect the programming language to a database. The language in your program calls library procedures, which handle details such as connecting to the database, executing queries, or returning results. For example, Java uses the JDBC library to access relational databases. There are database APIs available for each programming language.

‚Ä¢ Perform gradual feature rollouts
‚Ä¢ Fix bugs in the code without redeploying
‚Ä¢ Experience a more streamlined development cycle
‚Ä¢ Rollback code easily

We aim to get designers comfortable experimenting with feature flags.  This talk will not be overly technical.  You'll understand the basics and how they apply to your work as a product designer.

VIDEO DESCRIPTION: 
Dashboard design is a major part of Tableau. It is basically taking raw data in the form of Tables and converting them into a collection of visualizations that tell a story. 

There are several types of visualizations you can build; some that make a very specific statement, deep dive and exploration tools, story telling collection of visualizations and more. 

In this video I'll show you exactly how I go about visualizing data in my day to day life. I'll also mention how design meets working with clients. 

The visualizations you'll be learning here are maps, split maps, map settings, colour schemes, layout design, design considerations, histograms, bins, scatter plots, pie charts, line charts and more. 

Lastly, you'll learn my quick design method which lets me build an entire dashboard in seconds!!

With the Deep learning making the breakthrough in all the fields of science and technology, Deep Learning Computer Vision is the field which is picking up at the faster rate where we see the applications in most of the applications out there.

Be it, Facebook's image tagging feature, Google Photo's People Recognition along with Scenery detection, Fraud detection, Facial Recognition, We are seeing the Deep Learning Computer Vision Applications out there. 

A typical task in Deep Learning Computer vision task will include the methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of these high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, with which we can form decisions.

A typical & basic operation we perform is - Convolution Operations on Images, where we try to learn the representations of the image so that the computer can learn the most of the data from the input images.

In this course,

We will be learning one of the widely used Deep Learning Framework, i.e PyTorch

It is said as,

PyTorch to be Goto Tool for DeepLearning for Product Prototypes as well as Academia.

We are going to prefer learning - PyTorch for these Reasons:

It is Pythonic

Easy to Learn

Higher Developer Productivity

Dynamic Approach for Graph computation - AutoGrad

GPU Support for computation, and much more...

In this course,  We are going to implement Step by Step approach of learning:

Understand Basics of PyTorch

Learn to Code in GPU & with guide to access free GPU for learning

Learn Auto Grad feature of PyTorch

Implement Deep Learning models in Pytorch

Learn the Basics of Convolutional Neural Networks in PyTorch(CNN)

Practical Application of CNN's on Real World Dataset

We believe that,

Learning will not be complete, untill you as a student has the confidence on the Subject.

So,

We have added Assignments at the end of each Section so that you can measure your progress along with learning.

We look forward to see you inside the course.

All the best.

""Time series analysis plays a crucial rule in the telecom applications, such as network quality analysis, network capacity forecast, smart power management, etc. There‚Äôs a recent trend to apply machine learning methods (especially neural networks) to such problems, and they are reported to perform better in many cases than traditional methods such as autoregression and exponential smoothing.

However, building the machine learning applications for time series forecasting can be a laborious and knowledge-intensive process. In this talk, we present Project Zouwu, which provides Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) to time series analysis for Telco application. It is built on top of Ray (https://github.com/ray-project/ray) and Analytics Zoo (https://github.com/intel-analytics/analytics-zoo), so as to automate the process of feature generation and selection, model selection and hyper-parameter tuning in a distributed fashion.

NoSQL Databases For Beginners - learn NoSQL
What you will learn in this course ?
What you'll learnDefine viewsReduce data via reduce functionDeploy applicationsSecure NoSQL DatabaseStore data in NoSQL DatabaseRetrieve data in NoSQL DatabaseQuery NoSQL database without using SQLBuild a web application
NoSQL (Non-SQL or Not-only-SQL) databases are increasing in popularity due to the growth of data as they can store non-relational data on a super large scale, and can solve problems regular databases can't handle. They are widely used in Big data operations. Their main advantage is the ability to handle large data sets¬† effectively¬† as well as scalability and flexibility issues for modern applications. There are different categories of NoSQL¬† databases and they are used in social media such as with Facebook¬† and search like Google and in other types of sectors like Health, Aviation,Education¬† and other areas.

This course will teach you technical hands-on knowledge of NoSQL¬† databases. We will Use the CouchDB NoSQL database as an example to learn how to create and replicate databases, load and query data, and other operations.
In this course you will learn how to to build an entire web application with CouchDB and learn techniques such as querying with JavaScript, working with nested data, and creating views.
You will learn how to query a database without¬† SQL by using JavaScript Map and Reduce functions and also using HTTP to retrieve raw JSON data .
Using the couchDB database you will learn how to insert data into the database using Key -Value pairs where every data key will have a corresponding value. 
Security and integrity of a database is very important¬† . This course will also teach you how to apply security to the couchDB database to prevent unauthorised access.
Topics include:
¬†¬† ‚Ä¢What is NoSQL?
¬†¬† ‚Ä¢Categories of NoSQL databases
¬†¬† ‚Ä¢Installing CouchDB 
¬†¬† ‚Ä¢Storing data
¬†¬† ‚Ä¢Nesting document data
¬†¬† ‚Ä¢Specifying search criteria
¬†¬† ‚Ä¢Reducing data via reduce function
¬†¬† ‚Ä¢Attaching and retrieving images
¬†¬† ‚Ä¢Deploying applications
¬†¬† ‚Ä¢Securing CouchDB
¬†¬† ‚Ä¢Introduction to other NoSQL databases

Vector autoregression (VAR) is a statistical model used to capture the relationship between multiple quantities as they change over time

VAR models (vector autoregressive models) are used for multivariate time series. The structure is that each variable is a linear function of past lags of itself and past lags of the other variables

The Granger causality test is a statistical hypothesis test for determining whether one time series is useful in forecasting another

The Augmented Dickey Fuller Test (ADF) is unit root test for stationarity. Unit roots can cause unpredictable results in your time series analysis.",Time Series Analysis,Autoregressive (AR) Model; Forecasting; Granger Causality; Statistical Hypothesis Testing; Statistical Model; Time Series Analysis; Variable; Vector Autoregression (VAR); Video; Youtube

Graph Applications - Introduction to Graph Theory
Introduction to Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science Specialization
We invite you to a fascinating journey into Graph Theory ‚Äî an area which connects the elegance of painting and the rigor of mathematics;  is simple, but not unsophisticated. Graph Theory gives us, both an easy way to pictorially represent many major mathematical results, and insights into the deep theories behind them. 

In this course, among other intriguing applications, we will see how GPS systems find shortest routes, how engineers design integrated circuits, how biologists assemble genomes, why a political map can always be colored using a few colors. We will study Ramsey Theory which proves that in a large system, complete disorder is impossible! 

By the end of the course, we will implement an algorithm which finds an optimal assignment of students to schools. This algorithm, developed by David Gale and Lloyd S. Shapley, was later recognized by the conferral of Nobel Prize in Economics.

As prerequisites we assume only basic math (e.g., we expect you to know what is a square or how to add fractions), basic programming in python (functions, loops, recursion), common sense and curiosity. Our intended audience are all people that work or plan to work in IT, starting from motivated high school students.

I wish to thank the professors for having brought this course to Coursera, this topic is absolutely fantastic, and very well presented. I highly recommend it.,It was really good experiencing the different way of learning everything explained so properly all doubt are clear and the quiz and puzzle really helpfull
What are graphs? What do we need them for? This week we'll see that a graph is a simple pictorial way to represent almost any relations between objects. We'll see that we use graph applications daily! We'll learn what graphs are, when and how to use them, how to draw graphs, and we'll also see the most important graph classes. We start off with two interactive puzzles. While they may be hard, they demonstrate the power of graph theory very well! If you don't find these puzzles easy, please see the videos and reading materials after them.

In general, we contribute to open-source projects following the fork-and-pull"" Git workflow
Install Git on your OS
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
1. Fork the repository to your own Github account
2. Clone the project to your machine
```
git clone https://github.com/""your-github-username""/Mumble.git
```
3. Add Upstream or the remote of the original project to your local repository
```
# check remotes
git remote -v
git remote add upstream https://github.com/divanov11/Mumble.git
```
4. Make sure you update the local repository
```
# Get updates
git fetch upstream
# switch to master branch
git checkout master
# Merge updates to local repository
git merge upstream/master
# Push to github repository
git push origin master
```
5. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name
```
git checkout -b branch-name
```
6. Commit changes to the branch
```
# Stage changes for commit i.e add all modified files to commit
git add .
git commit -m ""added git commands for ""fork-and-pull"" Git workflow""
# check status
git status
```
7. Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repository
8. Push changes to your fork
```
git push origin branch-name
```
9. Open a PR in our repository and follow the PR template so that we can efficiently review the changes.
10. After the pull request was merged, fetch it and update the default branch of your fork


#### NB
1. You have to install Git for your operating system
https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
2. Never Commit on the default branch, commit on branches then make a pull request
3. After making changes, if you want to make another change make sure you branch from the default branch because if you branch from branch-name, this will contain the changes from the 1st pull request except for the new pull request you working on requires the changes from the first pull request
```
# check present branch
git branch
# switch to master branch   
git checkout master
# create new branch for new changes
git checkout -b 2nd-test-branch
# make new changes and push to your fork
```
4. After the pull request was merged, fetch the upstream and update the default branch of your fork

üîµ  Why MongoDB is important?

MongoDB stores data in a JSON document format. This allows you to throw whatever data you want from it without worrying about the relations of the data. The fact that it is a JSON store also means that information can be retrieved very quickly. Things that would take minutes for relational databases to find can be found in MongoDB in mere seconds. Basically, in any situation where the data isn‚Äôt relational and needs to be processed quickly, MongoDB is the database you should be choosing. This is why in most big data workplaces, you will find MongoDB (or a similar database) being used instead of the databases we are used to.

üîµ  Why should you opt for a MongoDB career?

If you want to fast-track your career then you should strongly consider MongoDB. The reason for this is that it is one of the fastest-growing technology. There is a huge demand for MongoDB. The salaries for MongoDB are fantastic. There is a huge growth opportunity in this domain as well.

Hopefully, it'll give you some ideas for building your own risk management dashboard using Power BI.

The dashboard has 3 main pages
Page 1 - An executive overview page with an overall risk status, a risk matrix and dynamic text explaining the current situation.

Page 2 - A page providing an overview of the pre-mitigation and post-mitigation risk. This page provides an analysis of the percentage and number of risks in different risk grouping (high, medium, and low) that have been mitigated.

Page 3 - A risk trend analysis. This page provides an overview of risk over time. It demonstrates if the risk is increasing or decreasing. The trends displayed are for each risk group, high, medium and low as well as an overview of all risk. There is also a dynamically created analysis of each risk group and a comparison against a target level of risk in each group.

Everyone uses it, but very few understand the consequences and implications of this phrase.

Also, your data, whether structured poorly or diligently, forms the foundation of your business model.

But why? 

Because many data sets are relevant in the ERP conversations, such as master, configuration, transactional, and historical, they each have their implications on the selection and implementation of ERP.

Suppose you implement or select an ERP without going through the phase of data cleansing or aligning your data with the future business model. In that case, you might end up choosing an incorrect ERP, as your poorly structured data may be influencing the decision for your ERP.

The data cleansing could mean aligning your BOMs with your production process or your customer structure with how you transact with them. 

But how to follow the structured data cleaning approach to select the suitable ERP and avoid implementation disaster?

Let's hear from experts Andy Pratico, Marcia Williams, Jill Robbins, Stephanie Shrader, Christiano Gherardini, and Sam Gupta as they share their expertise on the advantages of data cleansing prior to implementation.

What is Artificial Intelligence (in 5 minutes).  Machine Learning Crash Course

In this video I try to answer the question, ‚ÄúWhat is artificial intelligence?‚Äù in less than 5 minutes.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the term used to describe the development of software and computers (machines) to the point at which they begin to learn and develop and to solve problems on their own initiative in the same way that the human mind can do.

AI is defined as the use of so called ‚Äòintelligent agents‚Äô which make decisions that maximise their chances of success or reaching their goals. 

IBM defines AI like this: ""Artificial intelligence enables computers and machines to mimic the perception, learning, problem-solving, and decision-making capabilities of the human mind.""

An early example might be the AI algorithms that made computer chess a reality.  The AI would learn what moves to make in order to reach the goal of checkmate while at the same time defending itself against being held in check.

More  recent examples include autonomous vehicles with the goal of reaching a destination while preventing accidents and avoiding hazards, or AI within content delivery networks that make decisions about the routing of data when there are multiple paths available and in which the optimal paths shift with the dynamic nature of the network.

It could be said that the decades from the 1950s to the 2010s were sixty years of development of AI and now we have entered the next phase of massive rollout and implementation of AI with all the advantages and disadvantages that this will bring us.

AI is actually an umbrella term for two other processes namely machine learning and deep learning.   

Machine Learning is when computers reprogram themselves as they digest more and more data in order to optimise their ability to reach their established goals.

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning in which machines learn how to perform specific tasks more efficiently and accurately.

About Us:
Traditionally, children are educated only within the confines of the school ‚Äúsyllabus‚Äù. As a result, their imagination is contained rather than given a free reign. Hatch School of Code hopes to change that one child at a time. We believe free thinking is the foundation upon which creativity and innovation flourishes. We want to help build the next generation of creators and innovators by supplying them with the required skills to make their imaginations come to life.
 
There is no such thing as starting too early. The youngest app developer is currently a 9 year old girl who has created THREE apps!

K-Means for Cluster Analysis and Unsupervised Learning - learn Cluster Analysis

What you will learn in this course ?

What you'll learnThe basic fundamentals of Unsupervised Learning: Cluster Analysis and Pattern RecognitionHow the K-Means algorithm works in general. Get an intuitive explanation with graphics that are easy to understandHow the K-Means algorithm is defined mathematically and how it is derived.Implementing the K-Means algorithm in Python from scratch. Get a really profound understanding of the working principleHow to implement K-Means very fast with one line of code

Learn why and where K-Means is a powerful toolClustering is a very important part of machine learning. Especially unsupervised machine learning is a rising topic in the whole field of artificial intelligence. If we want to learn about cluster analysis, there is no better method to start with, than the k-means algorithm.

Get a good intuition of the algorithmThe K-Means algorithm is explained in detail. We will first cover the principle mechanics without any mathematical formulas, just by visually observing data points and clustering behavior. After that, the mathematical background of the method is explained in detail.

Learn how to implement the algorithm in PythonFirst we will learn how to implement K-Means from scratch. That means for the beginning no additional packages will be used, except numpy. This is important to get a really good grip on the functioning of the algorithm.You will of course also learn how to implement the algorithm really quickly by using only one line of code.The examples will be based on artificial data, which we generate ourselves in the course.

Learn where you should pay attentionK-Means is a powerful tool but it definetely has drawbacks! You will learn where you have to be careful and when you should use the algorithm, and also when it is a bad idea to use the algorithm. I will show you examples and counterexamples on the quality and applicability of this method.

As WebAuthn and the FIDO2 framework continue to mature, many developers continue to struggle with understanding the terms and functionality continuously being added to the various specifications. Sometimes, just keeping up requires a good deal of knowledge about identity, authentication, and security. While having a security engineering team shouldn't be a prerequisite for adopting FIDO2, it sure can help! This talk will address some of the obstacles that engineers may face when implementing WebAuthn and FIDO2. Additionally, we'll draw from our experiences with real-world deployments and developing widely used WebAuthn libraries to explain the terms and concepts that are central to FIDO2, and what it takes to ensure a successful deployment. Finally, we'll discuss account recovery options, authenticator attestation and when to do it, and some of the recent additions to WebAuthn attestation statement formats.",Presentation,Authentication; Presentation; Security Engineering

Why machine learning is important?

Machine learning might just be one of the most important fields of science that we are just moving towards. It differs from other science in the sense that this is one of the one domains where the input and output are not directly correlated and neither do we provide the input for every task that the machine will perform. It is more about mimicking how humans think and solving real world problems like humans without actually the intervention of humans. It focuses on developing computer programs that can be taught to grown and change when exposed to data.

Thankfully, effective data visualization is not only a skill for artists and designers, anyone can improve their data presentation by choosing the right visuals and following best practices.     In this session, we will discuss how different types of visuals are perceived and which charts are best suited to each category. We‚Äôll cover a basic introduction into colour theory, how to use colour effectively in reports, and how to create Power BI themes for your enterprise. Finally, you will learn an introduction to the design approach and how it helps us to tell a good data story.

This workshop will be an example of how you can confidently learn fundamental statistics and coding skills needed to understand and practice Data Science. In particular, you will learn the following important concepts:

Statistics: A/B testing, hypothesis testing, p-value, permutations, and permutation test.
Coding: variables, loops, and functions.

We start by discussing ‚ÄúWhat is an A/B test?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhy do we use A/B testing?‚Äù, followed by several examples of A/B tests in Data Science. Then, we answer the main question of ‚ÄúHow is an A/B test done?‚Äù with a detailed explanation of the steps involved in the A/B testing process (using didactic animations to illustrate those steps).

Afterward, we introduce permutations and the Permutation Test as a good method to do the hypothesis testing part of an A/B test. We explain the Permutation Test process in detail, using didactic animations to illustrate the steps involved.

Throughout this process, we provide intuitive explanations for hypothesis testing and the associated statistical concepts. In particular, we provide a clear graphical/visual interpretation of what is the p-value.

Finally, we show how to code the learned concepts (from scratch) using both Python and R.

This is an introductory-level webinar perfect for anyone interested in learning Data Science. You don‚Äôt need prior experience or background in coding nor statistics.

Supervised learning is a form of machine learning where an algorithm learns from examples of data. We progressively paint a picture of how supervised learning automatically generates a model that can make predictions about the real world. We also touch on how these models are tested, and difficulties that can arise when training them. In this episode, you will:

Define supervised and unsupervised learning.
Explore how cost functions affect the learning process.
Discover how models are optimized by gradient descent.
Experiment with learning rates, and see how they can affect training.

Apache Beam | A Hands-On course to build Big data Pipelines - learn Big Data
What you will learn in this course ?
What you'll learnLearn Apache Beam with its Real-Time implementation.Build Real-Time business's Big data processing pipelines using Apache Beam.Learn a portable programming model whose pipelines can be deployed on Spark, Flink, GCP (Google Cloud Dataflow) etc.Understand the working of each and every component of Apache Beam with HANDS-ON Practicals.Develop pipelines for Real world Big data case studies in various business domains.Data-sets and Beam codes used in lectures are available in resources tab. This will save your typing efforts.Course will be updated upon each new Beam version update.
Apache Beam is a unified and portable programming model for both Batch and Streaming use cases.Earlier we could run Spark, Flink & Cloud Dataflow Jobs only on their respective clusters. But now Apache Beam has come up with a portable programming model where we can build language agnostic Big data pipelines and run it using any Big data engine (Apache Spark, Flink or in Google Cloud Platform using its Cloud Dataflow and many more Big data engines).Apache Beam is the future of building Big data processing pipelines and is going to be accepted by mass companies due to its portability. Many big companies have even started deploying Beam pipelines in their production servers.What's included in the course ?Complete Apache Beam concepts explained¬†from Scratch to Real-Time implementation.Each and every Apache Beam concept is explained with a HANDS-ON example of it.Include even those concepts, the explanation to which is not very clear even in Apache Beam's official documentation.Build 2 Real-time Big data case studies using Beam.Codes and Datasets¬†used in lectures are¬†attached in the course for your convenience.

In this video, I assume that you are completely new to programming. We'll walk through how to get Python, how to run your first code, and how to get an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to help you code faster. You'll also learn about variables and how to set them. We'll look at functions, if statements, while and for loops, and we'll import libraries. At the end, we'll also look at how you can troubleshoot your code, for instance, when you run into syntax, semantic, or runtime errors. By the end, you'll know how to run code and you'll also understand the basic concepts of programming. My name is Kevin Stratvert and I'll be your guide to Python.

Which one is better? When should you use each one? Which should you use to manage your data? What's the final verdict?

Marc from Akron OH (a Gold Member) asks: I just started a small business and I can't decide whether I want to use Excel or Access to manage my customers, contact, orders, inventory, and so on. I don't want to use off-the-shelf accounting software like QuickBooks because I do have some unique record-keeping needs for my business. I've been using Excel for years, but I hear Access is a lot more powerful. What do you recommend?

BONUS FOR CHANNEL MEMBERS:
Silver Members and up get access to an EXTENDED CUT of this video which covers additional examples. That video will show you how to import and link data from Excel into Access. This way your secretary can perform data entry in Excel and you can bring it into Access. I'll show you how to use an append query to automate the process of importing newly entered data in an Excel sheet. Then we'll go the other way. I'll show you how to link Excel to an Access table so your secretary can see your customer list, itinerary, or whatever else you have in your Access database. I'll show you a trick to refresh that link every time he opens the sheet.

It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB. MongoDB is a schema-less NoSQL document database - definition from freecodecamp.org
So, there is no need to write or learn complex database queries or create complicated schemas. 
Now, as you may have seen above that there are many advantages of using any ORM over writing Raw DB queries. Check out the video to know more.

Model-based vs model-free - Practical Reinforcement Learning
Advanced Machine Learning Specialization
Welcome to the Reinforcement Learning course. 

Here you will find out about:

- foundations of RL methods: value/policy iteration, q-learning, policy gradient, etc.
--- with math & batteries included

- using deep neural networks for RL tasks
--- also known as the hype train

- state of the art RL algorithms
--- and how to apply duct tape to them for practical problems.

- and, of course, teaching your neural network to play games
--- because that's what everyone thinks RL is about. We'll also use it for seq2seq and contextual bandits.

Jump in. It's gonna be fun!

Do you have technical problems? Write to us: coursera@hse.ru

A great course with very practical assignments to help you learn how to implement RL algorithms. But it also has some stupid quiz questions which makes you feel confusing.,Challenging (unlike many other courses on Coursera, it does not baby you and does not seem to be targeting as high a pass rate as possible), but very very rewarding.

But now, Google's Deepmind has created a Meta-Learning AI which keeps on learning and improving indefinitely without any Human supervision. Deepmind created the AI Game: Alchemy, which is a chemistry-based game for AI Agents to play and improve in. But Artificial Intelligence improving without limits also puts some concerns into AI researchers focused on deep learning.

There has been rapidly growing interest in meta-learning as a method for increasing the flexibility and sample efficiency of reinforcement learning.

Programming is very simple if you know the basic of how a program works internally.

Java in simple words: 
Java is invented by James Gosling

Object: Anything which has state and behavior is called an object
Class: Class is a blueprint to create objects
Data types: Data types are used to defined properties type
Functions: Functions/Methods are used to defined behavior of the object and are called by an object using dot(.) operator.

Instead of showing the typical mathematical derivation of the proof, I explain the resulting formula by walking through an example of playing a game and figuring out how we can estimate the policy gradient of the expected return by sampling episodes from the environment. I also show some graph visualizations that give an intuition for how the partial derivatives with respect to the action probabilities are backpropagated to get the correct policy gradient within the limited action space (where all probabilities have to sum to 1). I also explain how we can use the log probabilities instead of the direct probabilities (the log-derivative trick) for improved computational efficiency. I also walk through some pseudocode (Python / PyTorch inspired) of the derived policy gradient algorithm, which is a variant of the REINFORCE algorithm. And I show how we can reduce the variance by normalizing the future returns and dividing by the number of steps instead of the number of episodes.

Policy gradient methods are used in many of the current state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms, and I think it is likely that policy gradient methods will play be an important role in advancing the field of RL. I'm excited to continue exploring this field and sharing what I learn along the way.

What is Artificial Intelligence?
Artificial Intelligence or AI is the combination of algorithms used for the purpose of creating intelligent machines that have the same skills as a human being. It uses machine learning and deep learning techniques to build complex systems. AI has made significant advances in the past few years and has impacted both our everyday lives and business in big ways. It is being widely used in every sector of business, such as Healthcare, E-Commerce, Manufacturing, Retail, and Logistics.

You will master TensorFlow, Machine Learning and other AI concepts, plus the programming languages needed to design intelligent agents, deep learning algorithms & advanced artificial neural networks that use predictive analytics to solve real-time decision-making problems without explicit programming.

Why learn Artificial Intelligence? 
The current and future demand for AI engineers is staggering. The New York Times reports a candidate shortage for certified AI Engineers, with fewer than 10,000 qualified people in the world to fill these jobs, which according to Paysa earn an average salary of $172,000 per year in the U.S. (or Rs.17 lakhs to Rs. 25 lakhs in India) for engineers with the required skills.

You can gain in-depth knowledge of Artificial Intelligence by taking our Artificial Intelligence certification training course. Those who complete the course will be able to: 
1. Master the concepts of supervised and unsupervised learning
2. Gain practical mastery over principles, algorithms, and applications of machine learning through a hands-on approach which includes working on 28 projects and one capstone project.
3. Acquire thorough knowledge of the mathematical and heuristic aspects of machine learning.
4. Understand the concepts and operation of support vector machines, kernel SVM, aive bayes, decision tree classifier, random forest classifier, logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors, K-means clustering and more.
5. Comprehend the theoretical concepts and how they relate to the practical aspects of machine learning.
6. Be able to model a wide variety of robust machine learning algorithms including deep learning, clustering, and recommendation systems

You have probably wondered what is the most practical way of getting your feet wet in Hadoop and Data Science (even if you are not interested in this, you should seriously consider so since in the next 10-15 years, Data Science and Artificial Intelligence will be everywhere).,I have learned over 14 programming languages such as JAVA, Python, C++, R, Matlab, Ruby, CSS, HTML, Angular JS, Java Script as well as other . I have also had a successful freelancing career programming software and mobile applications and well as working as a finance data analyst. Since technology is changing every day, it is adding new realms of complexity to Big Data and Data science than is already out there. It is getting exponentially harder for new people to learn and navigate the immense amount of data science aspects. My job in this course is to demyistify Big Data so you can see a clear road to success as a Hadoop Developer.,This course serves to help you navigate Hadoop and know what this seemingly difficult concept really is. In this course, I cover what it is like to be a data analyst, what are some jobs of data analysts, what are the sorts of super powers you can possess by learning Hadoop, and also what resources you will need on your path to development as a Big Data. My hope is to transform you in 4-5 lectures from being a novice to data and what is possible with Hadoop to being someone who has a clear idea of whether he/she is interested in Hadoop and what path they can take to further their knowledge and harness the POWER of Hadooop.,There is no risk for you as a student in this course. I have put together a course that is not only worth your money, but also worth your time. This course encompasses the basics of Hadoop I urge you to join me on this journey to learn how you can start learning how to dominate data analytics and how you can supercharge your business, marketing, or client with your superb analytics skills.,This course is meant for students willing to next generation Information TechnologyAnybody who wants an entry to the realm of Big DataNo prior Big Data experience is needed,This course is meant for students willing to next generation Information Technology,Anybody who wants an entry to the realm of Big Data,No prior Big Data experience is needed",Hadoop,Angular; Apache Hadoop; Artificial Intelligence (AI); Big Data; C++; Cascading Style Sheet (CSS); Complexity; Data Analysis; Data Analytics; Data Science; Database Design; Finance; HyperText Markup Language (HTML); Information Technology (IT); Java; MATLAB; Marketing; Programming Language; Python; R; Rally; Ruby; Sentry; Sports; Transformer

As QA tester, I remember when I first started to learn Java. I used to look at other software Testers who were both manual testers as well as having the ability to code in Java with Intelli. I thought I want to be able to code also, so guess what I started to learn and study books on how to code as a beginner. I always liked Java as that's the first language I came across so diving into videos about Java Programming for beginners was quite interesting for me.

I learnt something valuable and that was that patience plays a key part in one's journey to become a java expert. i often asked what is the quickest way to learn Java? well to be honest, one must start from the java basics and continue to build on top of his or her knowledge. In short, your pace could be different another person's pace but believe me, you will reach your goal.

Quickest way to learn to Learn Java is to start coding in Java.
How to learn Java In 13 minutes will give you a great foundation into the world of IntelliJ and java programming.

In this video, I review my favorite graph theory book of all time: Introduction to Graph Theory by Richard J. Trudeau. Indeed, this book might even be my favorite mathematics book of all time.

The real beauty of this book is how approachable it is. The book aspires to not only teach graph theory but also show readers what pure mathematics is all about. But as Trudeau writes in the preface, the primary audience for this book is the ""mathematically traumatized.""

Trudeau's gentle approach, full of wonder and excitement, offers a fun and approachable introduction to graph theory and pure mathematics for readers of all mathematical backgrounds ‚Äî even if you've had a bad experience with mathematics in the past.

Over the last year, we‚Äôve added several features in Spark core/SQL to add first class support for Feature Injection and Feature Reaping in Spark. Feature Injection is an important prerequisite to (offline) ML training where the base features are injected/aligned with new/experimental features, with the goal to improve model performance over time. From a query engine‚Äôs perspective, this can be thought of as a LEFT OUTER join between the base training table and the feature table which, if implemented naively, could get extremely expensive. As part of this work, we added native support for writing indexed/aligned tables in Spark, wherein IF the data in the base table and the injected feature can be aligned during writes, the join itself can be performed inexpensively.

Feature Reaping is a compute efficient and low latency solution for deleting historical data at sub-partition granularity (i.e., columns or selected map keys), and in order to do it efficiently at our scale, we added a new physical encoding in ORC (called FlatMap) that allowed us to selectively reap/delete specific map keys (features) without performing expensive decoding/encoding and decompression/compression. In this talk, we‚Äôll take a deep dive into Spark‚Äôs optimizer, evaluation engine, data layouts and commit protocols and share how we‚Äôve implemented these complementary techniques. To this end, we‚Äôll discuss several catalyst optimizations to automatically rewrite feature injection/reaping queries as a SQL joins/transforms, describe new ORC physical encodings for storing feature maps, and discuss details of how Spark writes/commits indexed feature tables.

To run a successful company most businesses look at saving costs, ensuring its quality standards, simplifying process, scalability, data security, and measures. Cloud computing addresses most of these issues. With Cloud Computing becoming a standard in data management, adapted by large as well as startup companies, the growth rate of the Cloud market has been phenomenal. With the increasing demand, there are obviously plenty of opportunities in the field available in database management, security, analysis, and development for cloud engineers. 

Cloud Computing
In simple terms, it is an on-demand resource of computing services like storage, robust software, and processing power over the internet. It is an efficient solution that eliminates the need for someone to actively manage it. The company can avail its benefits as per its size and requirement. A known example of this is Google Drive. 
Companies hire third-party cloud service providers for their cloud needs. The key vendors of this service are Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Salesforce. Cloud computing has three categories called Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS).

Cloud Computing Career
Cloud computing has not only become an essential part of several companies but it has also created a demand for professionals who can assist businesses to seamlessly transfer to the cloud and who are proficient in using diverse cloud services.
Here are some roles in Cloud computing that are very much in demand:
‚àô         Cloud Infrastructure Engineer
‚àô         Cloud Architect
‚àô         Cloud Developer
‚àô         Cloud Computer Systems and Network Administrator
‚àô         Cloud Software Engineer
‚àô         Cloud Security Manager
‚àô         Cloud Automation Engineer
There are even vendor-specific roles. AWS and Microsoft Azure leads the cloud computing space and offer certain certifications that prepare a professional for profiles such as AWS Certified Developer, AWS Certified Solutions Architect, AWS Certified DevOps Engineer, Azure Security Engineer, Certified Azure Administrator, and so on.

Today, we have data present everywhere around us in the form of text, bills, photos, videos etc. Hence, It's management has become really important. Today, we'll be discussing about Database Management system through an example of Broadband Database Management System.

SQL is the standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving the data in databases. We will be covering the basics of SQL through this example of Broadband Database Management System. A database usually contains one or more tables and we apply different functionalities on the records of this database. A DBMS is a system software for creating and managing these databases.

In this tutorial, we will be teaching about data manipulation, it's extraction and fetching. Through this example, we will teach you how to update, read, create, delete data in a database. We will use different techniques such as Joins and we will learn to use various other SQL functions as well. So, stay tuned and watch the video till the end.

Following pointers will be covered in this video:

Deep Learning is made used by voice assistants, recommendation systems, image recognition and image detection models and many more. It‚Äôs used by companies like Facebook, Google, Netflix, Twitter, etc. The biggest reason why deep learning is playing such a large role in these tech products and services is because it can deal with ‚Äúunstructured data‚Äù.

Unstructured data refers to most of the data we have today, images, text, videos, etc. It would be impossible to label each and every image that is on the internet today. That is where deep learning comes in. Deep learning is able to learn characteristics and patterns by looking at images, text, audio, etc. Although ordinary machine learning is capable of this as well, it‚Äôs not as accurate and efficient as deep learning algorithms. With the large amounts of unstructured data we have in the world today, we need deep learning models in order to make sense of them, hence why it‚Äôs so important.

There are some amazing deep learning courses, and in this video I highlight four different courses with are suitable for beginners as well as learners with background in python programming and machine learning knowledge.

Traditional model-based loco-motion controllers require simplifying assumptions and careful modelling; any small errors can result in unstable control. To address these challenges for bipedal locomotion, we present a model-free reinforcement learning framework for training robust locomotion policies in simulation, which can then be transferred to a real bipedal Cassie robot. To facilitate sim-to-real transfer, domain randomization is used to encourage the policies to learn behaviors that are robust across variations in system dynamics. The learned policies enable Cassie to perform a set of diverse and dynamic behaviors, while also being more robust than traditional controllers and prior learning-based methods that use residual control. We demonstrate this on versatile walking behaviors such as tracking a target walking velocity, walking height, and turning yaw.",Reinforcement,Modelling; Motion Control; Reinforcement Learning; Robot; Training; Velocity

In this webinar we will demonstrate example use cases for Data Integration and ETL processes using frends low-code integration platform, and showcase the modelling of some of the processes that you can relate to your own needs.

-

frends integration platform has excellent ready-made capabilities for ETL integration scenarios and can process data in almost any format, including JSON, XML, CSV, Flat File, Fixed Width, EDI, and more. The native frends low-code approach allows to programmatically map and apply the transformations or choose from other well known and standardized approaches such as XSLT or JSONMap.

The low-code approach in integration is designed to serve both business users and professional developers alike.

What is Deep Learning?
Deep learning can be considered as a subset of machine learning. It is a field that is based on learning and improving on its own by examining computer algorithms. While machine learning uses simpler concepts, deep learning works with artificial neural networks, which are designed to imitate how humans think and learn. Until recently, neural networks were limited by computing power and thus were limited in complexity. However, advancements in Big Data analytics have permitted larger, sophisticated neural networks, allowing computers to observe, learn, and react to complex situations faster than humans. Deep learning has aided image classification, language translation, speech recognition.

‚úÖWhat is C++ Programming? 
C++ is an enhanced and extended version of C programming language, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 as part of his Ph.D. project. Bjarne developed what he called ‚ÄòC with Classes‚Äô (later renamed C++) because he felt limited by the existing programming languages that were not ideal for large scale projects. He used C to build what he wanted because C was already a general-purpose language that was efficient and fast in its operations.

‚úÖC++ Career Prospects:
With just C++ programming expertise, you will have excellent job opportunities, salaries, and career prospects. However, for a career based on programming languages such as Java and Python (which are in more demand than C++) or for careers based on front-end, back-end, and full-stack development, you will go a lot further with C++ expertise. Furthermore, in development domains such as software testing, you are expected to know C++.

What is Power BI?
Power BI is a technology-driven business intelligence tool provided by Microsoft for analyzing and visualizing raw data to present actionable information. It combines business analytics, data visualization, and best practices that help an organization to make data-driven decisions. In February 2019, Gartner confirmed Microsoft as Leader in the ""2019 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Analytics and Business Intelligence Platform"" as a result of the capabilities of the Power BI platform. Power BI is a business analytics service provided by Microsoft that lets you visualize your data and share insights. It converts data from different sources to build interactive dashboards and Business Intelligence reports.

Power BI Architecture:
Power BI architecture is a service built on top of Azure. There are multiple data sources that Power BI can connect to. Power BI Desktop allows you to create reports and data visualizations on the dataset. Power BI gateway is connected to on-premise data sources to get continuous data for reporting and analytics. Power BI services refer to the cloud services that are used to publish Power BI reports and data visualizations. Using Power BI mobile apps, you can stay connected to their data from anywhere. Power BI apps are available for Windows, iOS, and Android platforms.

What is a Power BI Dashboard?
A single page visualization with multiple charts and graphs to tell a story is called a Power BI dashboard. This one-page visualization in a dashboard is also known as a Canvas. The Power BI dashboard is a feature only available in Power BI Service. Since a Power BI dashboard is limited to one page, it only contains the highlights of a story. You cannot create a dashboard on Power BI Desktop. In a dashboard, visualizations are generated from reports, and each report is based on one dataset. The visualizations present on the dashboard are called tiles, and report designers pin these tiles to the dashboard.

You will learn how a gravity turn works, the deorbit descent phase, boostback and entry burn, and controlling the pitch angle for a vertical touchdown. 

It will be assumed that a single stage rocket takes off and lands i.e there is no stage seperation for this tutorial. You can then visualize it in FlightGear. If you do not have FlightGear, I also show you how to use MATLAB 3D Animation instead, which is just as good!

TIMESTAMPS:

00:31 - Intro and Theory
05:03 - Free Body Diagram of the Rocket
06:50 - Explaining the rocket flipping, re-entry, descent and touchdown

About the course:
This is a Free Course by Manifold AI Learning on Youtube

With the Deep learning making the breakthrough in all the fields of science and technology, Deep Learning Computer Vision is the field which is picking up at the faster rate where we see the applications in most of the applications out there.

Be it, Facebook's image tagging feature, Google Photo's People Recognition along with Scenery detection, Fraud detection, Facial Recognition, We are seeing the Deep Learning Computer Vision Applications out there. 

A typical task in Deep Learning Computer vision task will include the methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of these high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, with which we can form decisions.

A typical & basic operation we perform is - Convolution Operations on Images, where we try to learn the representations of the image so that the computer can learn the most of the data from the input images.

In this course,

We will be learning one of the widely used Deep Learning Framework, i.e PyTorch

It is said as,

PyTorch to be Goto Tool for DeepLearning for Product Prototypes as well as Academia.

We are going to prefer learning - PyTorch for these Reasons:

It is Pythonic

Easy to Learn

Higher Developer Productivity

Dynamic Approach for Graph computation - AutoGrad

GPU Support for computation, and much more...

In this course,  We are going to implement Step by Step approach of learning:

Understand Basics of PyTorch

Learn to Code in GPU & with guide to access free GPU for learning

Learn Auto Grad feature of PyTorch

Implement Deep Learning models in Pytorch

Learn the Basics of Convolutional Neural Networks in PyTorch(CNN)

Practical Application of CNN's on Real World Dataset

We believe that,

Learning will not be complete, untill you as a student has the confidence on the Subject.

So,

We have added Assignments at the end of each Section so that you can measure your progress along with learning.

We look forward to see you inside the course.

All the best.

- Learn more about MATLAB: https://bit.ly/31ewTj7

MATLAB provides professionally developed toolboxes for signal and image processing, control systems, wireless communications, computational finance, robotics, deep learning and AI, and more.

MATLAB combines a desktop environment tuned for iterative analysis and design processes with a high-level programming language that expresses matrix and array mathematics directly. It includes the Live Editor for creating scripts that combine code, output, and formatted text in an executable notebook. Prebuilt apps‚ÄØallow you to interactively perform iterative tasks. You can then automatically generate the corresponding MATLAB code to reproduce your work and add it to your script with a push of a button.

You can extend MATLAB with thousands of packages and toolboxes‚ÄØshared on GitHub, MATLAB File Exchange,‚ÄØand elsewhere.  And MATLAB code and algorithms can be deployed to run on cloud and enterprise systems, used directly in Simulink¬Æ, or automatically converted to C/C++, HDL, and CUDA code to run on embedded devices.

To be successful in this environment, team members must have broad knowledge across many different fields.
Check out various resources Brian mentions in his talk: https://bit.ly/3gk8qzg

With advancements in artificial intelligence and with engineering tools like MATLAB¬Æ and Simulink¬Æ providing more capability, the question becomes how much do you really need to understand about the underlying engineering and science versus just being able to run the algorithms?

One person can‚Äôt know everything, but it is often helpful to know something. We need some knowledge to be able to perform trade studies to see if a particular technology is worth pursuing, or to communicate with other teams outside of our own expertise, or to understand how these new technologies impact and interface with the products we‚Äôre responsible for.

Join Brian Douglas as he talks about what that knowledge looks like and how MATLAB Tech Talks, shipping examples, and documentation can go a long way to providing it.

Multilevel SEM Modeling with xxM - learn R
What you will learn in this course ?
What you'll learnSpecify, model, and estimate either: (1) multilevel SEM models using latent variables; and/or (2) multilevel regression models using only observed data: and/or (3) mixed (both observed and latent variables) multilevel path-based models.Effectively use the only software that exists in the world (which is freely provided with the course materials) capable of N-Level (any number of levels) multilevel SEM modeling.Incorporate both observed and latent variables in a data-dependent structural network both within and across levels.Incorporate any number of data-dependent levels in the SEM model.Be able to include both fixed and random effects for the observed data across any number of dependent levels.Be able to specify both random-intercept and random-slopes multilevel SEM models.
Multilevel modeling is a term alternately used to describe hierarchical linear models, nested models, mixed-effects models, random-effects models, and split-plot designs. They are statistical models for estimating parameters that vary at more than one level and which may contain both observed and latent variables at any level. They are generalizations of linear models, particularly linear regression, although they may be extended to non-linear models.xxM is an R package which can estimate multilevel SEM models characterized by complex level-dependent data structures containing both observed and latent variables. The package was developed at the University of Houston by a collaborative team headed by Dr. Paras Mehta. xxM implements a modeling framework called n-Level Structural Equation Modeling (NL-SEM) which allows the specification of models with any number of levels. Because observed and latent variables are allowed at all levels, a conventional SEM model may be specified for each level and across any levels. Also, the random-effects of observed variables are allowed both within and across levels. Mehta claims that xxM is the only software tool in the world that is capable of estimating the effects of both observed and latent variables in a SEM nomological network across an unlimited number of levels.Some of the complex dependent data structures that can be effectively modeled and estimated with xxM include:‚¶Å Hierarchically nested data (e.g. students, classrooms, schools)‚¶Å Longitudinal data (long or wide)‚¶Å Longitudinal data with switching classification (e.g. students changing classrooms)‚¶Å Cross-classified data (e.g. students nested within primary and secondary schools)‚¶Å Partial nesting (e.g. underperforming students in a classroom receive tutoring)Model specification with xxM uses a ‚ÄúLEGO-like building block‚Äù approach for model construction. With an understanding of these basic building blocks, very complex multilevel models may be constructed by repeating the same key building steps.This six-session Multilevel SEM Modeling with xxM course is an overview and tutorial of how to perform these key basic building block steps using xxM. To convey a practical understanding of implementing the core model specification and construction concepts of xxM, seven complete illustrative examples are detailed over the six class sessions. One who completes this course will then be able to construct more complex multilevel models tied to their own research projects. The seven complete examples detailed in the course begin with: (1) a streamlined two-level bivariate random-intercepts model; and (2) a two-level random-slopes model. Then a (3) multilevel confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and a (4) random-slopes multilevel CFA are detailed, followed by random-slopes (5) 'wide' and (6) 'long' latent growth curve model examples. Finally, a (7) three-level hierarchical model containing both observed and latent variables is fully demonstrated. All of the necessary software, data, manuals, slides and course materials to productively specify and estimate all seven of the course model examples are provided and included in 'resources' folders associated with the video lessons.

In this video I explain the basic of c++ which are required for starting competitive programming. I have covered how basic structure of code is, how basic input output works, variables and datatypes in c++, what are different operators, I have explained ++ and -- operators in which a lot of students face difficulty and also I have explained characters and ascii which is again a little bit confusing for beginners.


Practice questions :
- https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/cpp-hello-world/problem
- https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/c-tutorial-basic-data-types/problem ( Ignore scanf printf given in the question, use cin cout)
- https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/cpp-input-and-output/problem

As we have covered only starting topics hence practice questions are very less, once we make  progress (more 2 videos), practice questions will be a lot more.

What is Artificial Intelligence?
Artificial Intelligence is the process of building intelligent machines from vast volumes of data. Systems learn from past learning and experiences and perform human-like tasks. It enhances the speed, precision, and effectiveness of human efforts. AI uses complex algorithms and methods to build machines that can make decisions on their own. Machine Learning and Deep learning forms the core of Artificial Intelligence. 

What is Deep Learning?
Deep learning can be considered as a subset of machine learning. It is a field that is based on learning and improving on its own by examining computer algorithms. While machine learning uses simpler concepts, deep learning works with artificial neural networks, which are designed to imitate how humans think and learn. Until recently, neural networks were limited by computing power and thus were limited in complexity. However, advancements in Big Data analytics have permitted larger, sophisticated neural networks, allowing computers to observe, learn, and react to complex situations faster than humans. Deep learning has aided image classification, language translation, speech recognition. It can be used to solve any pattern recognition problem and without human intervention.

Balanced Graphs - Introduction to Graph Theory
Introduction to Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science Specialization
We invite you to a fascinating journey into Graph Theory ‚Äî an area which connects the elegance of painting and the rigor of mathematics;  is simple, but not unsophisticated. Graph Theory gives us, both an easy way to pictorially represent many major mathematical results, and insights into the deep theories behind them. 

In this course, among other intriguing applications, we will see how GPS systems find shortest routes, how engineers design integrated circuits, how biologists assemble genomes, why a political map can always be colored using a few colors. We will study Ramsey Theory which proves that in a large system, complete disorder is impossible! 

By the end of the course, we will implement an algorithm which finds an optimal assignment of students to schools. This algorithm, developed by David Gale and Lloyd S. Shapley, was later recognized by the conferral of Nobel Prize in Economics.

As prerequisites we assume only basic math (e.g., we expect you to know what is a square or how to add fractions), basic programming in python (functions, loops, recursion), common sense and curiosity. Our intended audience are all people that work or plan to work in IT, starting from motivated high school students.

I wish to thank the professors for having brought this course to Coursera, this topic is absolutely fantastic, and very well presented. I highly recommend it.,It was really good experiencing the different way of learning everything explained so properly all doubt are clear and the quiz and puzzle really helpfull
We'll focus on the graph parameters and related problems. First, we'll define graph colorings, and see why political maps can be colored in just four colors. Then we will see how cliques and independent sets are related in graphs. Using these notions, we'll prove Ramsey Theorem which states that in a large system, complete disorder is impossible! Finally, we'll study vertex covers, and learn how to find the minimum number of computers which control all network connections.

ljNQQtkNqwo,Demo 10 ‚Äì Visualizing Vector Data (Pt. II) - Rule-Based Visualizations and Labelling,Statistics Canada,https://youtube.com/watch?v=ljNQQtkNqwo,2020-12-31T16:04:23Z,"In this follow-up QGIS tutorial on visualizing vector data, we'll cover rule-based symbologies and labelling schemes, available symbology file formats and ...",en,189,4,0,0,30.0,"In this follow-up QGIS tutorial on visualizing vector data, we‚Äôll cover rule-based symbologies and labelling schemes, available symbology file formats and creating advanced labels with expression syntax. Follow along as we develop rule-based styles and symbology files with the CPRoads layer ‚Äì creating a dynamic visualization of different road classes that changes with the scale of the map canvas. Rule-based symbologies and labels are incredibly powerful in creating advanced visualizations ‚Äì enabling the specific parameters (e.g. fields, symbols, sizes, colours, outlines, and rendering scales) to be targeted for different features. A complementary skill is exporting these styles with available symbology files ‚Äì which can be independent (.qlm) or directly tied to a source layer (.qlr). These pre-defined visualization files enable layers to be rapidly visualized when opening a new project. They can also be applied to other layers with common visualization parameters (i.e. fields and attributes), such as those from a different collection period or location, and facilitate sharing visualization styles with others. Finally, we‚Äôll discuss the available label parameters (e.g. placement, scale, buffer, formatting) and discuss creating advanced labelling schemes ‚Äì specifically showing the procedures for creating multi-field labels with the Field Calculator and conditional labels using expressions. 

Stay tuned for the next demo, where we will summarize some best practices and provide tips for data management, optimizing geospatial workflows and running processing tools, as well as altering program defaults within QGIS.

First one to look into is the Natural Language Processing Specialization on Coursera. You'll learn how to implement sentiment analysis, translation, text generation and more by using word vectors and word embeddings. It's a great NLP specialization.

The second one is the Natural Language Processing Course from HSE on Coursera. This one covers a wide range of tasks in NLP such as sentiment analysis and summarization. What I like about their courses are the assignments that are challenging and exciting and in this one you'll build your own conversational chat-bot that assists with searches on StackOverflow.

The third and the one that I mostly recommend, and I'm biased here is my YouTube playlist NLP Projects 101. It has 10 videos building on top of each other from text data analysis, n-grams, bag of words and word embeddings to text classification with both logistic regression and neural networks plus explainability. Completely free, channel subscription optional but greatly appreciated.

Unsupervised Machine Learning: Cluster Analysis Algorithms - learn Data Science
Best Data Science Course
Cluster Analysis: core concepts, working, evaluation of KMeans, Meanshift, DBSCAN, OPTICS, Hierarchical clustering
Understand the KMeans Algorithm and implement it from scratch,Learn about various cluster evaluation metrics and techniques,Learn how to evaluate KMeans algorithm and choose its parameter,Learn about the limitations of original KMeans algorithm and learn variations of KMeans that solve these limitations,Understand the DBSCAN algorithm and implement it from scratch,Learn about evaluation, tuning of parameters and application of DBSCAN,Learn about the OPTICS algorithm and implement it from scratch,Learn about the cluster ordering and cluster extraction in OPTICS algorithm,Learn about evaluation, parameter tuning and application of OPTICS algorithm,Learn about the Meanshift algorithm and implement it from scratch,Learn about evaluation, parameter tuning and application of Meanshift algorithm,Learn about Hierarchical Agglomerative clustering,Learn about the single linkage, complete linkage, average linkage and Ward linkage in Hierarchical Clustering,Learn about the performance and limitations of each Linkage Criteria,Learn about applying all the clustering algorithms on flat and non-flat datasets,Learn how to do image segmentation using all clustering algorithms
Students should have some experience with Python.,Some experience with data visualizations,Some experience with Numpy,Some background in computer science.,Clustering is the activity of splitting the data into partitions that give an insight about the unlabelled data. It gives a structure to the data by grouping similar data points,,We see these clustering algorithms almost everywhere in our everyday life. Cluster Analysis has and always will be a staple for all Machine Learning. Clustering has its applications in many Machine Learning tasks: label generation, label validation, dimensionality reduction, semi supervised learning, Reinforcement learning, computer vision, natural language processing.,For a data scientist, cluster analysis is one of the first tools in their arsenal during exploratory analysis, that they use to identify natural partitions in the data.,In this course, you will learn some of the most important algorithms used for Cluster Analysis,Each dataset and feature space is unique. You cannot use a one-size-fits-all method for recognizing patterns in the data. Each algorithm has its own purpose.,By studying the core concepts and working in detail and writing the code for each algorithm from scratch, will empower you, to identify the correct algorithm to use for each scenario.,Some algorithms are fast and are a good starting point to quickly identify the pattern of the data,And some algorithms are slow but more precise, and allow you to capture the pattern very accurately.,You will get to understand each algorithm in detail, which will give you the intuition for tuning their parameters and maximizing their utility,,In this course, for cluster analysis you will learn five clustering algorithms:,You will learn about KMeans and Meanshift. These are two centroid based algorithms, which means their definition of a cluster is based around the center of the cluster.,Next you will study DBSCAN and OPTICS. These are density based algorithms, in which they find high density zones in the data and for such continuous density zones, they identify them as clusters.,Another type of algorithm that you will learn is Agglomerative Clustering, a hierarchical style of clustering algorithm, which gives us a hierarchy of clusters.,,For each algorithm, you will understand the core working of the algorithm. What parameters they use. How to choose and tune these parameters. How to evaluate the results for each algorithm. To consolidate your understanding, you will also apply all these learnings on multiple datasets for each algorithm. You can later compare all the algorithms and their performance.,,This course can be your only reference that you need, for learning about various clustering algorithms.,The correct approach to this course is going in the given order the first time.,Follow along the introductory lecture. It is highly recommended that during the coding lessons, you must code along. I have provided detailed jupyter notebooks along the course. You can keep them for reference. But it is highly recommended that you code along.,You can pause the lesson. Write the code needed and at the same time think about the working flow.,I assure you, there onwards, this course can be your go-to reference to answer all questions about these algorithms. You will have a lifetime of access to this course, and thus you can",Unsupervised Machine Learning,Agglomerative Clustering; Cluster Analysis; Coding; Computer Science; Computer Vision; Data Science; Data Visualization; Dataset; Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN); Dimensionality Reduction; Exploratory Analysis; Golang; Hierarchical Clustering; Image Segmentation; Jupyter Notebook; Microsoft Access; Natural Language Processing (NLP); NumPy; Optics; Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure (OPTICS); Python; Reinforcement Learning; Search Algorithm; Supervised Learning; Supervised Machine Learning; Unsupervised Learning; Unsupervised Machine Learning; Utility; Visualization; Writing

Unsupervised learning refers to the use of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to identify patterns in data sets containing data points that are neither classified nor labeled.

The algorithms are thus allowed to classify, label and/or group the data points contained within the data sets without having any external guidance in performing that task. Chatbots, self-driving cars, facial recognition programs, expert systems and robots are among the systems that may use either supervised or unsupervised learning approaches, or both
 
The goal of unsupervised learning is to find the underlying structure of dataset, group that data according to similarities, and represent that dataset in a compressed format.
In this session, we understand supervised learning and its types like clustering/grouping, dimensionality reduction, Matrix factorization, Anomaly detection

In the classroom we are told to endlessly study grammar and memorise concepts, however, research shows that language is acquired through authentic experiences. The concept of Nat√ºrlich German is based on Dr. Stephen Krashen's second language acquisition theory, in which one uses comprehensible input to acquire a language, rather than 'learn' it. 

What's comprehensible input?

Comprehensible language input can be either listening or reading content in your target language that is easy and comprehensible enough to understand at any level. This type of input uses slow speech, visual cues (gestures, pictures, etc.), familiar content, anything that engages you and where your brain is able to make connections to what is being said. With this method, you will notice faster progress while learning how to speak more like a native, you can build vocabulary and you will be able to apply grammar without having studied the formal rules!

Continuing from Part 1, in this Part 2 video, I explain horizontal analysis and how to perform the analysis to compare two or more periods, when there is a decrease in sales. The example income statement I use is a real life example of the income statement or profit and loss statement of Coca Cola company. So, these are real numbers we are looking at. We look at each income statement line item and one by one try to understand the performance, and identify the positives and negatives, ask questions to help understand the performance better.

Follow me as I calculate variances in amounts and percentages, and explain what they represent. Then I ask questions and make recommendations based on the analysis performed. I have seen this analysis done incorrectly in the past, so I try to share my thoughts from my practical experience of a horizontal analysis as it would be done in a real life workplace. 

Towards the end of the video, I show you how you can go to a publicly listed company's website, and download information such as their financial statements and analysis of gross profit margin and operating margin.

Performance for our GME RL Bot was...meh

You're probably thinking, ""There has to be a way to perform better!""

Wellllll, there sure is!

In this video you're going to learn how to create your own custom financial technical indicators for use in a Python Reinforcement Learning bot. And, we're going to use it to trade Gamestop ($GME) stocks in spite of the short squeeze. We'll calculate the relative strength index (RSI), simple moving average (SMA) and on-balance volume (OBV) indicators and use it to train the reinforcement learning model powered by stable baselines.  

Whilst we've shown it used for trading Gamestop - GME, you could use it to trade AMC Entertainment, Bitcoin BTC and so on. The awesome thing about the gym0anytrading environment is that it makes it a ton easier to leverage it with your own trading style or strategy.  

In this video, you'll learn how to:
1. Calculate RSI, OBV and SMA using the Python package Finta for technical analysis
2. Integrate new trading indicators into the gym-anytrading GME Trading Environment for Reinforcement Learning
3. Train a reinforcement learning model to trade using the newly calculated indicators

This guide does not assume any prior exposure to R, programming or data science. It is intended for beginners with an interest in data science and those who might know other programming languages and would like to learn R.

I will create the videos for this guide such that you should be able to learn a lot just watching on YouTube, but to get the most out of the guide, it is recommended that you create a Kaggle account so that you can fork and edit each lesson so that you can follow along and run code yourself.

What Exactly is Machine Learning?
A good start at a Machine Learning definition is that it is a core sub-area of Artificial Intelligence (AI). ML applications learn from experience (well data) like humans without direct programming. When exposed to new data, these applications learn, grow, change, and develop by themselves. 

What is Supervised Learning?
In supervised learning, we use known or labeled data for the training data. Since the data is known, the learning is, therefore, supervised, i.e., directed into successful execution. The input data goes through the Machine Learning algorithm and is used to train the model. 

What is Unsupervised Learning?
In unsupervised learning, the training data is unknown and unlabeled - meaning that no one has looked at the data before. Without the aspect of known data, the input cannot be guided to the algorithm, which is where the unsupervised term originates from. This data is fed to the Machine Learning algorithm and is used to train the model. The trained model tries to search for a pattern and give the desired response. In this case, it is often like the algorithm is trying to break code like the Enigma machine but without the human mind directly involved but rather a machine.

What is Reinforcement Learning?
Like traditional types of data analysis, here, the algorithm discovers data through a process of trial and error and then decides what action results in higher rewards. Three major components make up reinforcement learning: the agent, the environment, and the actions. The agent is the learner or decision-maker, the environment includes everything that the agent interacts with, and the actions are what the agent does.

Whereas sentiment analysis is only one dimensional (positive/negative), emotion detection represents many as three dimensions (aka, the valence-arousal-dominance [VAD]  spectrum). People express emotions through their speech, facial expressions, gestures, and writings. There are several ways to computationally represent emotions: treat them as discrete categories, such as happiness or sadness, or using the VAD spectrum. 

Emotion detection can significantly increase the effectiveness of applications such as opinion mining or diagnosis of various mental disorders from human-generated content.

In this talk we will focus on emotion detection from text and cover some of existing emotion-detection techniques, available datasets, and the challenges of building a production-level emotion detection system.

1) Linearity: There must be a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables.
2) Homoscedasticity: The residuals must have a constant variance.
3) Normality: The residuals must be normally distributed.
4) No Multicollinearity: No high correlation between the independent variables

Linearity:
In linear regression, a straight line is placed through the data. This straight line should represent all points as good as possible. If the relation is nonlinear the straight line cannot fulfill this requirement.

Normal distribution of the error:
One assumption of linear Regression is that the error epsilon must be normally distributed,
To check this there are two ways, one is the analytical way and the other is the graphical way.

Homoscedasticity:
A assumption for linear regression is that the residuals have a constant variance.
Since your regression model never exactly predicts your dependent variable in practice, you always have an error. Now you can plot your dependent variable on the x axis and the error on the y axis.

Multicollinearity:
In multicollinearity, two or more of the predictors correlate strongly with each other.

Abstract:
A/B testing is the gold standard for experimentation, but in practice randomization is not always feasible when certain biases are in play. It is common then for data scientists to leverage quasi-experimental methods to measure average treatment effects. In this talk we‚Äôll go through examples of industry applications within ridesharing and edtech, where methods such as difference-in-differences, synthetic controls and counterfactual analysis and estimation were used to infer causality.

So, why do I tell people not to learn it?

There are multiple reasons for this, but the biggest is that Python doesn't provide a path to success. It is a tool and can be used for many things, but it is not ideal if you are a new programmer.

New programmers should pick a path, especially the paths I list in this video.

Email A/B testing, also known as split testing, is an awesome way to find out what resonates with your subscribers. Rather than guessing whether your subscribers would prefer one kind of email over another, you can run a split test to find out. This can help you increase your open rates, click-through rates, and sales.

With email A/B testing, you can create and send different versions of an email to smaller percentages of subscribers to determine which one performs best. Once you find the version that performs best, you can send the winning version to the remainder of your subscribers.

The more you split test, the more information you‚Äôll have on hand for your future emails.

You can use these policies to implement controllers and decision-making algorithms for complex applications such as resource allocation, robotics, and autonomous systems.

The toolbox lets you represent policies and value functions using deep neural networks or look-up tables and train them through interactions with environments modeled in MATLAB¬Æ or Simulink. You can evaluate the single- or multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms provided in the toolbox or develop your own. You can experiment with hyperparameter settings, monitor training progress, and simulate trained agents either interactively through the app or programmatically. To improve training performance, simulations can be run in parallel on multiple CPUs, GPUs, computer clusters, and the cloud (with Parallel Computing Toolbox‚Ñ¢ and MATLAB Parallel Server‚Ñ¢).

Through the ONNX‚Ñ¢ model format, existing policies can be imported from deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow‚Ñ¢ Keras and PyTorch (with Deep Learning Toolbox‚Ñ¢). You can generate optimized C, C++, and CUDA¬Æ code to deploy trained policies on microcontrollers and GPUs. The toolbox includes reference examples to help you get started.

Machine learning and AI models are growing increasingly available, but many models offer predictions that are difficult to understand, evaluate and ultimately act upon. We present how interactive visualization can be used to amplify people‚Äôs ability to understand and interact with large-scale data and complex models. We sample from projects where interactive visualization has provided key leaps of insight: Summit and Bluff, systems that scalably summarize and visualize what features a deep learning and how they may be exploited by attacks; SkeletonVis, the first interactive tool that visualizes attacks on human action recognition models; CNN Explainer and GAN Lab (with Google Brain), popular tools for students and experts alike to learn about AI models; Argo Lite, for easy in-browser visualization and sharing of graph visualizations used by thousands of students; CardiacAR, for interactive cardiovascular surgical planning leveraging augmented reality. We conclude by highlighting the next visual analytics research frontiers for data discoveries and AI.

Data helps find opportunities and resolve misunderstandings. These 5 visualizations‚Äîthe works of Snow, Rosling, Minard, Nightingale, and Priestley‚Äîare evidence of that. They influenced people‚Äôs thoughts and actions at critical points in history, making an impact on the world around us.


We can learn a lot about the future of data visualization by looking at the past. These visualizations are still relevant today and continue to teach us about the power of data storytelling.

Natural Language Processing, popularly known in its abbreviated form NLP, is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that deals with the interaction between humans and computers using the natural language. Its ultimate objective is to meet, understand, and make sense of the human language. NLP is that branch of AI that helps computers to interpret, understand and manipulate the human language. NLP helps developers to structure and organize information to perform tasks such as speech recognition, translation, summarization, relationship extraction, etc. NLP is a way for computers to understand, analyze, and derive meaning from human languages.

Great Learning brings you this beginner-friendly tutorial on Natural Language Processing to help you understand everything you need to know about this topic and getting started on the journey to learn about it well. This video starts with an introduction to NLP, followed by understanding topics such as tokenization, normalization and stemming. Then we look at sentence segmentation and phrase identification. Following this, we will understand the topic of word sense disambiguation. Finally, we look at parsing! This video teaches NLP and its key functions and concepts with a variety of demonstrations & examples to help you get started on the right foot.

Machine learning encompasses many different ideas, programming languages, frameworks, and approaches to the subject, so the term ""machine learning"" is difficult to define in just a sentence or two. But essentially, machine learning is giving a computer the ability to write its own rules and learn about new things, on its own. In this course, we'll explore some of the big ideas, and toward the end, we'll even write a little bit of code in Python that can make some intelligent predictions.

What you'll learn:
- Fundamental concepts in machine learning
- Supervised versus Unsupervised learning
- Machine learning frameworks
- Machine learning using Python and scikit-learn

We are going to learn the introduction of machine learning and linear regression in R 4.0 programming. We will start with the introduction of machine learning then we will discuss the introduction of linear regression. I will also discuss types of linear regression and use cases of linear regression. there are two types of linear regression; simple linear regression and multiple linear regression. Use cases of linear regression are in house price prediction, stock price prediction, Twitter popularity prediction. I will thereafter show you how to analyze the Boston housing dataset. We will analyze dataset variables to understand the variable dependency for the linear regression model. I will show you the linear and non-linear regression models. Thereafter, I will show how you can improve the accuracy of a linear regression model.

Or, better said, visual scripting or coding? Which one should you use? In this video, we will give that an answer.

This question is - perhaps - one of the most asked questions by beginners. Blueprints are a great system that can achieve a lot, and has been evolving a lot over the past few years, but can it really compete with C++? The ""Blueprints vs C++"" debate is not at all straightforward and there are many factors to consider, such as job opportunities. So, today, we'll go over what you should think about before choosing C++ or blueprints.

What is Artificial Intelligence?
Artificial Intelligence or AI is the combination of algorithms used for the purpose of creating intelligent machines that have the same skills as a human being. It uses machine learning and deep learning techniques to build complex systems. AI has made significant advances in the past few years and has impacted both our everyday lives and business in big ways. It is being widely used in every sector of business, such as Healthcare, E-Commerce, Manufacturing, Retail, and Logistics.

Simplilearn‚Äôs Artificial Intelligence course provides training in the skills required for a career in AI. You will master TensorFlow, Machine Learning and other AI concepts, plus the programming languages needed to design intelligent agents, deep learning algorithms & advanced artificial neural networks that use predictive analytics to solve real-time decision-making problems without explicit programming.

Why learn Artificial Intelligence? 
The current and future demand for AI engineers is staggering. The New York Times reports a candidate shortage for certified AI Engineers, with fewer than 10,000 qualified people in the world to fill these jobs, which according to Paysa earn an average salary of $172,000 per year in the U.S. (or Rs.17 lakhs to Rs. 25 lakhs in India) for engineers with the required skills.

You can gain in-depth knowledge of Artificial Intelligence by taking our Artificial Intelligence certification training course. Those who complete the course will be able to: 
1. Master the concepts of supervised and unsupervised learning
2. Gain practical mastery over principles, algorithms, and applications of machine learning through a hands-on approach which includes working on 28 projects and one capstone project.
3. Acquire thorough knowledge of the mathematical and heuristic aspects of machine learning.
4. Understand the concepts and operation of support vector machines, kernel SVM, naive bayes, decision tree classifier, random forest classifier, logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors, K-means clustering and more.
5. Comprehend the theoretical concepts and how they relate to the practical aspects of machine learning.
6. Be able to model a wide variety of robust machine learning algorithms including deep learning, clustering, and recommendation systems

Time series has become one of the most important aspect for data representation and analysis. It is a series of data points in time order which is taken at successive equally spaced points in time. In this tutorial we'll be exploring the concept and application of Time Series in Stock Market. 

Forecasting methods like exponential smoothing, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) etc. will be discussed in this video so as to give you a good idea about various time series forecasting methods.

A time series is a sequence of observations over a certain period. A univariate time series consists of the values taken by a single variable at periodic time instances over a period, and a multivariate time series consists of the values taken by multiple variables at the same periodic time instances over a period. The analysis of temporal data is capable of giving us useful insights on how a variable changes over time, or how it depends on the change in the values of other variables (s). This relationship of a variable on its previous values and/or other variables can be analyzed for time series forecasting and has numerous applications.

Following pointers will be covered in this video:
00:00:00 Introduction 
00:01:26 Indices 
00:14:36 Simple Exponential Smoothing 
00:43:06 ARIMA Approach 
01:13:49 Comparing Models

You will learn how to query database systems via languages such as SQL (the structured query language). Then, you will see how database systems work internally, how they store and index data, how they process and optimize queries, and how they process transactions while providing guarantees such as isolation, atomicity, and durability (ACID guarantees).

The course addresses questions of database design and discusses novel approaches to data management via NoSQL or NewSQL systems. Finally, the course will discuss about graph, stream, and spatial data, and about systems that are specialized for those data types. The lectures are from the Fall 2020 online lecture at Cornell by Prof. Trummer (www.itrummer.org).

A comprehensive look at the wide landscape of database systems and how to make a good choice in your next project
The first time we ask or answer any question regarding databases is when building an application. The next is either when our choice of database becomes a bottleneck or when we need to do large-scale data analytics.This course covers almost all classes of databases or data storage platform there are and when to consider using them. It is a great journey through databases that will be great for software developers, big data engineers,¬†data analysts as well as decision makers. It is not an in-depth look into each of the databases but promises to get you up and running with your first project for each class.In this course, we are going to cover¬†Relational Database Systems, their features, use cases and limitationsWhy NoSQL?CAP TheoremKey-Value store and their use casesDocument-oriented databases and their use casesWide-columnar store and their use casesTime-series databases and their use casesSearch Engines and their use casesGraph databases and their use casesDistributed Logs and real time streaming systemsHadoop and its use casesSQL-on-Hadoop tools and their use casesHow to make informed decisions in building a good data storage platform
What is the target audience?Chief data officersApplication developerData analystData architectsData engineersStudentsAnyone who wants to understand Hadoop from a database perspective.
What this course does not cover?This course does not access any of the databases from the administrative perspective. So we don't cover administrative tasks like security, backup, recovery, migration and the likes.
Very in-depth features in the specific databases in discussion. An example is that we will not go into the different database engines for MySQL or how to write a stored procedures.¬†
What are the requirements?
The lab for this course can be carried out in any machine (Microsoft Windows, Linux, Mac OX).¬†
However, the training on HBase or Hadoop will require you to have a hadoop environment. The suggestion for this will be to to use a pre-installed sandbox, a cloud offering or install your own custom sandbox.
What do I need to know to get the best out of this course?
This course does not assume any knowledge of NoSQL or data engineering.
However a little knowledge of RDBMS (even Microsoft Access) is enough to get you into the best position for this course.

DAX is a formula language with functions.",en,109917,2981,27,158,14.0,"In this step-by-step tutorial for beginners, learn how to use DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) in Microsoft Power BI. DAX is a formula language with functions. If you've ever written formulas in Excel, you'll find that DAX is very familiar.

We'll start by loading the sample data into a data model. Next, we establish relationships between the various tables.

Once the setup is complete, we'll write our first measure. A measure is a calculation that runs across our data model. You'll learn about a few different functions, including sum and count. You'll also learn how to comment your expressions.

Next, we create a measure using operators, like addition, subtraction, division, and multiplication. We then dive into how you can create measures using a graphical user interface called Quick Measures.

We then move onto creating a calculated column and talk about the advantages and disadvantages of columns vs. measures.

We then dig into iterator functions and when you would use them compared to an aggregator function. Iterator functions include sumx, countx, averagex, maxx, minx, and rankx.

Next, we look at the date functions that are available and we use the one called weekday.

We wrap up by looking at some logical functions, including find, if, and calculate.

Welcome to this video on the course structure of time series analysis. Since time series analysis consists of different models, we have tried to structure them in a simple format. The course is divided into four parts.
The first part covers the basic concepts of time series such as returns, linear regression and correlation. You can skip this section if you are aware of them. However, we strongly recommend you to go through them for revision purpose.
In part 2, you will move towards the time series forecasting models. These include the autoregression and moving average models.
In part 3, you will look at volatility and volatility forecasting models.
Finally in part 4, you will work on a capstone project,  and also learn about the limitations as well as the future enhancement for time series analysis.
In Part 1, initially, you will learn what constitutes time series and what does not. Further, you will learn about different types of returns, including cumulative and log returns. After these concepts, you will go through the four components of the time series. Note that noise will be covered later in the course.
Further, you will also learn about linear regression models, which is the foundation for autoregression models. A major requirement of certain time series models is stationary input. You will understand the basic concept of stationarity. And how to convert non-stationary to stationary input.
You will get to know about correlation and its impact on linear regression. Further, the auto correlation function and Partial autocorrelation function plot tells us how data points in a time series are related to the preceding data points.
With these concepts under your belt, you will move to the second part of the course. To make sure that your learning is smooth, we will start with simple time series analysis models.
You will first look at the autoregression (AR) and moving average (MA) models. You will learn how to construct these forecasting models as well as their limitations. Next, you will move further in the ARMA family of models, namely ARIMA and SARIMA.
You can apply your learning in real world as live trading integration is also provided for all strategies.
So far, we focused on price data as our variable to predict. Another class of time series models are the volatility forecasting models. These models are covered in part 3 of the course.
You will first understand the concept of volatility and its stylised facts. Further, you will develop the ARCH and GARCH models. These models will help you trade the VIX index of the US markets through VXX ETN.
The assets used in the course are specific but the models can be applied to any market and are thus universal in nature.
You will then move to part 4, where you will be able to work on a capstone project. This will help you apply your knowledge. Further, you will look at future enhancements to the models used in the course. A brief on the limitations of time series analysis is also included.
Finally, you will wrap with the summary of the concepts and time series models studied in the course.
We have provided all the files and codes which can be downloaded for your benefit. An html version of the course structure is provided in the next unit, and can be used as a reference while doing the course.

What Exactly is Machine Learning?
A good start at a Machine Learning definition is that it is a core sub-area of Artificial Intelligence (AI). ML applications learn from experience (well data) like humans without direct programming. When exposed to new data, these applications learn, grow, change, and develop by themselves. In other words, with Machine Learning, computers find insightful information without being told where to look. Instead, they do this by leveraging algorithms that learn from data in an iterative process.

What is Artificial Intelligence?
Artificial Intelligence is a method of making a computer, a computer-controlled robot, or software think intelligently like the human mind. AI is accomplished by studying the patterns of the human brain and by analyzing the cognitive process. The outcome of these studies develops intelligent software and systems.

REGRESSION ANALYSIS:- In regression analysis, we are concerned with the estimation of one variable for a given value of another variable (or for a given set of values of a number of variables) on the basis of an average mathematical relationship between the two variables (or a number of variables). Regression analysis plays a very important role in the field of every human activity. A businessman may be keen to know what would be his estimated profit for a given level of investment on the basis of the past records. 

Simple regression is used to examine the relationship between one dependent and one independent
variable. After performing an analysis, the regression statistics can be used to predict the dependent
variable when the independent variable is known.

‚óâ The regression line (known as the least-squares line) is a plot of the expected value of the dependent variable for all values of the independent variable. Technically, it is the line that ""minimizes the squared residuals"". The regression line is the one that best fits the data on a scatterplot.

‚óâ Using the regression equation, the dependent variable may be predicted from the independent variable. The slope of the regression line (b) is defined as the rise divided by the run. The y-intercept (a) is the point on the y-axis where the regression line would intercept the y-axis. The slope and y-intercept are incorporated into the regression equation. The intercept is usually called the constant, and the slope is referred to as the coefficient. Since the regression model is usually not a perfect predictor, there is also an error term in the equation.

‚óâ In the regression equation, y is always the dependent variable and x is always the independent variable.

‚óâ Here is a way to mathematically describe a linear regression model: y = a + bx + e

‚óâ The significance of the slope of the regression line is determined from the t-statistic. It is the probability that the observed correlation coefficient occurred by chance if the true correlation is zero.

‚óâ Some researchers prefer to report the F-ratio instead of the t-statistic. The F-ratio is equal to the t-statistic squared.

‚óâ The t-statistic is equal to the estimated coefficient divided by its standard error.

So far all we have ...,en-GB,19821,293,55,83,13.0,"The Nature of Life is an epic documentary feature film that will provide solutions to humanity‚Äôs greatest challenge yet - Global Climate Change. So far all we have heard is that climate change is the biggest ever environmental crisis and that it has been caused by our unsustainable approach to living. The Nature of Life, however, sets out as a greatly inspired clarion call to humanity, telling us that there is hope and that there are ways to adapt to and overcome this crisis.

This documentary encapsulates a vision of hope that stems from the heart of Africa and expands globally, highlighting ground-breaking examples of sustainable development all over the world, inspired by the examples of Africa and the natural world. The microcosm of the ‚Äúcradle of civilisation‚Äù, Africa, will spill into the entire world, introducing the audience to a group of extraordinary humans and companies who are challenging past models of sustainability and creating a new legacy of elegant design, technology, and rediscovered indigenous wisdom.

With the Deep learning making the breakthrough in all the fields of science and technology, Deep Learning Computer Vision is the field which is picking up at the faster rate where we see the applications in most of the applications out there.

Be it, Facebook's image tagging feature, Google Photo's People Recognition along with Scenery detection, Fraud detection, Facial¬†Recognition, We are seeing the Deep Learning Computer Vision Applications out there. 

A typical task in Deep Learning Computer vision task will include the methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of these high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, with which we can form decisions.

A typical & basic operation we perform is - Convolution Operations on Images, where we try to learn the representations of the image so that the computer can learn the most of the data from the input images.

In this course,

We will be learning one of the widely used Deep Learning Framework, i.e PyTorch

It is said as,

PyTorch to be Goto¬†Tool for DeepLearning for Product Prototypes as well as Academia.

We are going to prefer learning - PyTorch for these Reasons:

It is Pythonic

Easy to¬†Learn

Higher Developer Productivity

Dynamic Approach for Graph computation - AutoGrad

GPU Support for computation, and much more...

In this course,¬† We are going to implement Step by Step approach of learning:

Understand Basics of PyTorch

Learn to Code in GPU & with guide to access free GPU for learning

Learn Auto Grad feature of PyTorch

Implement Deep Learning models in Pytorch

Learn the¬†Basics of Convolutional Neural Networks in PyTorch(CNN)

Practical Application of CNN's on Real World Dataset

We believe that,

Learning will not be complete, untill you as a student has the confidence on the Subject.

So,

We have added Assignments at the end of each Section so that you can measure your progress along with learning.

We look forward to see you inside the course.

All the best.

ywCFac5Gch0,Warren Buffett and the Interpretation of Financial Statements by Mary Buffett FULL AUDIOBOOK!,Hightower Investing and History Network,https://youtube.com/watch?v=ywCFac5Gch0,2020-11-26T02:02:08Z,Warren Buffett and the Interpretation of Financial Statements: The Search for the Company with a Durable Competitive Advantage bu Mary Buffett and David ...,,187002,3433,132,206,18.0,"Warren Buffett and the Interpretation of Financial Statements: The Search for the Company with a Durable Competitive Advantage bu Mary Buffett and David Clark


With an insider's view of the mind of the master, Mary Buffett and David Clark have written a simple guide for reading financial statements from Warren Buffett's succccessful perspective.

Buffett and Clark clearly outline Warren Buffett's strategies in a way that will appeal to newcomers and seasoned Buffettologists alike. Inspired by the seminal work of Buffett's mentor, Benjamin Graham (The Interpretation of Financial Statements, 1937), this book presents Buffett's interpretation of financial statements with anecdotes and quotes from the master investor himself.

Potential investors will discover:

‚Ä¢ Buffett's time-tested dos and don'ts for interpreting an income statement and balance sheet
‚Ä¢ Why high research and development costs can kill a great business
‚Ä¢ How much debt Buffett thinks a company can carry before it becomes too dangerous to touch
‚Ä¢ The financial ratios and calculations that Buffett uses to identify the company with a durable competitive advantage -- which he believes makes for the winning long-term investment
‚Ä¢ How Buffett uses financial statements to value a company
‚Ä¢ What kinds of companies Warren stays away from no matter how cheap their selling price

Once readers complete and master Buffett's simple financial calculations and methods for interpreting a company's financial statement, they'll be well on their way to identifying which companies are going to be tomorrow's winners -- and which will be the losers they should avoid at all costs.

Destined to become a classic in the world of investment books, Warren Buffett and the Interpretation of Financial Statements is the perfect companion volume to The New Buffettology and The Tao of Warren Buffett.",Financial Statements,Balance Sheet; Financial Statement; Income Statement; Investment; Research and Development (R&D)

Deep learning community has largely evolved independently from the prior community of data science and machine learning community in NumPy. While most deep learning frameworks now provide NumPy-like math and array library, they differ in the definition of the operations which creates a steeper learning curve of deep learning for machine learning practitioners and data scientists. This creates a chasm not only in the skillsets of the two different communities, but also hinders the exchange of knowledge. The next major version, 2.0, of Apache MXNet (incubating) seeks to bridge the fragmented deep learning and machine learning ecosystem. It provides NumPy-compatible programming experiences and simple enhancements to NumPy for deep learning with the new Gluon 2.0 interface. The NumPy-compatible array API also brings the advances in GPU acceleration, auto-differentiation, and high-performance one-click deployment to the NumPy ecosystem.",APACHE,Amazon Web Service (AWS); Apache; Application Programming Interface (API); Array; Data Science; Deep Learning; Differentiation; Graphics Processing Unit (GPU); Machine Learning; NumPy

Data is crucial in training, testing, validating, and evaluating machine learning algorithms. As the popularity of AI/ML continues to rise due to the combination of plentiful cloud computing and the availability of big data to train machine learning models, so does the need for good quality data. The more quality data used to train the algorithms, the higher predictive power trained machine learning models can deliver. This is why there are numerous studies, surveys, and reports indicating that most data scientists spend the majority (as high as 80%) of their time on data preparation and cleaning data.    Data cleaning and preparation is a critical step in any machine learning project. Preparing data judiciously and accurately is crucial in order to enable successful machine learning projects. Before utilizing data to train a machine learning model, it‚Äôs important to ensure that it is clean, consistent, and accurate.        In this session, we will provide an overview of steps and techniques for sourcing, preparing, transforming, and cleaning data for data science projects, and best practices for building effective data preparation implementation.

Deep learning drives the so-called third wave of artificial intelligence (AI) and has dominated many automated tasks. However, what is deep learning? Why is it called ‚Äúdeep‚Äù learning? This webinar presents a general introduction to deep learning models, i.e., from artificial neural networks (ANN) to deep neural networks (DNN). 

Three major types of deep learning models will be covered, including convolution neural networks (CNN) mainly used in computer vision, recurrent neural networks (RNN) mainly targeting time-series problems, and the latest Transformer that can be used in both computer vision and time-series analysis. Their extensions, e.g., different CNN architectures, RNN extensions (GRU, LSTM), Transformer based (BERT for language modeling and DETR, ViT for computer vision), and their typical applications will also be introduced. Finally, a general pipeline of applying deep learning to practical problems will be presented.

About the presenter:
Dr. Junyong You is a Senior Researcher at Norwegian Research Centre AS. He has a wide range of R&D experience with data analysis, artificial intelligence, computer vision, and applications in multimedia, energy, aquaculture, energy, etc. His research interests include machine learning, semantic multimedia content analysis, visual attention mechanism and modeling, and multimedia quality of experience management. He is the author or co-author of more than 70 scientific articles published in books, premier conferences, and journals.

A time series is simply a set of data points ordered in time. Therefore, time is the independent variable.

We can divide a time series into 4 different components. We have the level, which is the average value of the time series. Then, we have trend, which is the process that makes the values increase or decrease over time. Seasonality is a repeated cycle over time. Finally, we have noise, which adds randomness to the series. We will see how each component will guide us in our process of analysis and forecasting.

Our objective in time series analysis is often to predict the future, but we might be interested in understanding different components of the time series, such as seasonality, or if there is autoregression. Of course, we will dive into those topics in depth later on.

For now, let‚Äôs look at some examples of time series. Here, we see a simulated random walk, meaning that your time series is completely random! There is no real reason as to why it goes up or down.

Here is another example of time series, where we have both an autoregressive and moving average processes in play. In time, we will go over what that means, and how to simulate those processes.

Finally, here is a real dataset, which is the quarterly earnings per share of the company Johnson&Johnson. Notice, the trend here, since it goes upward. Also, we notice some seasonality, as the values go up and down, in a cyclical fashion. Those are all important elements that we will learn to identify and how that will impact our analysis.",Time Series Analysis,Dataset; Email; Forecasting; Golang; Moving Average; Objective-C; Play; Python; TensorFlow; Time Series Analysis; Variable
