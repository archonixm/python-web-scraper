Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images By Sara Castellanos Close Sara Castellanos Biography @SCastellWSJ sara.castellanos@wsj.com Sept. 9, 2021 4:11 pm ET Information-technology leaders say they are boosting compensation packages and flexible work options to widen the pool of prospective job candidates, as demand surges for tech talent. The IT job market in the U.S. has added an average of about 13,000 positions during each month of 2021 so far, up from a typical monthly average of between 5,000 and 8,000 jobs, said Victor Janulaitis, chief executive of Utah-based consulting firm Janco Associates Inc., which analyzes data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Growth in the IT job market has been largely driven by the push toward digital initiatives such as e-commerce during the pandemic, as well as the need for cybersecurity experts, he said. Overall demand for workers in the U.S. remained strong, with postings on job-search site Indeed.com up about 39% at the end of August from February 2020, The Wall Street Journal previously reported . Newsletter Sign-up WSJ | CIO Journal The Morning Download delivers daily insights and news on business technology from the CIO Journal team. PREVIEW SUBSCRIBE Data from the Labor Department showed there were 10.9 million unfilled jobs at the end of July, when the Delta variant surge started, exceeding the 8.7 million Americans who were unemployed and seeking jobs that month. To recruit employees and retain existing tech staff, IT leaders say they are offering flexible work options, such as a combination of in-person and remote work. The median salary for IT professionals is expected to grow to between $96,000 and $97,000, up from $94,600 in January and $95,600 in June, Mr. Janulaitis said. “The talent market is very competitive and becoming more so, given the continuing importance of digital transformation and digital business models,” said Arthur Hu, chief information officer of personal computer-maker Lenovo Group Ltd., which currently has hundreds of IT job openings. Positions such as technical product managers are in high demand and sometimes difficult to fill, said Mr. Hu, adding that he often sources “nontraditional” candidates who might come from a different industry, geography or discipline. Prakash Kota, CIO of Autodesk Photo: Autodesk “Good ideas can come from anywhere,” he said. Software company Autodesk Inc. has hired about 250 IT staffers since the start of the pandemic in early 2020, said Prakash Kota, the company’s CIO. The IT group has not recruited at that rate before, he said. He attributes the hiring push to the company’s goal of insourcing technology talent related to artificial intelligence, data science and cloud computing, Mr. Kota said. Data science jobs are difficult roles to fill, he said. The company offers competitive pay and the option of a mix of in-person and remote work to recruit IT staff, he said. “Culture plays a significant role” in hiring and retaining talent, he said. For example, it is important to ensure that IT staff members feel like they are contributing to important initiatives and making an impact on the business. Talent is a top priority for Rob Alexander, CIO of Capital One Financial Corp., which aims to hire more than 3,000 technologists by year’s end. Many of those roles include software engineers focused on cloud computing, data, machine learning and cybersecurity. Rob Alexander, CIO of Capital One Photo: Capital One To differentiate itself from competitors and attract top technology talent, the bank has been putting an emphasis on continuous learning, diversity and workplace culture, Mr. Alexander said. The company is also using its migration to Amazon Web Services, Amazon.com Inc.’s public cloud, as a selling point for new hires because it allows engineers to focus on building and deploying new applications and services quickly while using the latest software tools. “For me and my leadership team, our highest calling is to build a world-class technology team and to unleash the potential of that talent,” Mr. Alexander said. Cathleen Southwick, CIO at Pure Storage Inc., a data-management and storage firm, said it is tough to find qualified candidates, particularly software engineers, in the U.S. and globally. The Mountain View, Calif.-based company is competing against other Silicon Valley giants for technology talent. Pure Storage tries to entice prospective employees by offering a flexible work style on a case-by-case basis, as well as competitive compensation packages. Ms. Southwick said the company also offers certification programs in areas such as cloud and IT services, to make IT staffers aware that the company is investing in their careers. IT leaders will need to play a pivotal role in recruiting and retaining talent in the competitive job market, she said. “We’re going to have to keep reinventing how, where and what we offer to employees, whether it’s our benefits, flexibility or locations,” she said.

Global ATP Chair John Kleeman, Founder of Questionmark, in emphasizing the importance of this year’s virtual Security Summit focusing on Artificial Intelligence, had this to say: “In reality, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a confusing and sometimes misunderstood term. Many testing organizations are planning or using AI, others are using algorithmic or automated decision-making. All of us need to be aware of the potential benefit but also the risks of bias and the threat of regulation of AI and of other algorithms in assessment. We need to be asking how AI can help in assessment, what is its future and how can we be responsible using it?"" To understand and address these questions, Kleeman noted, the first challenge is to truly grasp what AI is, and what it means within the assessment industry.  “The ATP community is leading the conversation on responsible use of AI in assessment. And that’s what this year’s two-day Summit is about – to understand, to parse out the complexities, and to influence where AI is going…or perhaps, where it is taking us,” Kleeman remarked. The Summit begins even before it opens – with a pre-read ATP White Paper assigned to all attendees: Artificial Intelligence and the Testing Industry: A Primer,  which is available on the ATP website at www.testpublishers.org . Then, building upon the wave of information about AI that has been made available over the past year, the two-day Summit will: •	Engage in discussions on test security, privacy, compliance challenges, and opportunities at play when building and administering tests using AI and automated decision-making; and •	Provide actionable steps testing programs, test publishers, and industry service providers can take to address them. Kleeman noted, “this really is an opportunity to learn how to responsibly use AI in assessment from industry professionals specializing in test creation, security, technology, and privacy.” This year's Summit program, (which can be accessed online at http://eatpconference.org/security-summit-agenda.aspx ) includes speakers from industry leaders such as Microsoft, Duolingo, and Multi-Health Systems, Inc. and will address the theme with sessions focusing on the ethical use of AI to improve security, the future of regulating the use of AI, and strategies to educate public policy makers about how AI can be responsibly managed in the assessment industry. Registration and sponsorship is open at: http://eatpconference.org/register.aspx [Registration for the Summit can be as a stand alone event, or combined with a registration to ATP’s virtual European ATP Conference being held a week later, 27 – 29 September, 2021.] About the ATP and the ATP Security Committee Established in 1992, Global ATP is an international, non-profit, trade organization representing providers of tests and assessment tools and/or services related to assessment for clinical, occupational, certification, licensing, educational or other similar uses. The ATP Security Committee provides a forum to encourage assessment organizations to collaborate in addressing test security concerns. The goals of the Committee are to: (1) identify methods to improve test security; (2) establish and disseminate security best practices; and (3) protect the integrity of assessments and assessment programs. By focusing on industry needs and providing solutions, we are creating a resource center for ATP members to access information and assistance for implementing or improving security efforts and programs.

Today, much robotic technology is developed without considering its potentially harmful effects on society, including how these technologies can infringe on privacy or further economic inequity. The new UT Austin program will fill an important educational gap by prioritizing these issues in its curriculum. “In the next 10 years, we are going to live more closely alongside robots, and we want to be sure that those robots are fair, inclusive and free from bias,” said Junfeng Jiao, associate professor in the School of Architecture and the program lead. “And because the robots we create are reflections of ourselves, it is imperative that technologists receive an excellent ethics education. We want our students to work directly with companies to create practices and technologies that are equitable and fair.” Called CREATE (Convergent, Responsible, and Ethical AI Training Experience for Roboticists), it will offer graduate coursework and professional development in responsible design and implementation. CREATE is a collaboration among Texas Robotics, industry partners and the UT grand challenge research initiative Good Systems , which seeks to design AI technologies that benefit society. The program has been recently awarded a $3 million grant from the National Science Foundation through its Research Traineeship Program , which will support 32 doctoral students to receive coursework, mentorship, professional development, internships, and research and public service opportunities. Students will focus specifically on how to ethically design, develop and deploy service robots, which can make deliveries, work in factories and clean homes. They will consider factors such as how to design delivery service robots so they are more inclusive and can reach all people and how to ensure home service robots protect occupants’ privacy. Several notable robotics companies have also said they will offer students internships, including Sony AI, Bosch, Amazon, SparkCognition and Apptronik. Researchers involved in the program cross many disciplines at UT, including computer science, architecture, engineering, information, and public affairs. Faculty members from these units will teach courses as part of the curriculum, and two faculty members will mentor each trainee during the five-year program. Additionally, each trainee will receive help with career development, grant writing, and exposure to local startup companies. More than half of the program’s trainees will be chosen from underrepresented groups in STEM education, including women and racial minorities, to help bring much-needed diversity to the field of robotics. The coursework component, which includes five classes in ethical robotics, will be institutionalized as a graduate portfolio program and will be available to all STEM graduate students at UT Austin. “This program will enable us to educate well-rounded roboticists who are not only grounded in the technical details of designing and building autonomous robots but also are equipped to fully consider the societal implications of their work,” said Peter Stone, director of Texas Robotics and a professor of computer science. “That is a missing part in robotics education in the U.S. and the world. We believe this is a game changer for the future of robotics.” Copy link Email Share Link Twitter Share Link Facebook Share Link LinkedIn Share Link Copy link Email Share Link Twitter Share Link Facebook Share Link LinkedIn Share Link Media Contact Mary Huber Office of the Vice President for Research e: mary.huber@austin.utexas.edu The University of Texas at Austin Explore Latest Articles Sep 13, 2021 UT Austin Climbs in Latest National Undergraduate Rankings Read More UT Austin Climbs in Latest National Undergraduate Rankings Sep 10, 2021 We built this city.

By Kim Martineau September 09, 2021 Columbia researchers Pierre Gentine (left) and Galen McKinley will lead the new climate modeling center. (Image: Marley Bauce) This past summer was marked by intense wildfires, heat waves, flooding, and drought around the world. How much more extreme weather can we expect in the coming decades? It’s hard to say. Climate change is complex, and the farther ahead we look, the cloudier the projections get. Globally, this uncertainty has often been used as an excuse to put off expensive or unpopular measures like building seawalls, retreating inland, and upgrading or relocating electrical grids, transit systems, and other critical infrastructure. A Q&A with Columbia researchers Galen McKinley and Carl Vondrick How Next-Generation Climate Models Will Improve on What We Have Now To bring greater precision to climate modeling and encourage societies to prepare for the inevitable disruptions ahead, the National Science Foundation (NSF) has selected Columbia to lead a climate modeling center called Learning the Earth with Artificial Intelligence and Physics (LEAP). In collaboration with the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) and NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), the center will develop the next generation of data-driven physics-based climate models. It will also train a new wave of students fluent in both climate science and working with big datasets and modern machine-learning algorithms. The center’s larger goal is to provide actionable information for societies to adapt to climate change and protect the most vulnerable. “Until climate models can offer more precise projections, at the regional level where planning decisions are made, it will be difficult to make the billion-dollar investments needed to adapt,"" said Columbia President Lee C. Bollinger.  ""I can think of no better university than Columbia, with its interdisciplinary focus, to lead the way in tackling the climate prediction problem.” Wildfires in New Mexico in 2020. (Photo: USFS, National Interagency Fire Center, via Wikimedia Commons) The center will be led by Columbia Engineering, Columbia's Faculty of Arts of Sciences, and Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, in collaboration with Teachers College, Columbia Business School, the School of Social Work, and the new cross-cutting Columbia Climate School. Global climate models agree that the planet will continue to warm in the next 40 years. But they disagree on how much, and how severe the impacts will be, from sea-level rise to an increase in floods and drought. Much of the problem comes down to trying to represent the details of complex physical and biological processes—like clouds reflecting sunlight into space or trees absorbing carbon from the air—into the models. Processes interact, and many are poorly understood. With the help of big data and machine learning, researchers will dig deeper into these processes and update the models with new knowledge to improve climate projections. Researchers will harness existing algorithms to analyze satellite images and other large-scale observational data missing from today’s models. They will also develop new algorithms to take detailed observations and generalize them to broader contexts, discover cause and effect relationships in the data, and find better equations to describe the processes represented in the models. As new knowledge gets woven into the models, researchers will use machine-learning tools to test their predictions. In addition to NCAR and GISS, Columbia researchers will collaborate with peers at New York University, and universities of California at Irvine, Minnesota, and Montreal to update the NSF-funded and NCAR-based Community Earth System Model . More accurate modeling will allow researchers to gaze farther into the future, and at closer geographic range.  “Let’s say I want to know the number of heat-wave days in NYC in 2050,” said center director Pierre Gentine , a professor of earth and environmental engineering. “Some models may say 10 days. Some say 20 days.

More accurate models will help give us a clearer vision of the future.” Dealing with massive data requires a modern infrastructure. In collaboration with Google Cloud and Microsoft, Ryan Abernathey , an associate professor of earth and environmental sciences based at Lamont-Doherty, will create a platform to allow researchers to share and analyze data. To achieve its mission, the center will create a new discipline merging climate science with data science and AI. Carl Vondrick , an assistant professor of computer science, will lead the team developing new algorithms to advance the science of climate change and improve current models. Tian Zheng , a statistics professor and chair of the department, will lead a team developing undergraduate and graduate educational programs that blend climate science and data science, and classroom learning with research experience. Climate change will affect all of humanity, yet most climate science research to date has failed to draw from the full diversity of people and ideas available. To address the imbalance, the center will make diversity, equity, and inclusion central to its research and education mission. Courtney D. Cogburn , an associate professor of social work and a member of the Data Science Institute, will oversee diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives and the transfer of knowledge to communities most vulnerable to climate change. “Confronting the threat of climate change will require our brightest minds and best technologies,” said Columbia Provost Mary Boyce . “The LEAP center, with its entwined research and education mission, will play a pivotal role in getting us there.” Columbia will contribute to two other NSF Science and Technology Centers chosen for funding this year, joining Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in studying how ocean microbes impact carbon cycling and climate, and the University of Washington in developing optoelectronic materials, devices, and systems to generate, sense, and control light.

Edit Story Sep 10, 2021, 01:53am EDT | How Do We Use Artificial Intelligence Ethically? Bernard Marr Contributor Opinions expressed by Forbes Contributors are their own. Enterprise Tech Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin I’m hugely passionate about artificial intelligence (AI) , and I'm proud to say that I help companies use AI to do amazing things in the world. But we must make sure we use AI responsibly, so we can make the world a better place. In this post, I’m going to give you some tips for making sure you apply AI ethically within your organization. How Do We Use Artificial Intelligence Ethically? AdobeStock 1. Start with education and awareness about AI. Communicate clearly with people (externally and internally) about what AI can do and its challenges. It is possible to use AI for the wrong reasons, so organizations need to figure out the right purposes for using AI and how to stay within predefined ethical boundaries. Everyone across the organization needs to understand what AI is, how it can be used, and what its ethical challenges are. 2. Be transparent. This is one of the biggest things I stress with every organization I work with. Every organization needs to be open and honest (both internally and externally) about how they’re using AI. One of my clients, the Royal Bank of Scotland, wanted to use AI to improve some of the services they provide to their clients. When they began their initiative, they were (and continue to be) transparent and clear with their customers about what data they were collecting, how that data was being used, and what benefits the customers were getting from it. MORE FOR YOU It’s Time To End The SEC’s “Clarity” Charade On Crypto Digital Transformation Is Only The Beginning: A Company’s Journey The Crypto Uprising The SEC Didn’t See Coming When I look at the recent Cambridge Analytica scandal, I feel like a big part of the problem was Facebook’s lack of transparency about how they were using AI and how they were collecting and using their customers’ data. A clear AI communication policy could have solved a lot of problems before they even happened. Customers need to trust the companies they work with – and that requires full transparency about how AI fits into the company’s overall strategy and how it affects customers. 3. Control for bias. As much as possible, organizations need to make sure the data they're using is not biased. For instance, Google created a huge database of facial images called ImageNet. Their data set included far more white faces than non-white faces, so when they trained AIs to use this data, they worked better on white faces than non-white ones. Creating better data sets and better algorithms is not just an opportunity to use AI ethically – it’s also a way to try to address some racial and gender biases in the world on a larger scale. 4. Make it explainable. Can your artificial intelligence algorithms be explained? When we use modern AI tools like deep learning, they can be “black boxes” where humans don’t really understand the decision-making processes within their algorithms. Companies feed them data, the AIs learn from that data, and then they make a decision. But if you use deep learning algorithms to determine who should get healthcare treatment and who doesn't, or who should be allowed to go on parole and who shouldn’t, these are massively big decisions with huge implications for individual lives. It is increasingly important for organizations to understand exactly how the AI makes decisions and be able to explain those systems. A lot of work has recently gone into the development of explainable AIs. We now have ways to better explain even the most complicated deep learning systems, so there’s no excuse for having a continued air of confusion or mystery around your algorithms. 5. Make it inclusive. At the moment, we have far too many male, white people working on AI. We need to make sure the people building the AI systems of the future are as diverse as our world. There is some progress in bringing in more women and people of color (POC) to make sure the AI you’re building truly represents our society as a whole, but that has to go far further. 6. Follow the rules. Of course, when it comes to the use of AI, we must adhere to regulation. We are seeing increasing regulation of AI in Europe and in parts of the US. However, there’s still a lot of unregulated parts that rely on self-regulation by organizations. Companies like Google and Microsoft are focusing on using AI for good, and Google has its own self-defined AI principles. When I work with organizations, we often put together an ethics council for AI that acts as the North Star for AI ethics concerns for that company. Whenever an organization identifies a use case for AI, the ethics council evaluates it for ethical concerns. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), was founded in 1961 to stimulate economic progress, and it includes 37 member countries. The organization created the OECD AI principles, which are a great starting point for thinking about how your organization can use AI in ways that benefit people and the planet. Then AI should be designed in a way that respects laws, human rights, democratic values, and diversity. AI must function in a robust, secure, and safe way, with risks being continuously assessed and managed. Organizations developing AI should be held accountable for the proper functioning of these systems in line with these principles. The 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations can also be a great resource for you as you’re establishing your AI use cases . If the way you're using AI aligns with OECD principles and the UN Sustainable Development Goals, you're probably well on your way to ensuring that you're using AI ethically.

U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said in a press release on Thursday (Sept. 9) that “top-level candidates” are currently being sought to serve on the National Artificial Intelligence Advisory Committee (NAIAC). See also: LUMO Labs Backs Autoscriber to Advance Healthcare AI Voice Recognition “AI presents an enormous opportunity to tackle the biggest issues of our time, strengthen our technological competitiveness and be an engine for growth in nearly every sector of the economy,” said Raimondo. “But we must be thoughtful, creative and wise in how we address the challenges that accompany these new technologies. That includes, but is not limited to, ensuring that President Biden’s comprehensive commitment to advancing equity and racial justice extends to our development and use of AI technology. This committee will help the federal government do that by providing insights into a full range of issues raised by AI.” Related news: Walmart Partners With Meredith for AI-Informed Contextual Grocery Commerce The formation of the committee comes the National AI Initiative Act of 2020, which called on the Secretary of Commerce to establish the NAIAC in conjunction with the OSTP director and other federal agencies — the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of State and the Attorney General. “We have seen major advances in the design, development and use of AI, especially in the past several years,” said Eric Lander, White House science advisor and OSTP director. “We must be sure that these advances are matched by similar progress in ensuring that AI is trustworthy and that it ensures fairness and protections for civil rights.” You may also enjoy: Mastercard Buys Crypto Intel Startup CipherTrace Experts from an extensive range of AI domains are being recruited to comprise the NAIAC, including accomplished leaders from “across academia, industry, nonprofits and civil society, and federal laboratories,” according to the release.

This article was written by Bob Friday, Vice President and Chief Technology Officer of Juniper’s AI-Driven Enterprise Business. In a recent survey of 700 IT pros around the world, 95% said they believe their companies would benefit from embedding artificial intelligence (AI) into daily operations, products, and services, and 88% want to use AI as much as possible. When was the last time you heard that many people agree on anything? Yes, AI is all the rage because it is the next step in the evolution of automation in doing tasks on par with human domain experts whether it is driving a car or helping doctors diagnose disease. But make no mistake while we are starting to see the fruits of AI here and there: By and large, the industry and most organizations are still in the early days of AI adoption. And as with any new momentous technology, organizations need to develop an adoption strategy specific to their organization to get the full benefits of AI automation and deep learning technology. The complication as Gartner put it : “How to make AI a core IT competency still eludes most organizations.” But failing to learn how to leverage the benefits AI/ML will leave an organization at a competitive disadvantage in terms of customer experience and operational efficiency. So, what’s the way to get there? Here are three common traps that companies should steer clear of as they get themselves AI-ready. 1. Data and Mission vagueness Great wine requires good grapes and great AI starts with good data, but great AI also needs a clear business ROI. The business benefit ROI and the data needed to automate the domain expert task must be clearly defined at the outset of the project if the AI solution is to deliver real value and continue receiving the resources to grow from pilot to production. AI ingredients, like algorithms and machine learning, sound very science-y, but business AI projects should never resemble science experiments. The “Shiny New Toy Syndrome” is a real pitfall for AI. To avoid succumbing to it, organizations should tie every AI project to specific business outcomes and know the business outcome question and what task you are trying to do on par with a domain expert. For example, is the objective of using intelligent automation to relieve IT team members of mundane, routine tasks so they can focus on higher-value activities? Beyond the IT department, is it to help the marketing department gain competitive advantage by delivering more personalized experiences to customers? Is it automating more of the sales process to boost lead volume and close rate? C-suite leaders would have to be living under a rock at this point not to recognize AI’s potential and the fact that investment is required for AI-ready technology stacks, but they’re going to want to understand how it’s good for the business. Everyone in a company needs to recognize this reality, and ward off any squishiness in an AI project’s reason for being. 2. Lack of AI/ML skills in the company The AI talent shortage is often cited as one of the tech industry’s toughest challenges. It has even been called a national security threat amid China’s ambitions to become the world leader in AI. According to O’Reilly’s 2021 AI Adoption in the Enterprise report , which surveyed more than 3,500 business leaders, a lack of skilled people and difficulty hiring tops the list of AI challenges. To make sure their companies have the talent to fully leverage the benefits of AI/ML they should start both a hiring and training program. On the hiring side, companies should look for talent beyond the typical data science degree and look at adjacent degrees such as physics, math and self-taught computer science. But hiring talent is not enough for a companies’ strategy to build their AI workforces, especially when they’re competing with behemoths like Amazon and Facebook. Another good solution to consider: If you can’t hire them, train them. While it’s unreasonable to expect someone to become a data scientist after taking a couple of online Coursera classes. Engineers with Physics, Math and Computer Science backgrounds have the foundation to master data science and deep learning. Sources of talent may exist inside the organization in unexpected places. Take, for example, the large business intelligence (BI) ecosystems that many companies have. These have talent that is familiar with using Bayesian statistical analysis that is common to most machine learning algorithms. In making sure they have the right skills to support AI initiatives, it makes sense for companies to re-train existing employees as much as possible in addition to having an AI/ML hiring strategy. Companies need to get creative in pinpointing those employees and AI/ML talent. 3. Building rather than buying I’ve seen companies get bogged down by trying to build their own AI tools and solutions from scratch rather than buying them or leveraging open source. The algorithms being used to develop AI solutions are fast evolving and companies should look to partner with vendors in their industry who are leading the AI wave. Unless it happens to be one of the company’s core competencies, building AI solutions is usually an overreach. Why reinvent the wheel when you can buy one of the many commercial AI tools on the market? Deloitte’s most recent State of the AI in the Enterprise report , which surveyed 2,737 IT and line-of-business executives worldwide, found that “seasoned” and “skilled” AI adopters are more likely than “starters” to buy the AI systems they need. “This suggests that many organizations may go through a period of internal learning and experimentation before they know what’s necessary and then seek it from the market,” the report said. Companies that avoid these three traps will have a much easier time accelerating their AI adoption and enjoying the benefits of revenue growth, lower operating costs, and improved customer experience.

Data is the new oil and therefore, as a consequence data scientist is the most in-demand career in the market right now. The demand for data science abilities will rise as the sector matures with new-age technology and solutions. Businesses of all sizes are eager to use data to improve efficiencies, and as a result, they are always looking to hire someone who can collect, evaluate, and analyse data. Nevertheless, the supply does not meet the industry’s needs. The rise in demand can be attributed to the introduction of big data and the way data is generated and used by businesses today. Businesses will need data science personnel with specialised abilities to collect and analyse this massive amount of data. At the same time, organisations are constantly looking for ways to improve their customer experience through predictive analytics, and data scientists can help businesses understand their data and utilise it to forecast customer behaviour. However, there are certain unique reasons why data science professionals are in such short supply. Data Science- Scope: The discipline of data science is growing at an unprecedented rate, producing a great demand for talent in a variety of fields. Apart from the rapid growth of startups, many large firms and businesses have begun to incorporate data science into their heritage ecosystems in order to increase efficiency and revenues. There is a huge demand for skilled data scientists all around the world, especially in countries like India, which is quickly developing. In India, there is a vast array of data-related enterprises. Data science, data analytics, big data engineers, big data managers, and data architects are the most common employment options. To address these gaps, personnel must be well-versed in a variety of data-related technologies. While a one-month crash course in data science can be a wonderful place to start, if you want to pursue a career in the field, you must have a thorough understanding of the subject. Lack of Skill The learning curve for data science is quite steep. You need to master the underlying math, statistics, and computer science to be a full-fledged data scientist, not simply the Tensorflow or Keras syntax. Despite the fact that there is an influx of data scientists every year, there are very few people who have the necessary knowledge in the field. Most data scientists have formal degrees in computer science, statistics, or mathematics, which is unusual in a world of self-taught coders. In terms of institutions and boot camps offering degrees in data science, India is still lagging behind the United States. As a result, just a few people are informed about data science. More businesses are utilising data Because all firms nowadays are utilising the value of big data in order to make informed business decisions, one of the key reasons for the lack of data scientists in the industry is that all companies are exploiting the value of big data. The growing demand for analytics in businesses has resulted in a severe shortage of data scientists. Despite the fact that many people want to work in data science, there isn’t enough trained labour to fill the positions. The quantity of STEM graduates each year does not keep pace with the industry’s demand for data scientists. Small firms can get by with one software engineer and an analyst who can analyse data, but a large corporation will need a team of data professionals that includes not just programmers and engineers, but also data visualisation specialists and project coordinators. As a result the company’s existing data scientists are under increasing pressure to complete more projects and solve more business challenges. It is therefore critical for data science aficionados to enrol in data science boot camps, complete projects, and seek out additional resources in order to get the essential expertise to close the skill gap.

Database What is Apache Hadoop? Understanding Hadoop Ecosystem & Architecture By Surajdeep Singh September 9, 2021 Share Facebook Twitter Linkedin Email Print Data science is an interdisciplinary sphere of study that has gained traction over the years, given the sheer amount of data we produce on a daily basis — projected to be over 2.5 quintillion bytes of data. The field of study utilizes modern techniques and tools to extract useful information, find undiscovered patterns and make business resolutions from structured and unstructured data. As data science utilizes both structured and unstructured data, the data used for analysis can be obtained from an array of application domains and available in multiple formats. Data science tools are used to construct predictive models and generate meaningful information by extracting, processing, and analyzing structured and unstructured data. The primary goal of implementing data science software is to clean up and standardize data by uniting machine learning (ML), data analysis, statistics, and business intelligence (BI). With data science tools and techniques, you can easily determine the main cause of a problem by addressing the right questions, explore and study data, model various forms of data using algorithms and visualize and communicate results via graphs, dashboards, etc. Data science software like Apache Hadoop comes with pre-defined functions, a suite of tools and libraries. Apache Hadoop is one of the few data science tools you should have in your kit. What is Hadoop? Apache Hadoop is an open source software designed for reliable, distributed and scalable computing. The Hadoop software library is designed to scale to thousands of servers, each of which offers local computation and storage. Using simple programming models, you can process large sets of data across computer clusters in a distributed manner. The software solves complex computational tasks and data-intensive problems by dissecting large sets of data into chunks and sending them to computers with instructions. The Hadoop library does not depend on hardware resources to deliver high availability; all failures are detected and rectified at the application layer. Understanding the Apache Hadoop Ecosystem The Hadoop ecosystem consists of the following major components: HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) – HDFS is the backbone of the Hadoop ecosystem that is responsible for storing large sets of structured, semi-structured and unstructured data. With HDFS, you can store data across various nodes and maintain metadata. HDFS has two core components, NameNode and DataNode. A NameNode executes operations like opening, closing and changing the names of files and directories and the mapping of blocks to DataNodes. DataNodes on the other hand serve read and write requests from clients and perform block creation, deletion and replication upon instruction. YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) – YARN performs all processing activities by scheduling tasks and allocating resources and is essentially the brain of the Hadoop ecosystem. It consists of two primary components, ResourceManager and NodeManager. Resource Manager processes requests, divides large tasks into smaller tasks, and assigns these tasks to NodeManagers. NodeManagers are responsible for the execution of tasks on DataNodes. MapReduce – MapReduce is the primary component of processing in the Hadoop ecosystem, based on the YARN framework. It contains two main functions, Map() and Reduce (). Map() performs functions like sorting, grouping and filtering on data received as input to produce Tuples (key-value pairs). Reduce () aggregates and summarizes the Tuples produced by Map(). Apache PIG and Apache HIVE – Apache PIG works on the Pig Latin language, a query-based language that is similar to SQL. PIG is a platform for data structuring, processing and analyzing. Apache HIVE uses an SQL-like query language called HQL to read, write and manage large sets of data in a distributed environment. Apache Spark – Apache Spark is a framework written in Scala that handles all process consumptive jobs like iterative or interactive real-time processing, batch processing, visualization and graph conversions. Apache Mahout – Apache Mahout offers an environment for creating scalable ML applications. Its functions include frequent item set missing checks, classification, clustering and collaborative filtering. Apache HBase – Apache HBase is an open source NoSQL database that supports all types of data and is modeled after Google’s BigTable, thereby enabling effective handling of Big Data data sets. Hadoop Common – Hadoop Common provides standard libraries and functions that support Hadoop ecosystem modules. Other components of the Hadoop ecosystem include Apache Drill, Apache Zookeeper, Apache Oozie, Apache Flume, Apache Sqoop, Apache Ambari and Apache Hadoop Ozone. Understanding Apache Hadoop Architecture The Apache Hadoop framework consists of three major components: HDFS – HDFS follows a master/slave architecture. Each HDFS cluster has a solitary NameNode that serves as a master server and a number of serving DataNodes (usually one per node in the cluster). YARN – YARN performs job scheduling and resource management. ResourceManager receives jobs, divides jobs into smaller jobs and assigns these jobs to various slaves (DataNodes) in a Hadoop cluster. These slaves are managed by NodeManagers. NodeManagers ensure the execution of jobs on DataNodes. MapReduce – MapReduce works on the YARN framework and performs distributed processing in parallel in a Hadoop cluster. Using Apache Hadoop Apache Hadoop is a must-have data science tool. It offers all the provisions you need to process large sets of data. You can avail of the software for free and use its capabilities to create a tailored solution for your enterprise. Explore the Hadoop ecosystem in detail and learn about each of its components to build a solution of promise.

By Kim Martineau September 09, 2021 Columbia climate scientist Galen McKinley (left) and computer scientist Carl Vondrick Read More Columbia to Launch $25 Million AI-based Climate Modeling Center With funding from the National Science Foundation, Columbia is set to launch a new research center aimed at building the next generation of data-driven physics-based climate models. Current models agree that Earth will get warmer in the next few decades, but they disagree on how severe the effects will be, and what parts of the world will be hardest hit. With collaborators at other universities and national labs, Columbia researchers will update the models with new information gleaned from massive datasets and new machine-learning methods. The broader goal of the center, called Learning the Earth with AI and Physics, is to provide actionable information for societies to adapt to climate change and protect the most vulnerable. Columbia News caught up with the center’s deputy director, Galen McKinley, and its data science director, Carl Vondrick, to dig into the details. Q: How do global climate models currently work? What are their limitations? GALEN MCKINLEY: Climate models, also known as earth system models, work by representing the physics, chemistry, and biology of the climate system as mathematical equations. These equations are solved on a three-dimensional grid with cells representing the atmosphere, land, and ocean. We have no data for the future, and so the models draw from the scientific knowledge embedded in the equations to make their projections. Historical data are used to validate model simulations for the recent past, but are not directly used to guide the model. Most earth system models run on supercomputers, but they require even more computing power than we have available. This limits the size of the cells in our three-dimensional grid. In current models, a cell typically measures 60 miles on each side, with one value per cell representing a single variable like temperature, cloud cover, or rainfall. But, in the real world, these properties vary significantly over an area covering about 360 square miles! Researchers will improve on current climate models by using big data and machine learning to better represent small-scale processes, like cloud cover, and how they influence the climate system. Current models divide Earth into cells to project changes into the future; here’s what a cell representing the atmosphere might look like when greater detail is added through next-generation AI methods. (Image: Columbia University) A second limitation is that we don’t know how to write accurate equations for all the physical, chemical, and biological processes that influence climate. The equations we have are often based on field experiments from a few locations or points in time, and thus do not represent all conditions equally well. We tend to know physical equations better than biological equations, and research is ongoing to improve them. But we still have much to learn. Q: What existing machine-learning algorithms will you apply to the models to improve projections? CARL VONDRICK: The form of machine learning we are using, deep learning, achieves excellent performance when we have large amounts of data. The center will capitalize on this technology to better represent several climate processes like ocean turbulence or ice sheet flow in the models. One technique we’re particularly excited about is generative adversarial networks, or GANs, which will allow us to fill in data gaps with a high level of detail. We’re also excited to leverage techniques for equation discovery, allowing us to interpret the neural networks that underlie deep-learning algorithms to extract equations that may advance our understanding of Earth’s climate system. Q: You'll also be developing new algorithms. What questions will these AI tools address? CV: A key aim of the center is to deliver next-generation machine-learning technology for answering some of the unresolved questions in climate science. We’ve seen many exciting advances in AI lately, but there are still key obstacles to overcome. For example, current algorithms excel at identifying patterns in data, but they often make projections that violate basic laws of physics. Further, large datasets provide the best results, but for many physical and biological processes, collecting this much data is either impractical or too expensive. To solve these challenges, LEAP researchers will investigate how to deeply embed physical knowledge into state-of-the-art machine-learning models, thereby allowing systems to identify causal relationships, make do with less data, and reliably generalize to new situations. Q: Deep-learning algorithms can find patterns and correlations in big datasets but can't tease out cause and effect relationships. How would algorithms equipped with causal reasoning help to improve climate models? CV: Cause-and-effect reasoning is crucial for the models to capture why different physical and biological events happen. For a simple example, standard machine-learning methods tell us whether clouds and rain are related, but not much more. Machine learning with causal reasoning will tell us whether the clouds actually created the rain, and whether more clouds will create more rain. Embedding causality into the models will be pivotal for planning adaptation strategies to different climate processes. Q: Humanity is also unpredictable. It's unclear how much national economies will grow, and how much more greenhouse gases we'll pump into the air. The transition to clean energy could off-set some of our growth-related emission increases. How much does this uncertainty affect climate projections? GM: There is no doubt that our emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are driving climate change. The most important action we can take is to cut emissions as rapidly as possible. But carbon dioxide stays in the air for a long time, and thus any changes we make today to reduce emissions or remake our energy infrastructure won’t have much of an impact until at least 2050. In the meantime, we must adapt to the warming set in motion by current and future emissions. Our center is focused on making climate projections that can help guide the difficult decisions that will need to be made in the next few decades regarding climate adaptation. Right now, we’re focused on uncertainties in the models.

""To penetrate the global market we need to collaborate with international partners and this relationship with Microsoft presents the opportunity to do that,"" he says. Nicholas Moretti, Azure Space Engineer, Microsoft Australia adds, ""I first got exposed to the space industry while I was studying for my undergraduate degree at the University of Adelaide and crossed paths with Professor Chin. ""We are delighted to be working with AIML and believe this will help identify important opportunities to use these technologies and capabilities to support agriculture and ecology, economics and financial systems as well as the burgeoning space sector itself,"" he says. Although focused on in-space technologies, Project AI Off Earth will explore how space related technologies and data, and cognitive systems can be used to support automation of multiple different industries, help establish smart cities, as well as address sustainability and important environment challenges. AIML and Microsoft are already collaborating using Microsoft Azure Orbital Emulator a cloud-based native space emulation environment that enables massive satellite constellation simulations. Using Azure Orbital Emulator, AIML and Project AI Off Earth can quickly develop, evaluate, and train algorithms, machine learning models and AI intended for space without need to launch a single satellite. ""The University of Adelaide undertakes world-leading research in the space sector, as well as many other fields, which aims to find solutions to the challenges facing society,"" says the University of Adelaide's Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Research) Professor Anton Middelberg. ""This exciting new relationship between the Australian Institute for Machine Learning and Microsoft will help AIMLs expertise to have an impact on a truly global scale."" The collaboration comes at a time of soaring interest in the space-related economy; the Australian Space Agency's goal is to triple the space sectors contribution to GDP to $12 billion and create an additional 20,000 jobs by 2030. South Australian Minister for Trade and Investment, Stephen Patterson adds, ""Adelaide has established itself as the very heart of Australias space industry. ""This agreement between AIML and Microsoft, which is building a space team, is a signal of whats to come. Australia has the opportunity to be a leading player in the global space industry and this sort of international collaboration centred on Adelaide but with a truly global focus will strengthen the local industry, help build skills in this important area and reinforce Adelaides reputation as the epicentre of space activity in this part of the world,"" he says. AIML and Microsoft Azure Space also intend to use Project AI Off Earth to advocate for STEM careers, to advise on structuring of STEM traineeships and scholarships, and to encourage greater participation by women, underprivileged groups, and underrepresented groups.

Previously, he served as the executive director of Youth Will and as a trustee for the San Diego Community College District. Atkins said Elo-Rivera was a natural fit for the governing board given his expertise and long-time commitment to working with students. “A trusted community leader and youth advocate, Councilmember Sean Elo-Rivera has dedicated his life’s work to youth development and empowerment,” she said. “As the governing board develops and implements the Cradle-to-Career Data System, Councilmember Elo-Rivera’s experience as a San Diego Community College District Board Trustee will be an essential resource for ensuring the database is a source for actionable data and research that will help guide decisions and provide future generations with the tools they need for success.” Along with Elo-Rivera, Atkins appointed Sen. John Laird, D-Santa Cruz, and Dr. Meredith Lee — who currently serves as chief technical advisor for computing, data science, and society at University of California, Berkeley. The Senate’s two public members will serve an initial two-year term on the Cradle-to-Career governing board and receive per diem and reimbursement for travel. –City News Service Support Times of San Diego With the generous support of readers like you, Times of San Diego publishes timely and accurate news coverage for a better-informed community.

The buildings will be terraced into the hillside between Prospect Avenue and Ivy Lane. This architect’s rendering shows the west entrance of the proposed complex. Image courtesy of Ennead Architects LLP/bloomimages From addressing climate change to developing new ways of delivering vaccines , Princeton’s proposed engineering and environmental studies project will enable breakthrough teaching and research in the service of humanity while enhancing the public experience of the surrounding neighborhood. The University plans to build a new home for Environmental Studies (ES) and the School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS) between Ivy Lane and Prospect Avenue. The four buildings — environmental science, bioengineering, chemical and biological engineering, and an engineering commons — will create a new ES + SEAS neighborhood carefully integrated into the surrounding landscape with strong connections to outdoor spaces. The buildings will include state-of-the-art teaching, research and collaboration facilities for seven academic departments, institutes and centers. The four buildings — environmental science, bioengineering, chemical and biological engineering, and an engineering commons — will create a new ES + SEAS neighborhood carefully integrated into the surrounding landscape with strong connections to outdoor spaces. This rendering shows an aerial view of the proposed buildings, which will create a neighborhood that more closely connects engineering and environmental studies with the rest of campus to foster collaboration with the natural sciences, humanities, public policy and other disciplines. Image courtesy of Ennead Architects LLP/bloomimages SEAS Dean Andrea Goldsmith said the new facilities are essential to conducting research that has tremendous benefits to human health and society — including work addressing climate change and carbon sequestration, new pharmaceuticals and vaccines, better processes for the production of new materials, and greater energy efficiency. The new buildings also will further environmental science studies that are crucial to learning about and mitigating global challenges related to biodiversity, conservation, climate, energy, and environmental policy. “We are at a point where the current facilities for engineering are 60 years old. They are no longer sufficient to do the groundbreaking research that we want to accomplish,” said Goldsmith, the Arthur LeGrand Doty Professor of Electrical Engineering. “The reason that Princeton Engineering needs to grow is that engineering has changed. In the last decades, engineering has become much more interdisciplinary. It is solving much more complex problems that require a broader set of expertise, of disciplinary and interdisciplinary expertise.” Goldsmith said that the neighborhood’s central location is critical to convene expertise across the sciences, humanities and public policy. “All the richness of ideas we need to solve the problems we face. This project is really about maximizing our impact and delivering on Princeton's motto to benefit humanity, through engineering and technology,"" she added. The project reflects the importance of environmental studies and engineering in a 21st century liberal arts university. The buildings will create a neighborhood that more closely connects engineering and environmental studies with the rest of the University’s campus, including the new home for the Department of Computer Science . The proximity of key collaborators in different departments also amplifies connections between the growing fields of bioengineering, data science and environmental research and creates a center of gravity for convening diverse experts and innovators across and beyond the University to address critical societal needs. “It is really designed around connectivity,"" said University Architect Ronald McCoy. The new buildings, all connected underground in one continuous sequence, will maintain distinct identities for disciplines while allowing for strong connections among them. “When we spoke to the faculty they were really clear: 'We need better space and we need more of it.' These are state-of-the-art, flexible, and highly functional teaching and research spaces,” McCoy said. Athanassios (Thanos) Panagiotopoulos, chair of the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, said the new teaching, research, lab and collaboration spaces are “absolutely critical to the mission of the University to serve society by addressing urgent needs.” “Our department’s work is about mitigating climate change, creating new chemical processes that will allow us to replace fossil fuels with renewables, and giving us the tools to address public health and wellbeing,” said Panagiotopoulos, the Susan Dod Brown Professor of Chemical and Biological Engineering. “The technologies that enable the Covid vaccines to become quickly, widely and safely available -- the ability to protect those tiny mRNA packages – uses technology that chemical engineers have developed.” The ES + SEAS project is also a model of the University’s sustainability ethos. The complex meets or exceeds Princeton sustainability standards and will seek LEED certification. It will feature geo-exchange heating and cooling, a green roof, high performance exteriors, rainwater harvesting and sustainable materials. The design also reflects the University’s strong commitment to being a steward of buildings and landscapes while pursuing critical opportunities for innovation, creativity and benefit to society. The buildings will be terraced into the hillside between Prospect Avenue and Ivy Lane currently occupied by faculty and staff housing and parking lots behind eating club buildings. As part of the project’s careful, thoughtful planning and design process, the University is planning to relocate the Office of the Dean for Research building at 91 Prospect Avenue to across the street, allowing for it to remain part of a vibrant Prospect Avenue. The neighborhood will include sunken courtyards and extensive pedestrian paths and outdoor spaces for the public and community. The complex also includes public display spaces for interaction with school groups and the community, as well as lecture halls for public outreach and engagement. This architect’s rendering shows the Prospect Avenue entry of the proposed ES + SEAS neighborhood. The ES + SEAS project is also a model of the University’s sustainability ethos and sustainable building standards.

Log In All Posts Research Results Data Sets Applications and Modeling Tools Commentaries and Articles Search Jeffrey Morris 4 days ago 20 min read What do new Israeli data say about effect of vaccines & boosters vs. death/critical/severe disease? Updated: 9 hours ago Key Points: I downloaded and analyzed data containing daily COVID-19 deaths and critical infection numbers from the Israeli ministry of health dashboard from August 10 and September 8, overall and split out by <60yr and >60yr, to assess effectiveness of boosters and vaccination without boosters relative to unvaccinated. Because of age confounding, it is crucial to stratify by age groups, and further to remove children from the <60yr group; otherwise Simpson's paradox makes vaccines look like they are not effective in protecting against COVID-19 deaths at all. After doing this adjustment, we see the vaccines and boosters are strongly protecting against both COVID-19 deaths and critical infections. For the >60 population, we see ~70% effectiveness for vaccinated, which increases to >93% for boosted, agreeing with other public reports showing boosters reducing serious cases in the older population. For the 12yr-60yr population, we see ~90% effectiveness for vaccinated, whether boosted or not. However, there may still be a remaining ""Simpson's effect"" attenuating the estimated effectiveness of boosters in the 12yr-60yr group, since most boosted are in the 40-60yr group that has higher risk of death and critical disease, so the effectiveness of boosters might in fact be >>90%. One limitation of these data are that the Israeli MoH did not separate out previously infected.  These may comprise a substantial proportion of unvaccinated, especially in the older groups, which may lead to additional attenuation of effectiveness estimates. Overall, these data agree with what we have seen in all careful analyses of vaccine data: that even with Delta and with some waning immune protection after some time, the vaccines are still strongly protecting against severe, critical, and fatal disease. Boosters provide further protection but it is not yet clear whether they are necessary for the younger age groups. In a previous blog post , I highlighted two key quantitative points that often confuse people when looking at COVID-19 data for vaccinated and unvaccinated populations: It is meaningless to consider ""percent of cases/hospitalizations/deaths"" that are vaccinated without accounting for what percentage of the population is vaccinated.  This can easily be done by normalizing the counts of cases/hospitalizations/deaths based on the overall number vaccinated or not in the population, but many fail to make this basic adjustment. With observational data, the failure to account for confounding factors that are associated with both exposure (vaccination status) and outcome (cases/hospitalizations/deaths) can produce misleading results, sometimes dramatically misleading if the confounding is strong enough.  In the previous post, ""age"" was the confounding factor. ""full vaccination"" the exposure, and ""severe disease"" the outcome, with older people much more likely both to be vaccinated as well as to have severe disease, causing the paradoxical result of vaccine effectiveness appearing much lower when computed overall (67.5%) than when computed separately by age groups (91.8% for <50yr, 85.2% for >50yr), illustrating a statistical artifact known as Simpson's Paradox . The data analyzed in that post were downloaded from Israel's Ministry of Health (MoH) dashboard and comprised of all ""currently active serious COVID-19 cases"" as of August 15, 2021.  These data provided a snapshot of active serious cases at that time, and the analysis involved an assessment of how the rates differed among vaccinated or unvaccinated.  The dashboard did not contain information on COVID-19 deaths or critical cases, it did not contain data over a longer period of time, and  it did not contain information on 3rd shot boosters that had just started being distributed on August 1. This 3rd shot booster program, initially limited to immunocompromised and older residents, has now been made available to all adult Israeli residents, and in fact an Israeli resident whose second shot was >5 months ago is not considered ""fully vaccinated"" unless they have received the 3rd shot booster . Recently, the MoH has updated the dashboard to include daily counts of deaths, new serious cases, and new critical cases, on September 9 sharing data containing daily counts from August 10, 2021 through September 8, 2021 split out by boosted , vaccinated but not boosted , and unvaccinated. These data contain both raw counts and normalized ""counts per 100k"" from which the denominators (total population boosted, vaccinated, or unvaccinated) can be inferred, plus they report both overall counts as well as split out by age group (<60, >60).   Because they contain data over a fixed time period, these data enable estimation of effectiveness of vaccine and/or booster summarizing difference in rates for unvaccinated and vaccinated for that period of time, rather than for just a snapshot of currently active cases like the previous analysis, plus enables evaluation of difference in rates for those boosted vs. those fully vaccinated but not yet boosted.   I have downloaded and collated these data together to assess what they can tell us about vaccine effectiveness (VE) vs. deaths, critical cases, or severe cases of COVID-19 for boosters, as well as for vaccination without boosters.  The links to the data sets and transparent explanations for my calculations are provided at the end of this article. As we will see, the same tricky quantitative nuances highlighted in the previous post are evident here for all three outcomes, so once again this post serves as a warning to be careful not to misinterpret simple summaries of the data, and to be sure to stratify by age to avoid the Simpson's paradox effect caused by strong age confounding that also is present for these outcomes. Warning : the initial tables make it appear that the vaccines and boosters are ""not working"" at preventing COVID-19 deaths, but please be sure to see the later tables that show once age is accounted for reasonably well the vaccines and boosters seem to be doing well in reducing risk of COVID-19 death. Also, I must start with a disclaimer: While the following analysis is legitimate and the best I can do with the publicly available data on the MoH dashboard, I do not consider this to be a state-of-the-art analysis that is the end-all indicator of VE vs. death, critical disease, or severe disease in Israel, or effects of boosters.  There are other important confounders other than age that should be accounted for but were not available in this data set, there are some questions about how previously infected or partially vaccinated were handled in this data set that may require additional adjustment, plus there is uncertainty about whether the recorded dates are date of event (death, hospitalization, ICU entry) or date of positive PCR test that shades precise interpretation.  Someone with access to more complete data could do a much more complete and careful analysis with more advanced modeling, as has been done in excellent papers by various research groups inside of Israel.  In spite of these limitations, I think this analysis has value not just for further illustrating how statistical nuances can distort proper interpretation of these types of data, but also in providing some information about how the vaccines and boosters appear to be impacting advanced outcomes like severe disease, critical disease, and deaths. Effectiveness of Vaccination and Boosters against COVID-19 Deaths I will start by focusing on the COVID-19 death data, to assess the estimated effectiveness of the booster and of vaccination without booster in preventing COVID-19 deaths relative to the unvaccinated group during this period of time. Following are the total COVID-19 deaths for unvaccinated ( Not Vax ), Boosted ( Boost , meaning they have received a 3rd shot booster), and vaccinated but not boosted ( Vax (NB) ) combining the counts from August 10 through September 8. We see a total of 667 COVID-19 deaths during that time period, with only 41.5% (277) in the unvaccinated group, 12.5% in the boosted group, and 46.0% in the vaccinated but not boosted group.  Thus, we see ~60% of COVID-19 deaths were at least fully vaccinated.  These raw proportions do not paint a promising picture for the effectiveness of vaccines or boosters, but we know better than to interpret these raw numbers alone without accounting for proportion vaccinated and boosted, right?  The MoH data set does not explicitly contain total number boosted, unvaccinated, or vaccinated but not boosted, but for various outcomes they include both raw numbers as well as normalized numbers per 100k population from which these raw numbers can be inferred as detailed at the end of this article.  Since these numbers change every day as more people are vaccinated or boosted, for simplicity in this table we include the average numbers in each category over the period of August 10 through September 8: We can see that looking across the entire Israeli population, during this time period we have an average of 62% vaccinated, with 13.2% already given 3rd shot booster and 48.8% being fully vaccinated but not yet receiving 3rd shot booster. Given these total number boosted, unvaccinated, and vaccinated but not yet boosted, we can normalize the number of deaths in each group based on number per 100k population. For example, we have 83 deaths in the boosted group from a population of 1,200,310 boosted, which means that in the time period of August 10 through September 8, the proportion of boosted who died of COVID-19 is 83/1,200,310   =  0.0000691. As these small numbers are hard to interpret, we can multiply this rate times 100,000 by shifting the decimal place 5 places to get B = ""rate of COVID-19 deaths per 100k among boosted."" as 6.91, meaning that from August 10 through September 8, 6.91 out of every 100k boosted died of COVID-19. We can do the same for N = ""rate of COVID-19 deaths per 100k among unvaccinated"" and V = ""rate of COVID=19 deaths per 100k among vaccinated but not boosted"" B = 83/1,200,310 x 100,000 = 6.91 per 100k V = 307/4,446,814 x 100,000 = 6.90 per 100k N = 277/3,456,060 x 100,000 = 8.01 per 100k. Note that these numbers are proportion of the respective populations who die from a COVID-19 infection, not proportion of those with COVID-19 infection who die.  The latter proportion is called the case fatality rate , which would be an interesting number to look at as well, but a number we can't estimate here without counts of confirmed COVID-19 cases in these groups and to be more precise, matching of cases and deaths. Based on these normalized rates, we can compute vaccine effectiveness vs. COVID-19 death for boosted and for vaccinated (not boosted) relative to the unvaccinated for this time period: VE_death for boosters: 	1 - B / N =  1 - 6.91/8.01  = 13.7% VE_death for Vax (NB): 	1 - V / N =  1 - 6.90/8.01  = 13.7% Ugh.  This does not look good.  A 13.7% effectiveness vs. COVID-19 deaths would suggest that the boosters (or vaccines without boosters) are only preventing 13.7% of the COVID-19 deaths that would have occurred without vaccination or boosters.  If this reflected reality, this would be truly alarming as it would suggest that neither the vaccines nor even the boosters are substantially reducing the risk of death by COVID-19. However, please don't stop reading here and go away convinced the ""vaccines don't work"" Just as it was for severe disease in our previous analysis, age is a major confounding factor here: Older people are much more likely to be boosted (or vaccinated but not boosted) than younger people. Older people are inherently much more likely to die if they get COVID-19 than younger people. In fact, one would expect age to be an even stronger confounder here, since the disparate risk of death between young and old is even greater for deaths than severe disease, and the disparity in rates of boosters between young and old are even greater at this point in time than the rates of vaccination.  Could it be that these overall effectiveness numbers are distorted by a Simpson's paradox effect involving age once again?  Fortunately the MoH data is split out by age (they use 60 as cutpoint so we have  the data split out by <60 and >60).  Here are the counts and normalized counts for boosters and vaccination without boosters split out by the two age groups: We can see the vast majority of deaths are from the >60 group, with 254/277=91.6% of unvaccinated deaths, 82/83=98.8% of boosted deaths, and 298/307=97.1% of vaccinated (no booster) deaths in those >60yr. Here, the the normalized rates of COVID-19 deaths per 100k in the unvaccinated group is >230x higher in the >60 than <60 group, clearly showing the risk of death from COVID-19 is MUCH higher for older than that is for younger people (which we already knew, of course).  From these numbers, we can compute age-specific effectiveness estimates for boosters and vaccination (no booster). Note that the vaccine effectiveness numbers split out by age are much higher than the overall numbers without age stratification, suggesting once again a strong Simpson's effect. These results suggest that for both the younger and older age groups, >2/3 of COVID-19 deaths that would have occurred sans vaccination were prevented by full vaccination even without boosters. For the >60yr, this protection appears to be substantially stronger in the older group, with an estimated  5.2-fold reduction { (1-0.68)/(1-0.938) } = 5.2 } in risk of death with the boosted group relative to vaccinated but not boosted.  This number agrees with some of the published papers (see here and here ) in terms of effectiveness of boosters in reducing breakthrough infections and severe cases in the first few weeks after the booster program began, and provides some preliminary support that the booster program may help reduce risk of severe outcomes in older groups. We do not see evidence of reduced risk of death from COVID-19 from boosters in the younger (<60yr) group, but note that only 5% of this age group has received boosters, they received the boosters more recently, and there is only a single death so far in this cohort, so there is really not enough data yet to make a strong determination of this effect. While these age-stratified VE_death numbers are much higher than the unstratified numbers (13.7%), the numbers for the <60yr group both with boosters (62.7%) and without (66.6%) would comprise a substantial waning of protection vs. COVID-19 death relative to the previously reported >90% numbers. Please don't stop reading here either -- this is also not the final story. However, there are caveats and uncertainties in these data that we need to consider when trying to interpret these results.  Note the total number unvaccinated, boosted, and vaccinated but not boosted computed from these data sum to 9,103,184, which is roughly the entire Israeli population.  This raises a number of questions. Unlike the data used in the previous blog post that only Israeli residents >12yr, these data  clearly include all Israeli residents, including small children , and since vaccination is not yet available for any of those <12yr, these should be completely contained in the unvaccinated group.  Since children have exceptionally low risks of deaths from COVID-19, failure to separate this group out would severely distort the effectiveness numbers for the <60yr cohort as illustrated below. It is not clear how this dashboard counts partially vaccinated , which would include those who have either received only a single dose of vaccine or are within 7 days of their second dose.  These are either included in the Vax (NB) or Not Vax counts, but I have not been able to find documentation of which one.  If they are included in the vaccinated group, this would attenuate the vaccine effectiveness under the condition that a single dose provides less protection than a two-dose regimen, as is clear in other published data. It is also not clear how the previously infected are counted in this table.  Israel did not make vaccination available to those previously infected until March 2021, and then only offered a single dose, and this was optional, since previously infected were given ""green pass"" immune passports whether vaccinated or not.  As a result, a substantial proportion of previously infected may remain unvaccinated, and these are likely included in the Not Vax group.  Since we know that most previously infected retain robust immune protection , the failure to remove or stratify out the previously infected in these data has the potential to attenuate vaccine or booster effectiveness data.  Note that most published papers on Israeli data that perform rigorous modeling remove these previously infected, but the dashboard does not provide this information so I was not able to remove them here. These factors might have a strong impact on the effectiveness estimates.  While I can't do anything about the partially vaccinated or previously infected with the information available to me here, we can try to separate out the <12yr old population from the <60yr numbers in the table. There are other data sets shared on the dashboard that only include numbers for >12yr (including the one in the previous post) that suggest a total population >12yr of 6,876,056.   Subtracting from the 9,105,184 total here, we get an estimated 2,229,128 Israeli residents <12yr in these data.  Given children <12yr have not been eligible for vaccination yet, all of these are among the 3,300,794 unvaccinated in the <60yr group.    We see 23 unvaccinated COVID-19 deaths in the <60 age group.  While the MoH doesn't split out how many of these deaths are from individuals <12yr, it is clear from other data that the risk for death from COVID-19 is orders of magnitude less for children <12yr than adults 50-59, 40-49, or even 30-39.  Based on this, we expect none of these deaths are in the <12yr group, or at most 1.    So if we assume no COVID-19 deaths <12yr and pull out the children into their own age category, we see: Note that >2/3 of the unvaccinated individuals (2,229,128/3,300,794)  in the <60yr group and >64% of the total unvaccinated in the population (2,229,128/3,456,060) are children <12yr.   Given the lack of deaths in this cohort, we see that the normalized rates per 100k in the unvaccinated group for adults 12-60yr increase substantially when the children are separated out. While the rate of unvaccinated COVID-19 deaths in the full <60yr group was 0.70 per 100k, when the children <12yr are separated out, the rate of unvaccinated COVID-19 deaths in the 12-60yr group more than triples to 2.15 per 100k (even if we assume 1 of the COVID-19 deaths was in the <12yr group this number still increases to 2.05).  Thus, if we recompute the effectiveness of vaccines/boosters in preventing COVID-19 deaths further sub-stratifying the children out of the <60yr group, we get the following numbers: When we split the children out from the <60yr group, we see that the effectiveness of the booster in reducing the rate of COVID-19 deaths relative to unvaccinated is 87.9%, much closer to the 93.8% we saw in the >60yr group.    Further, this 12-60yr fully vaccinated age group seems to have been strongly protected vs. COVID-19 death during this time period, even without boosting, with effectiveness of 89.3% suggesting that full vaccination prevents ~90% of COVID-19 deaths that would have occurred in this age group sans vaccination. This high effectiveness was obscured in the combined <60yr analysis, since the systematic differences between the <12yr group and 12-60yr groups with respect to both the exposure (vaccination/booster) rates and outcome (risk of COVID-19 death) rates induce another Simpson Effect , and leads to greatly attenuated effectiveness estimates if we pool these groups together. It appears that the failure to separate out the <12yr children contributed even more strongly to the low overall 13.7% effectiveness numbers than the failure to split into >60yr/<60yr, since the ""overall"" effectiveness vs. death for the >12yr combined group (69.4% for vaccinated, boosted or not) is much higher. Thus, it is absolutely critical to separate children out as their own stratum when assessing vaccine effectiveness vs. COVID-19 related events. Conclusions from COVID-19 Death Analysis: These data affirm the points made in the previous blog post: that it is crucial to stratify by a strong confounding factor such as age when estimating vaccine (or booster) effectiveness vs. COVID-related events to avoid Simpson's paradox induced distortions, and these data further illustrate how crucial it is to further separate out children into their own stratum. Thus, our final analysis of these data stratify into 3 age groups (<12yr, 12yr-60yr, >60yr).  In the older >60yr group, we see higher VE_death for boosters than those fully vaccinated who have not received boosters yet.   This agrees with a medRXiv paper from Israeli researchers presenting a rigorous analysis that shows that based on the first few weeks' data, the boosters greatly reduce risk of severe infections for older subjects.  Apparently, in this older group, the  observed waning immunity (also shown by this same group in a different medRXiv paper ) extends to reduced protection vs. advanced outcomes like severe disease and death.  This provides some support for the use of boosters in the older population, since it seems the extra flurry of circulating neutralizing antibodies induced by the booster may be effective in reducing risk of severe disease and death for this cohort. The effectiveness numbers for >60yr vs serious illness, critical disease, and death (~70%) is considerably lower than what was seen by Israeli groups who removed previously infected from the unvaccinated and adjusted for other confounders, with 91% effectiveness vs serious disease for those vaccinated more recently and 86% for those vaccinated back in January or February.  it is possible our numbers are attenuated by the inclusion of previously infected, especially in the unvaccinated  group. https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.24.21262423v1 However, for the younger 12yr-60yr group, we see high effectiveness in preventing COVID-19 death in the vaccinated group, whether boosted or not.   With only 7.2% boosted in this age group and their booster shots being so recent, we do not yet have substantial evidence in these data to evaluate the effect of boosters. However, there is likely another latent Simpson's effect in the data for this age group.  Given that most of those 7.2% boosted are in the older age groups, 40-59yr, and this age group has much higher risk for COVID-19 death than those 12-39yr, it is plausible that the effectiveness of boosters vs. COVID-19 deaths or critical disease is >>90%.  Since the MoH dashboard does not split out in such fine age groups, we can't tell from these data.  While it is possible that once we have more complete data, we will see a further reduction in risk of COVID-19 death in younger adults with booster, during this time period, it appears adults 12yr-60yr are strongly protected vs. COVID-19 death by vaccination (~90%), whether boosted or not. Also, since this age group was vaccinated more recently the >60yr group, it is possible that the ""waning"" effect observed in the older Israeli residents has not kicked in yet but later will, further reducing the protection of 2-dose vaccination vs. COVID-19 deaths and possibly making boosters necessary to restore the same protection.  However, since adults 40+ had access to vaccines starting January 19, and 16+ starting February 1 , which is 6-7 months before this time period, it seems like many of the adults 16yr-60yr had been fully vaccinated >5m before this time period so should have begun to experience any potential waning effect. While it is possible that we will see stronger booster effects even in the younger age groups once we have more complete data on boosters in this age group and more time for immune protection from the first two shots to potentially wane,  it is still not clear to me whether a booster is needed to retain strong protection against COVID-19 death (or as we see later, against severe or critical disease) for the younger age groups -- data from the next couple months should tell us a lot as a higher proportion of this group receives 3rd shot boosters. While these data are interesting to evaluate in light of decisions to roll out boosters or not, it is important not to draw firm conclusions given the short period of time since the booster program started, the small number of boosted in the younger adult age groups, and the time it takes for advanced outcomes like COVID-19 deaths to manifest.  Nonetheless, these data show that vaccination, with or without boosting, still provides substantial protection vs. death from COVID-19, and any narrative suggesting the vaccines are not effectively preventing COVID-19 deaths is countered by these data. Effectiveness of Vaccination and Boosters against Critical COVID-19 Infections I performed these same analyses for the MoH data on what they call ""critical COVID-19 infections.""  It is unclear to me how they define this, but it appears to be something very strict like ICU admissions given the relatively low numbers, comparable to the COVID-19 death numbers.  Here are the numbers for critical COVID-19 disease: We once again see a strong Simpson's effect with age, in that the estimated effectiveness vs. critical disease for both age groups are much higher than the overall number.  And, one again, the inclusion of children <12yrs in the <60yr group can also distort those numbers. Again it is not clear how many of the 195 unvaccinated critical cases in the <60yr group were <12yr, but given other data showing the risk of critical disease is so much less for <12 than others in the 30-60yr groups, it is likely safe to assume there are very few.  Here we have assumed zero, but if you would like to see how the numbers would change if you assume a different number of critical cases in unvaccinated <12yr, it is straightforward to recompute the numbers given these changes. Here are the numbers with children separated out, assuming for now no critical COVID-19 cases in children. Similarly,  we see the effectiveness estimates for the younger adult group greatly increase when the children are stratified out. Overall, these data suggest very strong protection against critical COVID-19 disease in the 12yr-60yr group, with or without boosters, and for the >60yr group, the protection seems clearly stronger with boosters. Effectiveness of Vaccination and Boosters against Serious COVID-19 Infections Next we repeated these analyses for ""severe cases.""  Again, it is not clear exactly how the MoH defines this, but it seems to include hospitalized cases as well as cases with certain advanced symptoms like very low pulseox.  There are many more events in this group than the critical disease group.  Here are the numbers for serious COVID-19 disease: Once again, we see a strong Simpson's effect for age. Here are the numbers with children separated out, assuming for now no serious COVID-19 cases in children (it is likely there are some serious cases in the <12yr age group, but again this should comprise a very small proportion of the total in the <60yr group -- and please feel free to recompute with different assumptions on number of serious cases in unvaccinated <12yr): We also see very strong protection against serious COVID-19 disease in the 12-60yr group, with or without boosters, and for the >60yr group, the protection seems clearly stronger with boosters. All of these data are consistent, suggesting the vaccines continue to provide strong protection  vs. severe disease, critical disease or COVID-19 death. For the older >60yr group, we see substantial protection vs. severe disease, critical disease or COVID-19 death from vaccination even with boosters (~70%), but this protection appears to have waned from the earlier reported numbers of >90%.  However, a substantial proportion of this age group has already received boosters, and these have restored protection vs. severe disease, critical disease or death to very high levels (~93-96%) demonstrating a 4-fold to 6-fold reduction of risk of severe disease, critical disease, or COVID-19 deaths.  Even though little time has passed since the booster program started, this provide support for their use in the older adult age group, especially at this time when the current Delta surge leads to high risk of exposure for this vulnerable population. For the younger 12yr-60yr age group, we see vaccination provides a very high level of protection (~90%) vs. severe disease, critical disease, or COVID-19 death, whether boosted or not.  These data do not provide any support for the benefit of boosters in these age groups, but given the low proportion boosted so far and the potential of a remaining Simpson's effect attenuating the estimated booster effectiveness numbers in this analysis , it is possible that as more time passes later data could reveal boosters provide a further reduction of risk. Data and Details of Calculation: I downloaded the data for this post from the Israeli MoH dashboard on September 9, 2021.  The datasets I downloaded include: Daily COVID-19 deaths from August 10 - September 8: Israel deaths Aug10-Sept8 .xlsx Download XLSX • 12KB This spreadsheet was downloaded on the MoH dashboard from the section that is on the left side, second last section from the bottom. Daily serious and critical cases from August 10 - September 8: Israel new daily severe and critical Aug10 to Sept8 .xlsx Download XLSX • 15KB This data set was downloaded from the top middle section of the MoH dashboard. Daily number vaccinated from August 10 - September 8: daily vaccination numbers downloaded .xlsx Download XLSX • 13KB This data set was downloaded from the top right section of the MoH dashboard. All three of these data sets have the same format: date, age group (overall, <60, >60), and raw counts of the variable (death, vaccination, severe case, critical case) split by unvaccinated, boosted, and vaccinated (not boosted), as well as normalized counts per 100k.  I could not find documentation for the MoH definition of ""severe"" and ""critical"" disease, but based on the numbers it seems ""critical"" is likely ICU stays and ""severe"" a much broader category that includes hospitalizations or perhaps also including other severe symptoms (e.g. very low blood oxygen levels). For some strange reason the ordering of rows by age group is not consistent within or between spreadsheets, so it required care to collate these data sets together into a common spreadsheet. I split the rows into 3 sections: overall, <60, and >60, and within each section each row was 1 day between Aug10 and Sept8.    From these collated data, I did the following calculations: 1. Inferring of total numbers unvaccinated/boosted/vaccinated-not-boosted per day: These numbers were not provided on the dashboard (as far as I could tell), but they could be inferred from the downloaded tables since each provided both raw counts and normalized counter per 100k for all outcomes, vaccination categories, age groups, and dates.    For example, on September 6, the ""vaccinations"" spreadsheet reports a raw count of 412 in the ""boosted"" column with corresponding normalized rate of 19.1 in the ""boosted per 100k"" column.  From this, based on some simple algebra based reversing the equation above for computing rates per 100k,  we can infer the total boosted population on September 6: Total boosted population on Sept6 = 412*100,000/19.1 = 2,157,068 To check the math, you can see 412 out of a population of 2,157,068 yields a proportion of 412/2,157,068 = 0.000191, which when shifting the decimal place 5 places to the right corresponds to a normalized rate of 19.1 per 100k. This can be repeated for all days, age groups (all/<60/>60), and vaccination categories (boosted/unvaccinated/vaccinated but not yet boosted) to get corresponding daily counts in the population.  We could compute this from any of the outcomes (deaths, severe cases, critical cases, vaccinations), and if you do this within the attached spreadsheets, you will see that they all yield similar population level results, subject to differential rounding errors since the rates per 100k are rounded to 1 decimal place.  Thus, we used the data from the  ""daily vaccinations"" spreadsheet to compute the population numbers, since these had the largest daily raw counts of all the outcomes and thus least affected by roundoff error and most accurate. 2. Estimating average population numbers over the August 10 - September 8 time period Given that more people are vaccinated and boosted every day, the total number of boosted, unvaccinated, and vaccinated-not-boosted change from day to day.  To compute effectiveness numbers, I averaged each of these numbers over all of the days in the time period, separately by age group, and used these numbers as ""population numbers"" reported in the tables. 3. Computing overall raw counts normalized rates/100k for each outcome/vaccination group For each outcome (death, severe disease, critical disease) and vaccine group, I summed the counts over all days to get the raw numbers of each outcome to put into the table, and divided by the average population numbers in those categories to get the normalized rates per 100k for the table.  These normalized rates were then used to compute the vaccine effectiveness numbers for boosters or vaccination-without-boosters as described above.  This was repeated for each age group (overall, <60, >60).

Gartner analysts predict that numerous AI initiatives will move quickly from the first stage of the hype cycle to the final one over the next two to five years. Image: Gartner Users want more than artificial intelligence can provide at the moment but those capabilities are changing fast, according to Gartner's Hype Cycle for Artificial Intelligence 2021 report. Gartner analysts described 34 types of AI technologies in the report and also noted that the AI hype cycle is more fast-paced, with an above-average number of innovations reaching mainstream adoption within two to five years. Gartner analysts found more innovations in the innovation trigger phase of the hype cycle than usual. That means that end users are looking for specific technology capabilities that current AI tools can't quite deliver yet. Synthetic data, orchestration platforms, composite AI, governance, human-centered AI and generative AI are all in this early phase. More familiar technologies, such as edge AI, decision intelligence and knowledge graphs, are at the peak of inflated expectations phase of the hype cycle, while chatbots, autonomous vehicles and computer vision are all in the trough of disillusionment. SEE: Salesforce rolls out AI-powered workflows, contact center updates in Service Cloud Gartner analysts Shubhangi Vashisth and Svetlana Sicular wrote the report and identified these four AI mega trends: Companies are looking to operationalize AI platforms to enable reusability, scalability and governance and speed up AI adoption and growth. AI orchestration and automation platforms (AIOAPs) and model operationalization (ModelOps) reflect this trend. Innovation in AI means efficient use of all resources, including data, models and compute. Multi-experience AI, composite AI, generative AI and transformers are examples of this trend. Responsible AI includes explainable AI, risk management and AI ethics for increased trust, transparency, fairness and auditability of AI initiatives. Small and wide data approaches enable more robust analytics and AI, reduce organizations' dependency on big data and deliver more complete situational awareness. Vashisth and Sicular also see an increased focus on minimum viable products and accelerated AI development cycles, which they see as an important best practice. These six technologies are all in the ""innovation trigger"" phase of the hype cycle and are expected to hit the plateau of productivity (the end of the hype cycle) within two to five years: Composite AI AI orchestration and automation platform AI governance Generative AI Human-centered AI Synthetic data Here is a brief description of each type of AI, based on Gartner's hype cycle report. Composite AI This approach to AI combines various techniques to expand the level of knowledge representations and solve more business problems more efficiently. The goal is to build AI solutions that need less data and energy to learn. The idea is that this approach will make the tech available to companies that don't have large amounts of data but do have significant human expertise. This technology is emerging, according to Gartner, and has penetrated 5 to 20% of the target market. This technique is best when there is not enough data for traditional analysis or when the ""required type of intelligence is very hard to represent in current artificial neural networks."" AI orchestration and automation platform Companies use AIOAP to standardize DataOps, ModelOps, MLOps and deployment pipelines and put governance practices in place. This technology also unifies development, delivery and operational contexts, particularly around reusing components such as feature and model stores, monitoring, experiment management, model performance and lineage tracking. This trend is being driven by problems created by traditional siloed approaches of data management and analysis. AIOAP is emerging and has reached 1% to 5% of the target audience. SEE: Open source powers AI, yet policymakers haven't seemed to notice To implement AIOAP, Gartner recommends that companies audit current data and analytics practices, simplify data and analytic processes and use cloud service provider environments. AI governance AI governance is the practice of establishing accountability for the risks that come with using AI. Government leaders in Japan, the U.S. and Canada are setting guard rails for AI with some voluntary guidance and some binding. The analysts note that AI without governance is dangerous but putting rules in place can help establish accountability. Governance efforts should not be stand-alone initiatives and should address: Ethics, fairness and safety to protect a business and its reputation Trust and transparency Diversity Governance is emerging and has reached 1% to 5% of the target audience. Companies should set risk guidelines based on business risk appetite and regulations and ensure that humans are in the loop to mitigate AI deficiencies. Generative AI This type of AI applies what it has learned to create new content, such as text, images, video and audio files. Generative AI is most relevant to life sciences, healthcare, manufacturing, material science, media, entertainment, automotive, aerospace, defense and energy industries, according to the report. The analysts predict that generative AI will disrupt software coding and could automate up to 70% of the work done by programmers when combined with automation techniques. This technology also can be used for fraud, malware, disinformation and motivation for social unrest. SEE: 3 ways criminals use artificial intelligence in cybersecurity attacks This technology is emerging and has reached less than 1% of the target audience. The analysts recommend paying close attention to generative AI because they expect rapid adoption. Companies should prepare to deal with deepfakes , determine initial use cases and think about how synthetically generated data could speed up the analytics development cycle and lower the cost of data acquisition. Human-centered AI This approach to AI is also called augmented intelligence or human-in-the-loop and assumes people and technology are working together. This means certain tasks are completed by an algorithm and some by humans. Also, people can take over a process when the AI has reached the limits of its capabilities. HCAI can help companies manage AI risks and be more ethical and efficient with automation. According to the report, ""Many AI vendors have also shifted their positions to the more impactful and responsible HCAI approach."" HCAI is emerging and has reached 5% to 20% of the target audience. Gartner recommends establishing HCAI as a key principle and creating an AI oversight board to review all AI plans. Companies also should use AI to focus human attention where it is most needed to support digital transformation . Synthetic data Artificially generated data is one solution to the challenge of obtaining real-world data and labeling it to train AI models. Synthetic data also solves the problem of removing personally identifiable information from live data. This data is cheaper and faster to get and reduces cost and time in machine learning development. The drawbacks to this data are that it can have bias problems, miss natural anomalies or fail to contribute new information to existing data. This technology is emerging and has reached 1% to 5% of the target audience. Companies should work with specialist vendors while this technology matures and with data scientists to make sure a synthetic data set is statistically valid.

Photo courtesy Anna Surinyach/MSF Harnessing artificial intelligence to help prevent epidemics before they spread Marie McInerney Raina MacIntyre and Arunn Jegan Friday, September 10, 2021 #WCepi2021 , COVID-19 , digital technology , global health , public health , Public health and population health , vaccination Introduction by Croakey: As with the COVID-19 pandemic, health authorities usually identify epidemics through public health surveillance, but could we do it earlier by being able to mine “the vast un-curated public data available to us in this digital age”? That’s the hope and challenge from leading epidemiologist, Professor Raina MacIntyre, who heads the Biosecurity Program at the Kirby Institute, and Arunn Jegan, Advocacy Coordinator at Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). They write below on the potential for harnessing artificial intelligence and the proliferation of the internet and social media for early detection of epidemics, saying that a signal for unusual pneumonia in China could have been detected in November 2019 and that CSIRO research showed that the Ebola epidemic in West Africa could have been detected three months before the World Health Organization was aware of it. They ask: Imagine if the COVID-19 pandemic had been detected well before it spread around the world, when there was only a handful of cases contained within a small geographic location?” Readers may also be interested in the series of articles published by the Croakey Conference News Service from the recent World Congress of Epidemiology, with one on innovative Victorian disease surveillance measures and their critical role in the state’s COVID response to be published soon. Raina MacIntyre and Arunn Jegan write: The SARS-COV2 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused devastation around the world, and even in vaccinated populations, it continues to mutate into dangerous variants of concern. With the onset of the Delta variant, we assume the death toll will rise beyond five million in 2021. This is an epidemic disease, which means it grows exponentially. One case today will be five cases in a few days and then 25 cases and so on. So, time is of the essence, and the sooner you can identify epidemics, the better the prospect of stamping it out and preventing global spread. Imagine if the COVID-19 pandemic had been detected well before it spread around the world, when there was only a handful of cases contained within a small geographic location? Isolating cases and tracing and quarantining their contacts may have been enough to stop it spreading. Exponential growth and time are the enemies we face with epidemic diseases – the longer we take to act, the larger the epidemic will become and over a very short period. Just look at the Sydney outbreak which started in Bondi in June 2021. Recall the West African Ebola epidemic in 2014. It was 67 times the size of the largest previously recorded Ebola outbreak, it reached urban areas, and killed more than 11,300 people. Ebola outbreaks can kill 25 to 90 percent of those infected. In 2014-15, hundreds of health workers died, decimating the already-struggling healthcare systems of Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone. Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) responded in each of these contexts. In the Ebola outbreak, with fears of a pandemic on the horizon, organisations like the World Health Organization (WHO), MSF, and others supported national health systems by treating and isolating patients; tracing and follow up of patient contacts; raising community awareness of the disease such as how to prevent it and where to seek care; conducting safe burials; proactively detecting new cases; and supporting existing health structures. When WHO was first notified of Ebola in March 2014, it may have comprised a few 100 cases, but it grew exponentially. By August 2014, the case numbers were in the thousands, and by October over 20,000 cases had occurred. Furthermore, until only very recently, there were no tools to prevent or treat Ebola. Today a preventive vaccine and curative drugs are available. Imagine how many lives could have been saved if the epidemic had been detected when there were only a handful of cases. Prior to COVID-19 in 2019, the Ebola epidemic saw the fastest trajectory to development of a vaccine, with Phase 1 trials in Oct 2014 to the approval of this vaccine in Nov 2019. Indeed, the average time was 10-15 years prior to both COVID-19 and Ebola vaccine developments. For COVID-19, vaccines were developed and ready for use in less than 12 months, but after devastating global consequences of the pandemic and the hundreds of thousands killed in the global north. In short, it is unwise to rely solely upon vaccines and or/ their development to manage an epidemic, especially in low-resource settings. Non-pharmaceutical interventions such as testing, tracing and measures to reduce contact between people are also important. We have had a measles vaccine since the 1960s, however the disease rages through the world in epidemic proportions in over 41 countries such the Democratic Republic of Congo and Central African Republic. The primary reason behind this is a deeply inequitable, and unfair global biomedical system which has unfairly provided for wealthier countries but not low-income countries. We are seeing it play out with COVID-19, where only 1.8 per cent of people in low-income countries have received one dose, out of 5.4 billion doses administered globally. What is Australia doing in response? With COVID-19, the general public have had a taste of what epidemiologists have known for decades, that strong health surveillance is essential to getting on top of outbreaks and to have any chance of “zero elimination” strategies, or any suppression strategy for that matter, working. While the global disparity of vaccination rates persists, what new technologies is Australia investing in to helping communities get on-top of outbreaks and bolster health surveillance? How are we harnessing artificial intelligence together with the proliferation of the internet and social media for early detection of epidemics? The usual way we identify epidemics is through public health surveillance – which is when labs or doctors notify health authorities of unusual, serious, or notifiable infections. When lots of these notifications start piling up, or a trend is seen of higher case numbers than usual, the health official may investigate a possible outbreak. But people talk about illness in their communities, and local news agencies report on unusual outbreaks, long before health officials know about it. What if we could mine the vast, un-curated public data available to us in this digital age and detect signals of epidemics early? At UNSW, the EpiWatch observatory does just that, tapping into news reports from around the world, in many different languages, using algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI) to detect early outbreak signals. We showed that a signal for unusual pneumonia in China could have been detected in November 2019; and CSIRO research showed that the Ebola epidemic in West Africa could have been detected three months before WHO was aware of it. This is in no way a replacement for in-country based data collection or existing Early Warning, and Alert Response Systems (EWARS). Using AI in epidemiology is an additional tool that uses  innovative technologies and has the potential to reach communities who do not have the strongest national health surveillance systems. It can also overcome censorship of information to detect signals in countries that are withholding outbreak information from the world. Reasons for censorship include fear of impacts on tourism, trade, or other parts of the economy, or political reasons. Traditionally, declaring epidemics rest solely on the responsibility of governments, but never in human history has there been more attention on virology and epidemiology from the public. Therefore, ensuring that data-collected from the internet follows scientific modelling and surveying has never been more important. As with most emergent technology using data and information to inform a product, the ethics over use of open-source data and safe-guards will need to be in place on who this empowers. Generally, however, methods such as used by Epiwatch do not utilise identifying or private information. Moving forward the Kirby Institute at UNSW, with CSIRO Data 61 is exploring with MSF on how best AI can be utilised to detect epidemics as fast as possible and give vulnerable communities in low-income countries a fighting chance when epidemics strike. Applying our lessons learnt from the COVID-19 pandemic and Ebola, now is the right time for Australia and the humanitarian community to invest in innovative health surveillance systems, and to keep potential epidemics isolated to save lives.

About #JustJustice About #IHMayDay About Wonky Health The Naked Doctor Testimonials It’s a must to stay connected with Croakey Health Media. They know all about what’s happening in Public Health, right up to the last minute! Dr Janet Roden New South Wales Nurses and Midwives' Association HUGE congratulations to all the Croakey team on your coverage of our Summit. To say we have been delighted with the event, your coverage and the wash up is an understatement. You did such a fantastic job.  I know how much there was to synthesise! I was particularly impressed with the flair and variety in how you approached the various pieces of coverage. Leanne Wells Chief Executive Officer, Consumer Health Forum of Australia re: #ShiftingGears (2021) Croakey Health Media was the official media partner for VicHealth’s Life and Health Reimagined series (2020). Croakey’s indepth coverage of the five-week series amplified the conversation about how we can make life after coronavirus better and healthier for everyone. Croakey’s coverage included compelling articles about each week’s topic and wrap-ups of the live-streamed events, live tweeting, a Twitter takeover of the @WePublicHealth account and a podcast summarising the series. Having Croakey as our media partner enabled us to reach a more diverse public health audience and introduced new voices and experts to the discussion. Croakey’s team also generated a lively dialogue on social media about the series, driving debate and frank discussion on the important topic of how do we create a healthier, fairer, better world post-pandemic. I would highly recommend Croakey Conference News Service to anyone seeking an innovative and collaborative media partner for a conference or event. Rachel Murphy VicHealth Mental Health Victoria – Croakey Conference News Service coverage of #Lived Experience online forum Mental Health Victoria, in partnership with the Victorian Healthcare Association, ran an online forum on the importance of embedding the voice of lived experience in mental health system reform. Croakey journalist Marie McInerney did an exceptional job of covering the event through both real-time social media posts and a written article summarising the discussion and themes that arose during the forum. Her regular Twitter posts throughout the event generated lively discussion and helped emphasise and elevate the important contributions from the consumer voices. The article that Marie wrote on the event, titled “Imagine a mental health system that meets the needs of consumers and carers” took the reader on a journey through the forum’s key themes along with images and other media to supplement the discussion. It received very positive feedback from all involved. Larissa Taylor Director, Policy, Mental Health Victoria Croakey is an outstanding achievement and an absolutely essential part of the public health scene. It’s required reading for anyone who wants to know what’s happening, why, and what should be happening. Croakey is produced by an exceptional team of editors, authors and other contributors. Always a top read. Emeritus Professor Mike Daube Curtin University Croakey not only gives me up to date information on contemporary health issues, but allows me to send my health information across Australia in an instant. It is also the perfect vehicle for starting peoples’ movements, engaging with Indigenous peoples and our issues, and building a community that has at its basis a desire to make positive change happen. It is polite and political, informative and inspiring. Active engagement is what Croakey does – and I like it! Professor Kerry Arabena Public health leader If news doesn’t make you squirm it’s simply propaganda. Croakey’s unique blend of activism, humour and plain good reporting makes it an essential – if not always comfortable – read! Professor Virginia Barbour QUT Croakey is an important part of the health landscape providing progressive, current and incisive commentary. Professor Fran Baum Professor of Public Health, Flinders University Croakey is terrific. Thought provoking, well researched information….and easy to read.  A great combination. Professor Kate Conigrave Professor Addiction Medicine, The University of Sydney Croakey has been a platform which has encouraged Aboriginal voice and actively sought it out. I started out as a reader, then followed on Twitter, was a guest tweeter on @WePublic health, and have become a contributor. The more I got involved, the more I realised what an unique platform Croakey is, because of the way it challenges mainstream media.

From economic history, we know how these general-purpose technologies diffuse and transform. We also realize how hard it is to forecast when, where, and how the most disruptive changes will take place. At the same time, we have learnt what to look for, how to be ahead of the curve, and when a new technology is likely to transition from something interesting to something transformative. When the predictive accuracy of AI solutions is aligned with ease of access and use, firms can leverage predictive coding and unsupervised learning solutions with greater confidence. They can move towards a faster and more comprehensive delivering of litigation prep and advisory by understanding their client’s data through predicting where litigation is likely to occur and whether it is worth settling or moving to trial. This can occur through a comprehensive unsupervised learning approach where enterprise data is classified according to the context of which it appears within the data. Consider at a basic level identifying privilege signals, or the more sophisticated use of emotional signals that provide evidence of fraud. These outcomes are valuable for the corporate client, but they go further to providing a competitive strategy that can increase a law firm practice groups business considerably. The application of unsupervised learning and more targeting predictive coding can reduce uncertainty throughout both the discovery process and performance reporting. It’s great to show your clients a more efficient workflow, but what really matters is the tangible data that demonstrates how changing their behavior to incorporate your AI driven solutions will provide them with better results and lower fees over time. This can be used to both increase confidence in existing clients and demonstrate to new prospects how your firm can provide competitive value. Breaking it all down The essence of formulating competitive strategy is relating a company to its environment. Although the relevant environment is very broad, encompassing social as well as economic forces, the key aspect of the firm’s environment is the industry or industries in which it competes. Forces outside the industry are significant primarily in a relative sense; since outside forces usually affect all firms in the industry, the key is found in the differing abilities of firms to deal with them. The intensity of competition in an industry is neither a matter of coincidence nor bad lack. Rather, competition in an industry is rooted in its underlying economic structure and goes well beyond the behavior of current competitors. The state of competition in an industry depends on five basic forces. The collective strength of these forces determines the ultimate profit potential in the industry, where profit potential is measured in terms of long run return on invested capital. Not all industries have the same potential. They differ fundamentally in their ultimate profit potential as the collective strength of the forces differs; the forces range from intense in industries like tires, paper, and steel – where no firm earns spectacular returns – to relatively mild in industries like oil-field equipment and services, cosmetics, and toiletries – where high returns are quite common. The best strategy for a given firm is ultimately a unique construction reflecting its particular circumstances. However, at the broadest level we can identify three internally consistent generic strategies (which can be used singly or in combination) for creating such a defendable position in the long run and outperforming competitors in a practice or industry. In coping with the five competitive forces, there are three potentially successful generic strategic approaches to outperforming other firms in an industry: Overall cost leadership Differentiation Focus Effectively implementing any of these generic strategies usually requires total commitment and supporting organizational arrangements that are diluted if there is more than one primary target. The generic strategies are approaches to outperforming competitors in the industry; in some industries structure will mean that all firms can earn high returns, whereas in others, success with one of the generic strategic may be necessary just to obtain acceptable returns in an absolute sense. Overcall cost leadership Cost leadership requires aggressive construction of efficient-scale facilities, vigorous pursuit of cost reductions from experience, tight cost and overhead control, avoidance of marginal customer accounts, and cost minimization in areas like R&D, service, sales force, advertising, and so on. Achieving a low overall cost position often requires a high relative market share or other advantages, such as favorable access to raw materials. Differentiation The second generic strategy is one of differentiating the product or service offering of the firm, creating something that is perceived industrywide as being unique. Differentiation, if achieved, is a viable strategy for earning above-average returns in an industry because it creates a defensible position for coping with the five competitive forces, albeit in a different way than cost leadership. Differentiation provides insulation against competitive rivalry because of brand loyalty by customers and resulting lower sensitivity to price. It also increases margins, which avoids the need for low-cost production. The resulting customer loyalty and the need for a competitor to overcome uniqueness provide entry barriers. Focus The final generic strategy is focusing on a particular buyer group, segment of the product line, or geographic market; as with differentiation, focus may take many forms. Although the low cost and differentiation strategies are aimed at achieving their objectives industrywide, the entire focus strategy is build around serving a particular target very well, and each functional policy is developed with this in mind. The strategy rests on the premise that the firm is thus able to serve its narrow strategic target more effectively or efficiently than competitors who are competing more broadly. As a result, the firm achieves either differentiation from better meeting the needs of the particular target, or lower costs in serving this target, or both. Further thoughts Whichever strategy a firm chooses, it is critical that it defines this strategy before it begins implementing AI solutions. The value of AI is clear. It enables firms to save time and resources. It supercharges the analytic ability of attorneys across a variety of practice groups, enabling their teams with both a more comprehensive and focused understanding of the matter at hand. This in turn leads to better service and results for their clients. Competitive strategy involves positioning a business to maximize the value of the capabilities that distinguish it from its competitors. It follows that the central aspect of strategy formulation is perceptive competitor analysis. The objective of a competitor analysis is to develop a profile of the nature and success of the likely strategy changes each competitor might make, each competitor’s probable respond to the range of feasible strategic moves other firms could initiate, and each competitor’s probably reaction to the array of industry changes and broader environmental shifts that might occur. As AI advances, we’ll use machine learning to reduce uncertainty more broadly. Hence, strategic dilemmas driven by uncertainty will evolve with AI. As the cost of AI falls, machine learning will resolve a wider variety of strategic dilemmas. AI will increase the value of the complements to prediction. The data resulting from machine learning will become so important that it will help inform firms when to change their strategy and take advantage of what it has to offer.

For investors looking to invest in booming fields in the tech trade, artificial intelligence (AI) stocks are a viable play. Namely, the stock market today is home to various AI firms that employ the tech in a vast array of industries. This would be the case as the use cases for the tech continues to grow day by day. After all, not only does AI help organizations with computational issues, but the tech is constantly improving via machine learning. As a result, investors would be keeping an eye on emerging names in the field. This is evident given the latest news regarding the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (the Foundation). Namely, the Foundation is now in a four-year deal with U.K.-based AI start-up, Exscientia. Through the potentially $70 million deal, Exscientia aims to develop “novel antiviral pills that could be used to treat COVID-19 and stop future pandemics from spreading”. Accordingly, it would not surprise me to see the top artificial intelligence stocks gaining traction in the stock market now. If anything, major names in the industry continue to make plays as well. As of last week, Alphabet ( NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and C3.Ai ( NYSE: AI ) are currently working together. In detail, the partnership marks an industry-first as the duo look to accelerate enterprise AI. According to C3.Ai, they will provide industry solutions, addressing “real-world challenges” in the financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, and telecommunications industries. By and large, the market for AI and AI-focused companies continues to grow. With that being said, here are three top artificial intelligence stocks for your September 2021 watchlist. Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks To Watch Right Now Amazon.com Inc. ( NASDAQ: AMZN ) CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. ( NASDAQ: CRWD ) IBM Corporation ( NYSE: IBM ) Amazon.com Inc. Amazon is a multinational tech company that focuses on e-commerce and artificial intelligence. Namely, through its Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company offers the broadest and deepest set of machine learning services and supporting cloud infrastructure. With that, it essentially puts machine learning in the hands of every developer, data scientist, and expert practitioner. Amazon has collaborated with companies like T-Mobile ( NASDAQ: TMUS ), which has used AWS to reshape how customers relate to them. AMZN stock currently trades at $3,484.98 as of 3:51 p.m. ET. Today, the company announced an all-new line-up of Fire TV devices with its first-ever Amazon-built smart TVs. The Fire TV Omni Series integrates the Fire TV experience and far-field voice technology directly into the TV, providing an all-in-one entertainment device for streaming, cable TV, music, gaming, and more. Hands-free Alexa voice controls are always available whether the TV is on or off or when using an HDMI input. This would take integration to the next level when coupled with Amazon’s Prime subscription. In late July, the company reported its second-quarter financials. Notably, net income for the quarter increased to $7.8 billion or $15.12 per diluted share. Net sales increased by 27% year-over-year to $113.1 billion in the second quarter and operating income increased to $7.7 billion compared with $5.8 billion a year earlier. Also, the company announced a six-year collaboration with Ford ( NYSE: F ) to bring Alexa to millions of retail and commercial vehicles in North America. The deal is the industry’s broadest roll-out of the Built-in Alexa hands-free experience. All things considered, will you watch AMZN stock?

Next up, we have CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity company that utilizes its Falcon platform to detect threats and stop breaches. In essence, its Falcon platform is the first multi-tenant, cloud-native, intelligent security solution that is capable of protecting workloads across a variety of endpoints. Boasting over 19 cloud modules on its platform via a Software-as-a-Service model that spans multiple large security markets. CRWD stock currently trades at $265.45 as of 3:52 p.m. ET and has more than doubled in valuation in the past year alone. On August 31, 2021, the company reported its second-quarter financials. Diving in, it reported total revenue of $337.7 million, a 70% increase compared to a year ago. Unsurprisingly, subscription revenue made up a huge chunk of this revenue at $315.8 million. Also, its Annual Recurring Revenue increased by 70% year-over-year and grew to $1.34 billion. The company also ended the quarter with $1.79 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Not to mention, CrowdStrike continues to make massive strides on the operational front. As of yesterday, the company is now working with Medigate, an Internet-of-Things security provider for the health care industry. Through the current partnership, CrowdStrike is providing its cloud-delivered endpoints and workload protection to health care delivery organizations. To highlight, this marks the industry’s first instance of a “ consolidated view of threat activity and incident response ” according to Medigate. For these reasons, will you consider adding CRWD stock to your portfolio right now?

For the most part, the company is a leading name across the board in the world of tech. Whether it is existing tech or ground-breaking fields such as AI and quantum computing, IBM is innovating in the space. For a sense of scale, the company operates in over 171 countries across the globe. Given the reach and depth of IBM’s tech portfolio, it would make sense that investors are eyeing IBM stock now. As it stands, the company’s shares currently trade at $138.01 as of 3:54 p.m. ET. Now, despite its vast operations, IBM continues to find more room to grow. Firstly, the company is currently working with IntelePeer, a leading Communications Platform-as-a-Service (CPaaS) provider. Through the current partnership, IntelePeer’s Atmosphere CPaaS offering is now available on IBM’s Watson Assistant. In practice, it will help businesses bolster their AI-powered virtual assistants with voice capabilities, without the need for third-party integrations. Daniel Hernandez, General Manager of Data and AI at IBM said, “ IBM is bringing the latest innovations in natural language processing, automation and advancing responsible AI to Watson Assistant so that businesses can transform the customer experience and boost operational efficiency .” On top of that, IBM is also hard at work expanding its cloud-related offerings as well. Earlier this week, the company collaborated with Sumo Logic ( NASDAQ: SUMO ), a pioneering name in continuous intelligence tech. The duo announced the launch of Sumo Logic’s Continuous Intelligence Platform on the Red Hat Marketplace, an open cloud marketplace for enterprise customers. With all this in mind, would IBM stock be a top watch for you?

Credit: Getty Images With use of machine learning, researchers developed a predictive tool that may identify patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) who would not achieve steroid-free clinical remission (SFCR) at week 22 during vedolizumab (VDZ) therapy, according to a study in Scientific Reports . The investigators retrospectively obtained clinical data at baseline (week 0) and assessed the clinical activity of UC at week 22 in 34 patients who began VDZ for the induction of remission at a hospital in Japan between September 2019 and April 2020. Patients underwent blood testing at week 0, and were examined at week 22 (training cohort, cohort 1). In addition, 35 patients with UC who initiated VDZ for the induction of remission at a medical center from January 2019 to June 2020, underwent blood testing at week 0, and were examined at week 22 (cohort 2). Continue Reading Cohort 1 included 25 men and 9 women with a median age of 37 years (range, 17-92 years), and their median disease duration was 5.0 years (range, 0.1-31.0 years). Cohort 2 included 22 men and 13 women with a median age of 42 years (range, 17-90 years), and their median disease duration was 7.2 years (range, 0.6-38.0 years). Data regarding 49 clinical features for cohort 1 were collected and included sex, age, height, body weight, body mass index (BMI), disease duration, disease type (inflammation distribution), treatment history for UC, clinical activity, endoscopic activity, and 25 blood test items. The 8 leading clinical features — partial Mayo score, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, BMI, blood urea nitrogen, concomitant use of azathioprine, lymphocyte fraction, height, and C-reactive protein — at week 0, according to random forest findings, were selected for logistic regression to predict achievement or no achievement of SFCR at week 22. At week 22, 18 patients in cohort 1 (52.9%) and 13 patients in cohort 2 (37.1%) achieved SFCR. No patients in either cohort terminated VDZ treatment due to adverse events. When the top 8 clinical features were assessed using random forest findings, the predictive accuracy was 100% in cohort 1 and 68.6% in cohort 2. The analysis showed that the positive predictive value was 54.5%, and the negative predictive value was 92.3% in cohort 2. The investigators noted that their study was limited by its small sample size and that larger training and test cohorts are needed to improve the prediction model and its accuracy. “The concept and findings in this study will promote personalized medicine in UC, and they could possibly be extrapolated to other medications and diseases,” the researchers commented.

According to The Information , the social media giant is developing a suite of custom chips for its data centers. One of the processors is reportedly designed to power machine learning tasks, including the algorithm that handles Facebook’s content recommendations, while another would assist in transcoding videos to improve the quality of livestreamed videos. In addition to helping reduce its dependence on outside chipmakers, the move to custom silicon could help Facebook lower the carbon footprint of its data centers. The new chips would work alongside the third-party processors the company currently uses in its servers, and reportedly aren’t meant to completely replace what it already has. “Facebook is always exploring ways to drive greater levels of compute performance and power efficiency with our silicon partners and through our own internal efforts,” a spokesperson for the company told Engadget when we reached out to the company about the report. “We have nothing new to share on our future plans at this time."" It wouldn’t be a stretch for Facebook to dip its toes in custom silicon. The company has already dabbled in semi-custom chips. In 2019, for instance, it announced it was working on an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for video transcoding and inference work. It also wouldn't be the first company to look at designing its own chips to improve efficiency and save on costs. Google has had its Tensor chips since 2016, and, as of last year, Microsoft was reportedly exploring custom chips for its own servers as well. TRENDING 1. R.

Analytics teams now have access to a massive amount of elastic computing power and numerous sources of internal and external data. The change has also delivered access to managed cloud services that reduce the complexity of building, training, and deploying machine-learning and deep-learning models at scale. However, this doesn’t mean that there are no challenges yet to be overcome. Data scientists, data engineers, and developers still have to learn and adapt to this new environment, and there is an ever-expanding and rapidly evolving ecosystem of tools and frameworks from which to choose. Many are simply learning as they go. The very capabilities that make the cloud so exciting also create potential pitfalls. The ease of copying data across diverse systems can create governance challenges if not handled correctly, and the speed of change means data teams can bet on the wrong tool or framework and become stranded. To reduce the chance of problems and ensure an organisation can achieve the results it expects, there are six key factors that should be considered. They are: 1. Make data governance a top priority: It’s very important to enable iteration and investigation without compromising governance and security. For example, many data scientists intuitively want to copy a dataset before they start working on it. But it’s too easy to make copies, move on and forget they exist, creating a nightmare in terms of compliance, security, and privacy. 2. Forget your preconceptions: If you’re coming from an on-premises world, you’ll often bring perceptions and biases about infrastructure that no longer apply to modern platforms in the cloud. Approach the cloud from first principles and start with what you want to achieve, not what you think is possible. That’s the only way to push the boundaries and take full advantage of this new environment. 3. Be careful not to create new data silos: A key element that is closely tied to data governance is the concept of data silos. In the cloud, it’s important not to replicate the fragmentation that’s common in the on-premises world. The proliferation of tools, platforms and vendors is great for innovation, but it can also lead to redundant, inconsistent data being stored in multiple locations. 4. Maintain an open mind: One of the exciting things in data science is that frameworks and tools are evolving at an incredible pace. However, it’s critical not to get locked into an approach that limits future options when technologies fall in and out of favour. Choose a data platform that won’t tie you into one framework or one way of doing things, with an extensible architecture that can accommodate new tools and technologies as they come along. 5. Incorporate additional data sources: Cloud platforms make it significantly easier to incorporate external data from partners and data-service providers into existing models. This has been particularly important during the past year, as businesses sought to understand how the impact of COVID-19, fluctuations in the economy, and subsequent changes in consumer behaviour would affect their businesses. Some organisations used data about local infection rates, foot traffic in stores, and signals from social media to predict buying patterns and forecast inventory needs. Consider what data you could be using. 6. Reduce your complexity: AI technologies like machine learning and deep learning are immensely powerful and have a critical role to play for certain business needs, but they’re not right for every problem. Always start with the simplest option and increase complexity as needed. Try a simple linear regression or look at averages and medians. Check the accuracy of predictions and whether the ROI of increasing the accuracy justifies a more complex approach. Analytics tools are quickly becoming more powerful and able to deliver ever-greater benefits to the organisations putting them to work. By adding cloud resources to the picture, data science teams will be able to take their work even further in the future. Data science plus the cloud is a very powerful mix.

Swanson Article By Gourdin Sirles Baldassare Vinti Proskauer Rose LLP Proskauer in Life Sciences Related Practices & Jurisdictions Communications, Media & Internet Intellectual Property Litigation / Trial Practice 4th Circuit (incl. bankruptcy) Printer-friendly Email this Article Download PDF REPRINTS & PERMISSIONS Tweet Advertisement Update on Artificial Intelligence: Court Rules that AI Cannot Qualify As “Inventor” Thursday, September 9, 2021 Striking a blow to patent applicants seeking to assert inventorship by artificial intelligence (“AI”) systems, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia ruled on September 3, 2021 that an AI machine cannot qualify as an “inventor” under the Patent Act.  The fight is now expected to move to the Federal Circuit on appeal. Proskauer has been closely monitoring the quickly-developing legal treatment of AI systems, especially in view of their implications for life sciences patents.  AI’s presence in life sciences innovation is well established, for example, to predict biological targets of prospective drug molecules and to identify drug design candidates (among many other applications). As we reported in August , two countries—Australia and South Africa—have already permitted AI systems to qualify as “inventors” in patent applications.  However, hope for a worldwide trend have been dashed, at least for now. Patent applicant Stephen Thaler and his AI system called DABUS (“Device for Autonomous Bootstrapping of Unified Sentience”) is at the center of these developments.  Naming DABUS as an inventor of his applications, Thaler obtained a South African patent without debate, and successfully argued to an Australian court that the Australia Patents Act should have a flexible interpretation of “inventorship” to include AI, because such interpretation would promote innovation and further pharmaceutical research.  The USPTO, however, rejected Thaler’s application, concluding that an inventor must be a natural person under the Patent Act.  Thaler then asked the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia to vacate the USPTO’s decision and reinstate his patent application. The Court, on motions for summary judgment, affirmed the USPTO’s determination that an inventor must be a natural person.  Focusing on the “plain language” of the 2011 America Invents Act, which provided “an explicit statutory definition for the term ‘inventor,’” the Court’s decision came down to the meaning of a single word: “individual.” The Court found that meaning in a Supreme Court decision construing the term “individual” in the Torture Victim Protection Act (“TVPA”) to mean “natural person[].”  Although concerning different subject matter than the Patent Act, the District Court applied the Supreme Court’s definition of “individual” because, like the TVPA, the Patent Act used the term “individual” in its “ordinary usage,” which was “to refer to a human being.”  Indeed, 35 U.S.C. § 115(b) references the “individual” as “himself or herself,” which the Court found evidenced Congress’s clear intent to “referenc[e] a natural person.”  Further supporting this interpretation, according to the Court, were the Federal Circuit’s “consistent holdings” (albeit in a different context) that “inventors must be natural persons.” Thaler, however, encouraged the Court to interpret inventorship in a manner “consistent with the Founders’ intent in enacting the Patent and Copyright Clause,” which, according to Thaler, was “to promote disclosure of information and commercialization of new technologies.”  Taking too literal a reading of “inventor,” argued Thaler, would frustrate this intent, particularly where “it is unlikely that Congress anticipated and legislated for the specific circumstances at issue.”  Thaler warned, “excluding an entire class of inventions from patentability would undermine the patent system,” as AI-generated inventions may “one day become the primary source of innovation.”  The Court was not swayed by these arguments, which the Court characterized as based in policy, rather than law.  According to the Court, Thaler’s positions could not “override the plain meaning of a statutory term,” and in any event, “[m]atters of policy are for Congress, not the courts, to decide.”  Had Congress intended AI systems to be considered “inventors,” the Court found, Congress could have explicitly included AI systems in the definition, added in 2011, “when artificial intelligence was already in existence.” The decision, unfortunately, leaves unresolved how to obtain patent protection on innovations generated by AI systems.  However, the USPTO’s summary judgment brief hinted at a potential solution—“the use of a machine as a tool by natural person(s) does not generally preclude natural person(s) from qualifying as an inventor or joint inventors if the natural person(s) contributed to the conception of the claimed invention.”  That assertion, of course, begs the question of what happens when no natural person contributes to the invention. Thaler has indicated that he intends to appeal the District Court’s decision to the Federal Circuit.  We will continue to monitor and report developments on this novel legal issue.  The case is Thaler v. Hirshfeld , No. 1:20-cv-00903, pending in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, a copy of which can be found here . © 2021 Proskauer Rose LLP.

(Aug. 11, 2021) - Jessica Bean, a logistics management specialist at Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Keyport, at her workstation. Bean, a former U.S. Navy journalist from 1999 to 2005, has been a Department of the Navy civilian for the last four years, and is one of several employees recognized for Hispanic Heritage Month. (Courtesy photo) NEWS | Sept. 9, 2021 NUWC Division Keyport observes Hispanic Heritage Month 2021 By Lonnie Collier Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Keyport KEYPORT, Wash.  – In honor of  Hispanic Heritage Month, observed Sept. 15 to Oct. 15, NUWC Division Keyport acknowledges Jessica Bean, Obsolescence Management logistics management specialist. Bean, a former U.S. Navy journalist from 1999 to 2005, has been a Department of the Navy civilian for the last four years. “I enjoyed being (on) active duty so much,” said the Los Angeles native. “Working at Keyport was an opportunity to come back to work for the Navy. I knew I could apply the skills of being a project manager for government contractors in the commercial world, and a program manager at the Internal Revenue Service to (Naval Sea Systems Command).” She received her undergraduate degree in Business Analytics and Economics before earning a Master’s Degree in Data Science from Penn State University, University Park, Pennsylvania. As a logistics management specialist in Obsolescence Management, the former Nittany Lion is a system lead and business analyst working on predictive analytics and autonomous business processes and research. This effort improves her branch’s decision-making capabilities for Undersea In-Service Engineering products and services. “I try to remember and embrace my Hispanic heritage in all I do,” Bean said. “After all, this is a culture, a people, my ancestors. We all have culture no matter where or when we come from. These 30 days in September and October give us an opportunity to learn and remember the beauty and history of the many cultures that encompass Hispanic heritage. One of my favorite aspects of my Hispanic culture is the surrealism of the vibrant colors.” Bean is an excellent employee according to Stephen Els, Obsolescence Management branch head. “Jessica continuously seeks opportunities to implement new and enhanced obsolescence management capabilities that leverage leading edge research project output, significantly benefiting the efforts across the Obsolescence Management Division,” he said. “She’s an ambassador within the command and the local community, serving as a Keyport Circle lead, and mentoring Naval STEM student interns through the Naval Research Enterprise Internship Program.” Bean is mother to Carter, 19, Nevaeh, 16, and Selah, who is eight years old. NUWC Keyport provides technical leadership, engineering expertise, and unique facility complexes that serve to ensure sustainment of undersea warfare superiority for the United States. As one of two divisions of the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Keyport’s mission is focused on developing and applying advanced technical capabilities to test, evaluate, field, and maintain undersea warfare systems and related defense assets. These advanced technical capabilities directly support the full spectrum of Navy undersea programs.

of AI in Cybersecurity News provided by Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP Sep 09, 2021, 16:43 ET Share this article Share this article WASHINGTON , Sept. 9, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Pillsbury has published a new research report that seeks to illuminate the important role artificial intelligence stands to play in defending against cyberattacks and data leaks. Titled ""Artificial Intelligence & Cybersecurity: Balancing Innovation, Execution and Risk"" and written by The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), the 22-page report uses extensive research and expert interviews to examine how AI can help strengthen cybersecurity, how the growing need for data to train AI systems is intensifying concerns around privacy, and how companies can anticipate risk. ""As the public and private sectors have embraced digital transformation, their vulnerability to cyber threats has expanded considerably,"" said Pillsbury's firmwide Technology Industry Group leader Justin Hovey . ""However, AI tools are well-suited to address some of the largest gaps in existing cyber defenses. Our hope is that this research can help organizations better understand the technology and therefore better protect themselves and the individuals they serve."" The research features extensive interviews with leading experts including AJ Abdallat (CEO, Beyond Limits), Johan Gerber (EVP Security & Cyber Innovation, MasterCard), Ansgar Koene (Global AI Ethics & Regulatory Leader, EY), Jessica Newman (Program Lead, AI Security Initiative, UC Berkeley), Marietje Schaake (President, CyberPeace Institute and International Policy Director, Cyber Policy Center, Stanford University ), Leo Simonovich (VP & Global Head of Industrial Cyber and Digital Security, Siemens Energy) and Monique Shivanandan (CISO, HSBC). It also contains perspectives from Pillsbury lawyers, including David Stanton's views on the value of cyber risk ratings and Rafi Azim-Khan's take on the potential impact of the European Union's AI Act. Some of the data collected and examined in the report: On average, it takes approximately nine months to identify and contain a data breach (207 days to detect the issue and another 73 to rectify it). The worldwide average cost for a data breach in 2020 was US$3.86 million . Business email compromise events increased by more than 50% in 2020, while ransomware attacks were up by 160%, and third-party and supply chain intrusions almost tripled. Data security is the No. 1 reason many professionals are deploying AI, and nearly half of executives in Asia-Pacific , Europe , and the U.S. (48.9%) think AI/machine learning is the best tool to counter nation-state cyberattacks. The market value of AI in cybersecurity is predicted to reach US$46.3 billion by 2027. To read the full report, click here . Pillsbury lawyers advise public and privately held businesses on all manner of cybersecurity, data protection and privacy law issues, with particular experience in the technology, energy, financial, communications, defense/government contracts and health care sectors, as well as with critical infrastructure generally. Our multinational team of regulatory authorities, litigators, transactional lawyers, intellectual property counsel, government contracts practitioners and legislative strategists work closely with clients worldwide to monitor the rapidly changing data and cyber landscapes and tackle related security challenges. The firm's multidisciplinary AI team likewise advises companies and government agencies on the technical complexities of artificial intelligence, as well as the evolving regulatory and legal standards that apply to it. Whether in relation to machine learning, natural language processing or neural network projects, we work hand-in-hand with AI innovators, early adopters and investors to address the full range of commercial, regulatory and liability concerns they encounter.

In our times, however, Artificial Intelligence means something else. If computers and cell phones were the technological legacy of the latter 20th century, Artificial Intelligence might be the technological legacy of the 21st century. Most of us run across Artificial Intelligence regularly. When you call to make an appointment or inquire about ordering supplies on the phone, you might be talking to a computer with voice recognition technology. Sometimes when you answer your phone and hear the friendly voice of the telemarketer who responds to your responses, it may take you a while to realize you are talking to a computer, not a real human being. Have you ever searched for a product on the internet or at Amazon, only to see the product advertised on your Facebook page? How did they know? Artificial Intelligence. Computers follow recipes called algorithms that direct the computer to note what you have searched for and then to match that search with advertisers — and put the appropriate ad on your Facebook page. Computer algorithms are just an example of Artificial Intelligence at work. According to academicinfluence.com , Artificial Intelligence — abbreviated AI — “refers to computing which aims to mimic human cognitive functions like learning, problem solving, and adaptation to environmental conditions. ... Artificial Intelligence is actually an umbrella term for various areas of computing including robotics, machine learning, and Artificial neural networking (mimicking the human mind in some way) …” But AI programs can make blunders; Artificial Intelligence is not always so intelligent. Take this recent account from the BBC: “Facebook users who watched a newspaper video featuring black men were asked if they wanted to ‘keep seeing videos about primates’ by an Artificial-Intelligence recommendation system. “Facebook told BBC News it ‘was clearly an unacceptable error’, disabled the system and launched an investigation. “’We apologize to anyone who may have seen these offensive recommendations.’” Some futurists talk about singularity, a time when computers will be self-sustaining, self-improving and no longer need human help. Wikipedia defines singularity further: “... a hypothetical point in time at which technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, resulting in unforeseeable changes to human civilization ... (with( ‘runaway reaction’ of self-improvement cycles… rapidly causing an ‘explosion’ in Intelligence … (that) far surpasses all human intelligence.” Many people are afraid that computers and robots will eventually take over the world, and humans will become servants to these more intelligent pieces of technology. Not everyone is on board with such a doomsday picture. Gotquestions.org makes some good points about AI: “If a person defines Intelligence in a way that eliminates concepts such as morality, emotion, empathy, humor, relationship, and so forth, then the phrase Artificial Intelligence is not so meaningful. This is a particularly important point to keep in mind when discussing strategy games ... in which computers often defeat even the greatest human masters ... the program that bests a human in a strategy game is designed specifically for playing that game. It might win, but the human can then leave the room and do ... things that the machine cannot do. The software that allows the machine to succeed in a trivia game can’t tell you how to tie your shoes. Or make a sandwich. Or draw a flower. Or write a limerick. Nor can it comfort a sick child, pretend to be a character in a play, or watch a movie and later explain the plot to someone else. The truth is that those purpose-built AI computers are markedly less intelligent than the humans whom they defeated in narrow contests.” So where will this go? Let me illustrate. Many children today cannot print neatly; others cannot solve basic math problems apart from a calculator. Fortunately, many can do both of the above. This divide will continue to deep as AI continues to mushroom. Some of us will make the effort to develop and nurture all aspects of our humanity, while others will allow our own humanity to atrophy and take the path of resistance, always relying on AI. The robots will not take over, but some of us will surrender portions of our humanity to them. Ed Vasicek is pastor of Highland Park Church in Kokomo. Contact him at edvasicek@gmail.com .

Her Roomba robot vacuum was set to run in the middle of the night, while she, her husband, and their dogs were asleep. But one of the three dogs — a foster pooch named MacGregor — pooped in the house at around the same time. When Darby got up in the morning, there was poop smeared throughout most of her home. ""I remember walking into my office and it looked like a murder scene, but with poop,"" Darby said Thursday. In her office, she said, the Roomba ran over a power cord, then kept roving in circles, leaving tracks reminiscent of crop circles. They threw out a rug, power cords, and — after her husband tried and failed to clean it — the Roomba. Darby, who works in public relations, said she and her husband bought another Roomba and began using it during the day, but the same sort of thing eventually happened again after MacGregor had another accident indoors. (Despite the Roomba poop-spreading, Darby and her husband adopted MacGregor.) IRobot, the company that makes the Roomba, is trying to eliminate this kind of incident with the use of artificial intelligence. On Thursday iRobot ( IRBT ) announced a new Roomba robot vacuum cleaner called the j7+ that uses AI to spot and stay away from pet poop and power cords. Read More The Roomba j7+ uses artificial intelligence to avoid pet poop and cords from electronics. The vacuum, which is initially available through iRobot's website, costs $850 (or $650 if bought without a base that the vacuum can automatically empty dirt into). IRobot cofounder and CEO Colin Angle told CNN Business that while a power cord is the most common obstacle for a Roomba to get caught on, pet poop is ""the most spectacularly bad"" obstacle. (Angle, who has a dog, said this hasn't happened at his home.) The company has considered for more than five years different technologies — ranging from capacitive sensors, which can measure things like pressure, to olfactory sensors, which detect odor — for detecting waste, he said. Over time, it became more realistic to stuff the necessary computing power into the Roomba itself so that it could use machine vision to recognize pet waste. But in order to make this possible, the company first had to create a diverse dataset of poop (and no, it's not the only company that has spent time working on poop recognition ). Angle said iRobot spent years building a library of pictures of poop, real and faux. The company began, he said, by buying ""all the realistic gag poop you can buy on the internet,"" then branched out into making hundreds of Play-doh poop models, which it painted brown and photographed in different lighting and from different angles. He thinks every iRobot employee with a pet has had that animal's waste photographed from multiple angles. How your poop can help train AI The vacuum has a camera to spot obstacles, and image-recognition algorithms trained on iRobot's dataset can determine whether that obstacle appears to be poop. An accompanying smartphone app can then alert the vacuum's owner, along with a picture of the mess (or power cord). Any time an obstacle is detected, Angle said, a user can decide, via the app, if they want to contribute the image to iRobot's training data. He said the company is confident enough in the vacuum's ability to avoid pet waste that it will replace any j7+ vacuums that get in deep, er, doo-doo. ""We felt like that was an important part of conveying our conviction that we have this one under control,"" Angle said. Darby is thinking of buying the j7+. She said her family, which has since gone through several more Roombas, could use a new one.

Over the summer, the undergraduates applied their data science skills to projects that focus on the need to address quality of life issues for New York City residents in underserved communities. Graduate students from the Columbia Department of Statistics served as mentors during the program. The students presented their report via Zoom at a public BCEQ meeting on September 8. The report findings include: The dropout rate among public school students who live near highways in the Bronx is substantially higher than among those who don’t. Bronx residents who live farther from parks suffer from more health problems than those who live near green spaces. Additionally, positive effects of living near a park are less significant if the park is dirty or in disrepair, as those parks go unused. The completed report is a call to action for Bronx residents about the effects of bad environmental policy. “The series of maps produced by this research raise troubling policy implications for the maintenance and operations of parks, schools, and highway corridors,” said Dr. Robert Fanuzzi, president of BCEQ, an all-volunteer organization that is celebrating 50 years of environmental advocacy. “Columbia is working to improve the public good by expanding and diversifying the Public Interest Technology data science workforce,” said Columbia Professor Tian Zheng, principal investigator for the Columbia-Lehman Public Interest Technology Data Science Corps (PIT-DSC). “Our partnership with Lehman and BCEQ advances our mission to create data science solutions that have a societal impact.” Earlier this year, BCEQ submitted a proposal to the Columbia-Lehman PIT-DSC, which was facilitated by the Town + Gown program, a New York City-wide partnership between universities and local communities that bring academics and practitioners together to create plans for workable solutions to public issues. The proposal was selected for PIT-DSC’s inaugural summer undergraduate research program. The research was also supported by a grant from New America’s Public Interest Technology University Network . As part of the project, BCEQ board members met weekly with the research team of students from various disciplines, including sociology, math, statistics, and computer science. Led by Zi Fang , a graduate student in statistics at Columbia, the students used datasets that incorporated Census data, New Yorkers for Parks reports, and city and state agency databases to come up with their findings. “We are excited with the work of the students. We asked them to help us find out why the Bronx is still 62 out of 62 in the state for negative health outcomes,” said BCEQ Board member Karen Argenti. “The program helped BCEQ find a road to environmental justice in the Bronx.  The numbers and their correlations tell a story of less funding, staffing, maintenance, and planning for open spaces, education workforce, and development in the borough. In other words, systemic racism. I think the students learned a lot, as well.” The project was a success for everyone involved. “We are thrilled to be partnering with BCEQ and Columbia on a project that uses our students’ expertise to understand environmental conditions in the Bronx,” said Lehman Assistant Professor Jennifer Laird, co-principal investigator for PIT-DSC. “This project provides invaluable data science training for our students, most of whom are from the Bronx, and it provides stakeholders with the evidence they need to make informed policy decisions.” Tags Public Health Local News September 13, 2021 In the Libraries: September at George Bruce September 13, 2021 Construction Update: Weeks of 9/13/21 and 9/20/21 September 10, 2021 Commemorate the 20th Anniversary of September 11 in Upper Manhattan September 09, 2021 Columbia University and Pfizer to Establish Clinical Trials Diversity Initiative September 09, 2021 Learn How Students Used Data Science to Explore Health, Wealth, and Education in the Bronx The Office of Government & Community Affairs 309 Low Library, 535 West 116th Street  ·  New York,  NY 10027 Phone (212) 854-5915 Internal Use Only Login to Access Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram Columbia University ©2021 Columbia University Accessibility Nondiscrimination Careers Built using Columbia Sites Back to Top Close"

AIML will bring experience in applying AI, computer vision and machine learning to real world problems. Microsoft’s experience in advanced cloud computing and cognitive systems is informing Azure Space. Azure Space is being built as a set of cloud offerings that allow organisations to leverage geospatial data, access bandwidth anywhere, digitally engineer space systems and engage in remote edge computing. This can all be applied in space. “The relationship with Microsoft will give us access to cloud-based platforms that will allow us to focus on the investigation on the performance of algorithms, used to analyse large amounts of earth-observation data from satellites without needing to be concerned about gaining access to space at the onset,” University of Adelaide professor Tat-Jun Chin said. “Our work on these algorithms has the potential to contribute to many applications, including agricultural land management, water management, mining practices and understanding of economic activity.” Microsoft Australia Azure Space engineer Nicholas Moretti, is now based at Adelaide’s innovation precinct, Lot Fourteen. “I first got exposed to the space industry while I was studying for my undergraduate degree at the University of Adelaide and crossed paths with Professor Chin,” Moretti said. “Although focused on in-space technologies, Project AI Off Earth will explore how space related technologies and data, and cognitive systems can be used to support automation of multiple different industries, help establish smart cities, as well as address sustainability and important environment challenges.” Microsoft and AIML are already collaborating using Microsoft Azure Orbital Emulator, a cloud-based native space emulation environment that enables massive satellite constellation simulations. Using this, AIML and Project AI Off Earth can develop, evaluate and train algorithms, machine learning models and AI intended for space without the need to launch a satellite. “Adelaide has established itself as the very heart of Australia’s space industry,” SA minister for Trade and Investment Stephen Patterson said. “This agreement between AIML and Microsoft, which is building a space team, is a signal of what’s to come. Australia has the opportunity to be a leading player in the global space industry and this sort of international collaboration – centred on Adelaide but with a truly global focus – will strengthen the local industry, help build skills in this important area and reinforce Adelaide’s reputation as the epicentre of space activity in this part of the world.” Moretti and Chin discuss the new partnership between Microsoft and the University of Adelaide’s AIML in the video below.

More content below AMZN Shot Efficiency and Passing Profile bring the total number of advanced statistics to eight, using AWS machine learning and analytics to give fans deeper insights into the game of football SEATTLE, September 09, 2021 --( BUSINESS WIRE )--Today, Amazon Web Services (AWS), an Amazon.com , Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), and the German Bundesliga, Germany’s top national football league, announced two new Bundesliga Match Facts powered by AWS that will premier as graphics during broadcasts and in the official Bundesliga app during the 2021 – 22 season. The first advanced stat, Shot Efficiency, compares the actual number of goals that a player or team has scored with how many goals the player or team should have scored based on the quality of their chances. The second, Passing Profile, provides deeper insights into the pass quality of a player or an entire team. Both stats will debut during Matchday 4 on September 11, 2021, featuring the faceoff between German Champion FC Bayern München and the second-place team of the previous season, RB Leipzig. For more information, videos, and blogs about each stat, visit aws.amazon.com/sports/bundesliga . This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210909005938/en/ Passing Profile, one of the new Bundesliga Match Facts powered by AWS for the 21-22 season. (Graphic: Business Wire) Bundesliga Match Facts help audiences better understand nuanced aspects of the game of football, such as decision making on the pitch or what goes into exceptional player performance. Bundesliga generates the Match Facts by gathering and analyzing the match feeds from live games in real time as they’re streamed into AWS. On the backend, Bundesliga uses AWS capabilities in analytics, machine learning, compute, storage, database, serverless, and media services to process and store the vast amount of data that powers these statistics, as well as to train, deploy, and scale the machine learning models used to generate predictions. Fans see the insights as graphics during broadcasts, with additional details in the official Bundesliga app. The two new Match Facts will better showcase the action on the field and give fans, coaches, players, and commentators visual support for analyzing players’ and teams’ performance. Story continues New Bundesliga Match Facts for the 2021–22 season powered by AWS Shot Efficiency: Football fans love to revisit and break down scoring opportunities to better celebrate or mourn key game moments. This new stat helps fans determine which players or teams best exploit their chances at scoring a goal. It compares the number of goals that a player or team has actually scored with the cumulative value from Expected Goals (xGoals)—an existing Bundesliga Match Fact—which is the number of goals the player or team should have scored based on the quality of their attempted shots. The difference between these two values is the Shot Efficiency number. If the value is negative (shown on TV by a red arrow pointing down), the player or team has scored fewer goals than would have been expected. If the value is positive (green arrow up), the player or team exceeded the expected value. For the first time, each player’s efficiency can be objectively assessed based on the overall quality of shots and the number of goals scored. For example, this advanced stat can compare two strikers who scored the same number of goals after 10 matchdays to determine which player is converting goals in challenging versus easy situations. Commentators can also use the stat, for instance, to analyze if players have a high number of goals because they are well supported by their teammates or because they exploit openings in the defense. Passing Profile: Fans often put themselves into a player’s shoes and compare the choices they might have made in a given situation to what the player actually did. This new stat helps fans understand how players think and decide where to pass the ball. It also provides deeper insights into the pass quality and pass strength of players and teams, including which passing decisions they prioritize, such as an offensive pass, passing the ball back, or opening up play with a long ball. Before Passing Profile, the effectiveness of player passing was measured primarily by the number of passes that successfully reach a player’s target; now, with Passing Profile, it is possible to assess the quality of passes too, accounting for pass difficulty. For instance, by looking at how many opponents press the recipient and passer, how high the ball is in the air, and how many opponents were positioned between the recipient and passer, the stat calculates the pass difficulty rating. It also offers further insights into the passing behavior of a player or team by identifying the number of long and short passes, pass direction, and the type of passes a player favors. To develop these stats, machine learning models trained on Amazon SageMaker (AWS’s service that enables data scientists and developers to build, train, and deploy machine learning models quickly) analyzed thousands of video hours of previous Bundesliga seasons. In the case of Shot Efficiency, Bundesliga trained its machine learning models on a dataset of more than 40,000 historical shots on goal, which includes features derived from player positional data, such as distance to goal, angle to goal, player speed, number of defenders in the line of a shot, and goalkeeper coverage. In the case of Passing Profile, Bundesliga analyzed video of nearly 2 million passes and used that data to construct an algorithm that computes a difficulty score for each pass at any moment, evaluating characteristics such as distance to the receiver, the number of defending players in between, and pressure on a player. Once computed, Bundesliga aggregates difficulty scores for each player and team to form a passing profile. ""Bundesliga Match Facts powered by AWS allow us to give fans more insight into the game of football, broadcasters more interesting stories to tell, and coaches and teams more data to excel at their game. Last year, the reception for Bundesliga Match Facts around the world was very positive, and we will continue to raise the bar and innovate on these analytics using machine learning to make them even better. The two new stats for this season give fans a view into player efficiency that hasn’t been achieved before, and we are still just at the beginning of our relationship with AWS. I’m excited to see how technology will continue to evolve the fan experience and the game,"" said Andreas Heyden, Executive Vice President of Digital Innovations for DFL Deutsche Fußball Liga (DFL) Group. ""Teams, leagues, broadcasters, and their partners from across the sports world are using AWS to build data-driven solutions and elevate the fan experience. We’re excited to continue our work with Bundesliga to connect with their fans in a way they haven’t been able to before this collaboration,"" said Klaus Buerg, General Manager for AWS Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, Amazon Web Services EMEA SARL. ""Through the work we’ve accomplished with Bundesliga in creating eight Bundesliga Match Facts in a short period of time, we are giving fans a new way to appreciate player speed, field positioning, goals, passing, and shot efficiency, creating even more excitement in watching the game."" These two new Match Facts join Speed Alert , Goal Probability, xGoals , Most Pressed Player , Attacking Zones , and Average Positions: Trends to bring the total number of insights available for Bundesliga fans to eight. Information on all of these statistics can be found at aws.amazon.com/sports/bundesliga/ . Football fans also can follow all of the latest Bundesliga action on Bundesliga.com and via the official Facebook , Twitter , and Instagram channels.

The MCA award is the only cross-disciplined, career-oriented award that aims to protect the time and resources of mid-career scholars, enabling applicants the opportunity to concentrate on research and training while building synergistic and mutually beneficial partnerships. Wenwen Li, professor in the ASU School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning. Download Full Image “I am super excited and humbled to receive this Mid-Career Advancement award from NSF. In preparation of the proposal, I have received tremendous support from many of my ASU colleagues, and I cannot thank them enough,” said Li, who specializes in spatial analysis and using cyberinfrastructure and artificial intelligence to explore new questions about the geographic world. “I am viewing this award not only as an opportunity to advance my own career, but also a good timing to return my service back to the community to help junior and other mid-career scholars to boost their careers, increase visibility, develop leadership to achieve amazing success and happiness.” The award will support Li’s research that explores new ways of integrating artificial intelligence, geospatial analysis and cyberinfrastructure into Arctic permafrost research. In partnership with Anna Liljedahl, an Arctic permafrost hydrology expert from Woodwell Climate Research Center, Li aims to develop novel GeoAI (geospatial artificial intelligence) solutions to enable automated, high-resolution mapping and the quantification of permafrost thaw at a pan-Arctic scale. “Polar regions play a vital role in Earth’s climate, ecosystems and economy. Unfortunately, climate change is driving dramatic changes in the Arctic ecosystem, endangering its natural environment, infrastructure and lives,” Li said. “Arctic permafrost, ground that remains below 0 degrees Celsius for at least two consecutive summers, is at the center of this change.” By developing new GeoAI solutions, Li and Liljedahl hope to create a high-resolution dataset that quantifies permafrost thaw and helps scientists gain a better understanding and accurate prediction of the landscape changes in the Arctic. Additionally, the research pair will co-create an initiative called “Women in Polar Cyberinfrastructure” to diversify the field of cyberinfrastructure, AI and Arctic science by offering training to more female scholars and underrepresented minorities. “I have always had a great interest in applying data science methods to solve environmental problems, especially those endangering the polar regions,” Li said. “This award focuses exactly on career advancement in polar data science; it offers an exciting opportunity for me to build a large collaboration network with Arctic scientists to broaden and deepen the applications of various computational solutions that my team has developed for better problem solving in the Arctic.” University News Tempe campus School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Spatial Analysis Research Center Grants / Awards Research Environment Faculty David Rozul Communications Specialist, School of Geographical Sciences and Urban Planning 480-727-8627 david.rozul@asu.edu Next Story How engineering grads get their dream jobs For someone who grew up playing Xbox, working for Microsoft Devices — the team behind that gaming console and many other devices people use every day — is the definition of a dream job.

Fulton Schools of Engineering Career Center cultivates relationships with industry, offering opportunities to prepare students for top tech careers September 9, 2021 For someone who grew up playing Xbox, working for Microsoft Devices — the team behind that gaming console and many other devices people use every day — is the definition of a dream job. And it could be your dream job, if you’re an engineering major in the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering at Arizona State University. Such high-profile jobs may seem out of reach for some, but they’re not impossible to get — and companies like Microsoft are always looking for new, highly qualified talent. Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, Washington. The Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering Career Center at Arizona State University works closely with high-profile companies, including Microsoft, to build relationships and invest in the future of a diverse engineering and technology workforce. Through these partnerships and extracurricular opportunities, Fulton Schools graduates are preparing for top tech jobs. Photo courtesy of vladdon/Shutterstock.com Download Full Image Fulton Schools students and graduates stand out among the competition for several key reasons: among them, the Fulton Schools Career Center ’s extensive resources and relationships with Microsoft and other high-profile companies, and the opportunities at the Fulton Schools designed to help students to build their skills and passion for engineering. “I’m not aware of any other engineering career centers with collaborations to the degree and volume we have,” said Robin Hammond , director of career services in the Fulton Schools. “The opportunities and mechanisms for students and employers to connect are more than just in the career center; they’re a culture in the Fulton Schools.” This environment has led to success for many Fulton Schools graduates, including several alumni who now have what they consider to be their dream jobs at Microsoft Devices. Networking and relationship-building for rewarding careers ​A shared commitment to diversity and innovation has driven the relationship between ASU and Microsoft Devices. “We’re investing in each other, and students are an extension of that relationship and investment,” Hammond said. “They want to see our students succeed as much as we do, and that’s what makes this special.” Many big-name companies regularly connect with students in a variety of ways outside of traditional career fairs. Working engineers and technologists as well as recruiters host information sessions and informal coffee chats to help get conversations going between professionals, alumni and students. They also conduct resume reviews, get involved in the classroom, attend student organization meetings and judge competitions. Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering electrical engineering alumna Mary Byron worked at Microsoft marketing events as a Microsoft Ambassador while she was an undergraduate student. Photo courtesy of Mary Byron Mary Byron , a Fulton Schools electrical engineering alumna who graduated in December 2018, is a product engineer for Xbox at Microsoft Devices and has also worked for Microsoft’s radio frequency development team. As a student, Byron attended coffee chats, a session with Microsoft Devices at a meeting of the ASU section of the Society of Women Engineers and other career events where she asked many questions so recruiters would remember her. “I believe persistence and familiarizing myself with the ones doing the recruiting helped me through the pipeline,” Byron said. The key for students to get involved in the university-industry employer relationship is Handshake , a platform that brings together students, alumni and employers. Employers often go straight to Handshake to post information sessions, interviews, internships, job opportunities and more. There, they can connect with students directly. So Hammond recommends students regularly check Handshake to seek out opportunities to learn about employers and go talk to them. Gaining experiences through getting involved While showing up to industry-hosted events is important, there’s a lot of legwork students need to do on their own to make themselves stand out to employers, Hammond said. “It’s critical to think outside of the standard curriculum and about the ways in which you can grow your skills and your technical knowledge,” she said. Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering electrical engineering alumnus Richard Rigby poses by a Microsoft sign at the company's headquarters in Redmond, Washington. Photo courtesy of Richard Rigby Richard Rigby graduated in December 2020 with an electrical engineering bachelor’s degree. He’s now an electrical engineer at Microsoft Devices working on the Surface Book and Laptop team where he designs schematics, facilitates layout design and debugs circuit boards in current and future Surface devices. Rigby took advantage of Fulton Difference opportunities as a student, but in hindsight, he believes he could have stood out more if he had been more involved in an engineering club. “Engineering clubs where you work with a team on a big project through multiple semesters is probably some of the best experience you can get as a student,” Rigby said. “Not only do you get relevant technical skills, but you also get new, exciting projects that you can put on your resume and brag about in your interviews.” Becoming adept in a particular field can be accomplished in many ways: doing independent or group projects outside of school requirements, reading books on the topic, joining working groups on Facebook or LinkedIn. Sometimes students may need to figure out their “why” — the reason students really want the type of job they want — so students should get curious and explore. The key to success here, Hammond says, is to do it because you love your field of study and you have a passion that will make an impression on employers. That’s where the Fulton Difference comes in. This guiding principle of the Fulton Schools partly focuses on fostering success beyond the classroom through extracurricular activities to enhance students’ experiences and skill-building. Researching careers and companies Students should also spend time learning about companies before meeting with their representatives. This helps students see how their passion aligns with the company’s vision. One of the most important things a student can do, Hammond says, is conduct research about a company. Much of this is individual work, looking into products and services, how the company functions and even investment reports. Together, this information can provide the same sort of knowledge a first-day employee would have. “Understanding the company from a first-day employee mindset helps you walk into an interview with more information about the organization, more confidence and the ability to ask questions about the company’s vision statement and goals and their plan to get to the next level,” Hammond said. “You’re connecting with them as a potential future teammate, and that shows a maturity, an awareness and how you are making the same type of investment in this process that they’re putting in you.” Altogether, cultivating a passion for engineering, gaining experiences and knowing a company at the level of a new employee will set students apart. “If you have that passion and share it with a first-day employee mindset, those things come together and will propel you to the next level,” Hammond said. Samuel Perez Diarte is fascinated by the inner workings of electronics. The May 2018 electrical engineering graduate explored this field as an undergraduate student through a variety of activities outside the classroom. He found an internship opportunity with Microsoft Devices that aligned with his goals, which contributed to him landing his current job. “I realized that this was what I wanted to do when I got to travel to China and take devices apart for investigations,” said Perez Diarte, who also earned a minor in business. “I’ve always loved taking things apart for fun just to try to figure out how things work, but now I was getting paid for it.” Samuel Perez Diarte, an Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering electrical engineering alumnus, attends a Microsoft Devices celebration event in September 2019. Photo courtesy of Samuel Perez Diarte Putting it all together with the Fulton Schools Career Center From first-year students to alumni, the Fulton Schools Career Center has resources to help navigate the entire career planning process. The Fulton Schools Career Center helped Rigby prepare through resume reviews with the peer career coaches — other Fulton Schools students who are trained to help with career readiness. Rigby was a peer career coach too, so he knew the value of such a resource. “I cannot express how dramatic a transformation my resume went through getting so many trained eyes on it,” Rigby said. “They had a sample resume that was created from feedback from top industry professionals, which was extremely helpful for formatting references and seeing what content my resume was missing.” The peer career coaches also helped him make effective LinkedIn and Handshake profiles for networking and reiterated the importance of attending company recruiting events, which got him in the door at Microsoft Devices. He encourages current Fulton Schools students to make time for an appointment at the career center. “The most challenging aspect of the internship and job search is knowing where to start,” Rigby said, ""especially with all the stress of homework and exams on an engineering student’s mind. You will gain a lot of clarity about your next steps, and you’ll have a new resource for asking career questions any time.” Solutions Ira A.

Today, much robotic technology is developed without considering its potentially harmful effects on society, including how these technologies can infringe on privacy or further economic inequity. The new UT Austin program will fill an important educational gap by prioritizing these issues in its curriculum. “In the next 10 years, we are going to live more closely alongside robots, and we want to be sure that those robots are fair, inclusive and free from bias,” said Junfeng Jiao, associate professor in the School of Architecture and the program lead. “And because the robots we create are reflections of ourselves, it is imperative that technologists receive an excellent ethics education. We want our students to work directly with companies to create practices and technologies that are equitable and fair.” Called CREATE (Convergent, Responsible, and Ethical AI Training Experience for Roboticists), it will offer graduate coursework and professional development in responsible design and implementation. CREATE is a collaboration among Texas Robotics, industry partners and the UT grand challenge research initiative Good Systems , which seeks to design AI technologies that benefit society. The program has been recently awarded a $3 million grant from the National Science Foundation through its Research Traineeship Program , which will support 32 doctoral students to receive coursework, mentorship, professional development, internships, and research and public service opportunities. Students will focus specifically on how to ethically design, develop and deploy service robots, which can make deliveries, work in factories and clean homes. They will consider factors such as how to design delivery service robots so they are more inclusive and can reach all people and how to ensure home service robots protect occupants’ privacy. Several notable robotics companies have also said they will offer students internships, including Sony AI, Bosch, Amazon, SparkCognition and Apptronik. Researchers involved in the program cross many disciplines at UT, including computer science, architecture, engineering, information, and public affairs. Faculty members from these units will teach courses as part of the curriculum, and two faculty members will mentor each trainee during the five-year program. Additionally, each trainee will receive help with career development, grant writing, and exposure to local startup companies. More than half of the program’s trainees will be chosen from underrepresented groups in STEM education, including women and racial minorities, to help bring much-needed diversity to the field of robotics. The coursework component, which includes five classes in ethical robotics, will be institutionalized as a graduate portfolio program and will be available to all STEM graduate students at UT Austin. “This program will enable us to educate well-rounded roboticists who are not only grounded in the technical details of designing and building autonomous robots but also are equipped to fully consider the societal implications of their work,” said Peter Stone, director of Texas Robotics and a professor of computer science. “That is a missing part in robotics education in the U.S. and the world. We believe this is a game changer for the future of robotics.” /Public Release.

(OTC: SWRM ), a software development company and aggregator of mobile applications, announced it has been retained by GTX Corp (OTC: GTXO ), a pioneer in wearable technology and the health and safety wearable device market, to develop 'health analytics' utilizing artificial intelligence (A.I.) to assist in potentially extending the human life span. Health data analytics, also known as clinical data analytics, involves the extrapolation of actionable insights from sets of patient data, typically collected from electronic devices, such as wearables. Wearables can be employed from different body parts such as head-based, foot-based, eye-based, and wrist-based. Some examples of wearable data include steps taken, food and water intake, calories burned, sleep movement, and breathing. TulsaLabs will utilize data generated from wearable devices and sensors to develop cloud-based analytics that will monitor and analyze a user's health data through long-term dataset development, utilizing artificial intelligence. The A.I. powered platform will then allow users to look for potential trends that can then be offset with lifestyle adjustments to prevent the onset of some of the most common metabolic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. ""We are very excited at the idea of utilizing artificial intelligence and wearable data to help people live better and even possibly longer lives. Through predictive analytics, users will be able to find the best course of action for health on an individual basis. Developing personalized health data will assist users in avoiding some of the more common causes of metabolic diseases and help increase the quality-of-life for individuals, and society,"" stated Chris Bailey, the CEO of AppSwarm. Patrick Bertagna, the CEO of GTX Corp, commented, ""One thing COVID has brought to the forefront is how important health is to our longevity, so combining A.I. with wearables will greatly enhance our ability to develop and bring to market powerful health and wellness solutions. We look forward to working with Chris's team and having them join the longevity revolution with us.""

As it is currently evolving, the edge is taking distributed computing up another notch. Now, instead of having all of the server nodes that represent the cluster sitting in one place running one big job or several smaller ones that can be managed by a job scheduler and workload and configuration manager, the cluster will be spread across hundreds, or thousands, or potentially tens of thousands of physically distinct and very likely latency isolated compute and storage elements. These elements could be baby clusters or single nodes – it doesn’t really matter. What matters is that many of the same techniques that are used to manage a traditional HPC cluster can be extended out to manage the edge, which will very likely be running latency sensitive AI workloads that are, for all practical purposes, best thought of as HPC. “Given all of these possible scenarios, having a consistent management layer no matter the consumption model or the location eliminates some of the complexity of this different kind of massive scale,” says Bill Wagner, chief executive officer at Bright Computing. “We don’t look at the edge in isolation because we don’t think it exists in isolation. If you think about what the edge is actually doing, it is serving as an accelerant for machine learning analytics, ultimately. And so, edge is a component in a bunch of architectures for the datacenter and outside of the datacenter that are all converging from an infrastructure perspective. “Organizations want to tackle all this stuff in a consistent way and not have siloed approaches because they know they are going to need – and will have – infrastructure in many more places than they typically have today. Fast forward a couple of years and companies will have a hybrid infrastructure that is on premises, cloud, and edge. All this complexity relating to location is building and infrastructure is spreading out all over the place. Complexity is multiplying naturally at the same time, as new applications come into the fold and new technologies – new types of compute, storage, interconnects, and abstraction layers like containers – get deployed.” Because complex problems usually require complex answers, organizations also have to reckon with public clouds and bring them into the mix, too. In some cases, cloud infrastructure will be used exactly as an on-premises HPC cluster, built from compute, storage, and networking services on one of the major public clouds in an ephemeral or reserved manner, depending on the circumstances. In other cases, given the distributed nature of the largest public clouds, which have dozens of regions and hundreds of datacenters plus thousands of other points of presence – AWS calls them CloudFront Edge locations, Google Cloud calls them Network Edge locations or content delivery network points of presence (CDN POPs), and Microsoft calls them Azure Edge Zones – the public cloud will function like edge locations for organizations. The complexity is just a little more, well, complex than even this. The lines between what is an edge, what is a datacenter, and what is in between – and there will be points of presence in between, for sure – are blurring. And a common language has not developed to accurately describe this. The various layers of edge are just another flavor of distributed computing, where workloads have to be run closer to the source of data because latency has to be low or because datasets are too big to be transmitted from so many sites back to the datacenter, or both. Scale is going to explode on many different dimensions – within each location and across locations. It is like a fractal topology. But it is even stranger than that. In some cases, the public cloud will be your edge, or one of your edges. You will still need management . In other cases, the public cloud will be your datacenter. Still need management . Their clouds are your edge. Still need management . Their edge is my edge. Still need management . Those clouds are your datacenter. Still need management . Your datacenter is your datacenter and your edges are your edges. Still need management . There will be many types of edges, but the 5G wireless network where many applications will live is a good example. Applications running on 5G base stations will be enhanced with machine learning inference and possibly localized machine learning training to provide all of us services through our smartphones and maybe our laptops and tablets and VR headsets once we have a consistent, fairly cheap, high bandwidth, low latency network in place. The magnification of scale at the edge will be immense, which is why we are calling it hyperdistributed computing here at The Next Platform , as we see a complex of compute and memory and storage inside a server within a rack, across a row, spanning a datacenter, and stretching across the vastness of the edge out to tens of billions and eventually trillions of devices. “The telco example is telling,” says Wagner, reminding everyone that 4G wavelengths can span up to 10 miles, but 5G wavelengths are about 1,000 feet, and the tradeoff we have to pay for having 10X the bandwidth moving from 4G to 5G is to have a lot more cell antennas and cell towers.” With the transition from RAN to OpenRAN, the major telcos have around 170,000 sites distributed in the United States, and each of the major telcos have tens of thousands of cell towers each. But with 5G networks, the number of sites is predicted to be in the range of 400,000 to 500,000, and that may prove to be a very conservative estimate. The difficult thing, in the early days of hyperdistributed computing with varying levels of the tightness or looseness of the coupling in clusters of machines, is to bridge the gap for people who are still thinking about edge locations as pets and not as cattle . The underlying infrastructure has to be provisioned and managed in a consistent way, whether the machines are relatively tightly coupled, as is the case with HPC simulation and modeling clusters using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) stack or Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) to lash nodes together; or loosely couple – or they might not be coupled at all – a collection of Web servers in a datacenter, perhaps, or OpenRAN servers housed underneath cell base stations. “This has to be a unified infrastructure to help cope with the complexity, and it is best to think of this as clusters of clusters, with varying degrees of loose and tight coupling,” Wagner explains. “In the end, whether or not the machines talk to each other or not doesn’t really matter as much as the realization that they all need to be provisioned and managed. In a sense, there is nothing special about having to manage a lot of any particular thing or sets of things once you have a lot of them. The scale and diversity is the issue.” Because of the high cost of cloud computing, at a certain scale and utilization level, which we have talked about here at The Next Platform recently , it becomes cost prohibitive to be only on a public cloud and it becomes much less expensive to provide infrastructure in a facility that the company owns or at least controls if they rent their co-location space and use cloud-priced hardware inside of it. “This is why the term ‘edge’ is so limiting,” says Wagner with a certain amount of exasperation. “It suggests that there are only three scenarios, and what we want to help people do with Bright Cluster Manager is get people to see that at some point infrastructure should just be liquid and we have the tools that help it behave that way no matter where it is sourced, no matter how it is priced, and no matter where it is located.” Sponsored by Bright Computing.

Artificial intelligence is a key disruptive technology for the telecommunications industry, enabling service providers to expand their service offerings. However, telecommunications companies (telcos) have yet to harness AI's potential fully in their service offerings. Although it is in the nascent stage, telcos adopt AI to improve internal operations, such as optimizing networks, building future networks, and enhancing customer experience, marketing, and sales. Telcos currently embed AI analytics in customized IoT solutions instead of providing standalone AI-based tools, platforms, and services. Telecommunications operators are likely to move beyond service-level offerings to enterprise offerings integrating AI technology. The report examines use cases and business opportunity areas for telecommunications operators, including edge infrastructure and analytics, data science services, and industry-specific solutions. Key Insights While AI is yet to emerge as a mainstream telecommunications industry offering, telcos are embedding analytics in customized IoT solutions instead of providing them as standalone AI-based tools, platforms, and services. Given the massive volume of accessible data from IOT implementations, telcos can take advantage of early AI/ML deployments to enhance enterprise solutions' capabilities. As 5G deployments increase, telcos' accessibility to data will grow, enabling them to monetize emerging opportunities in enterprise solutions and support new use cases by leveraging AI.

September 9, 2021 Mick Kulikowski For Immediate Release Jacob Jones JacobJones@ncsu.edu Ross Sozzani rsozzan@ncsu.edu Mick Kulikowski mick_kulikowski@ncsu.edu 919.218.5937 North Carolina State University will lead a national research effort to reduce both dependence on mined phosphates and the amount of phosphorus that leaches into soil and water, the National Science Foundation announced today. The research will focus on issues relevant to both food security and environmental quality. The NSF Science and Technology Center – Science and Technologies for Phosphorus Sustainability (STEPS) – will be headquartered on NC State’s Centennial Campus. It is a joint effort between NC State and eight partner institutions. The center is funded by an initial five-year, $25 million grant that is renewable for an additional five years. Phosphorus sustainability is an important and urgent societal problem. An essential chemical element, phosphorus plays a critical role in fertilizers used in food systems. But there are problems with supply – the industry relies on mined, non-renewable phosphates that could soon be depleted – as well as system inefficiencies and downstream effects on the environment. “NC State is well positioned to produce effective solutions to societal challenges that require significant interdisciplinary work and innovation, and we’re pleased to be leading this crucial effort,” said NC State Chancellor Randy Woodson. “STEPS has ambitious goals that hold the potential to make a tremendous difference in phosphorus sustainability.” Those ambitious goals include facilitating a 25% reduction in human dependence on mined phosphates and a 25% reduction in phosphorus losses to soils and water resources within 25 years, leading to enhanced resilience of food systems and reduced environmental damage. Current food production systems rely heavily on phosphorus fertilizers, most of which originate from non-renewable phosphate deposits that are mined outside of the United States. Once in the food system, only 20% of the input phosphorus is ultimately incorporated into the human diet due to multiple system losses and inefficiencies. The “lost” phosphorus accumulates in soils and freshwater sources. Without intervention, the environmental, economic and sustainability issues involving phosphorus will escalate. “Phosphorus-driven algal blooms impair safe drinking water and marine life, and the increasing flux of phosphorus to oceans also leads to an expansion of coastal dead zones,” said Ross Sozzani, professor of plant and microbial biology at NC State and a center co-deputy director. “Without intervention, the environmental, economic and sustainability issues involving phosphorus will escalate as the world’s human population grows by another 2 billion people by 2050.” “STEPS develops the materials, technologies, and best management practices to recover, recycle, and reuse phosphorus,” said Jacob Jones, the center’s director and professor of materials science and engineering at NC State. “Recycling and reusing phosphorus means developing technologies and methods to capture “lost” phosphorus in soils and surface waters – as well as in animal and human waste – and then reusing that recycled phosphorus in fertilizers.” Ross Sozzani, professor of plant and microbial biology at NC State and a center co-deputy director “The establishment of STEPS is truly a watershed event,” said Jim Elser, Bierman Professor of Ecology at the University of Montana and a co-principal investigator on the project. “Globally, phosphorus loss from agriculture is now the main driver of water quality deterioration in lakes and rivers. Yet, extensive use of fertilizer phosphorus will still be essential for achieving food security in the coming decades. Squaring that circle is the “wicked problem” that STEPS will work to solve. This is really an exciting development that will move the center of gravity of the global phosphorus sustainability movement to the United States with the STEPS team leading the charge.” STEPS will be an interdisciplinary center, integrating contributions across the physical, life, social and economic sciences. The center’s headquarters will be housed in the new Plant Sciences Building , home of the university’s Plant Sciences Initiative , on NC State’s Centennial Campus. Researchers will draw from a wide variety of academic disciplines – ranging from agricultural engineering, biomolecular and chemical engineering, and materials science to chemistry, crop sciences, economics and sociology – to develop materials and technologies that can be deployed at the human scale while considering regional and global issues. We look forward to advancing agricultural solutions together. “The NC State University Plant Sciences Building, the future home of the N.C. Plant Sciences Initiative, is different by design,” said Richard Linton, dean of NC State’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. “It was built specifically to support interdisciplinary science teams from across different colleges, working on projects to tackle grand challenges. I couldn’t think of a better headquarters for STEPS. We look forward to advancing agricultural solutions together.” STEPS will also incorporate a more than 50-year phosphorus field trial experiment at Tidewater Research Station in Plymouth, N.C. In this experiment, differing amounts of phosphorus have been applied to crops to study factors such as phosphorus-deficiency resilience as well as how phosphorus already remaining in the soil – so-called legacy phosphorus – can still contribute as a nutrient for plants. STEPS will also leverage disciplinary contributions like team science and data science, while drawing on the expertise of industry partners to help guide the center’s work. These partners include stakeholders in agribusiness, municipal water and wastewater treatment, agriculture extension services and others. “By bringing all perspectives together at the beginning and throughout the research process, we enhance the impact of the materials and technologies that we develop for adoption,” Sozzani said. STEPS also has a strong inclusivity goal. STEPS will foster progress toward a goal of more than 50% participation by members of underrepresented minority groups, including more than 50% pre-baccalaureate participation to further broaden and develop the STEM pipeline. To ensure this goal is accomplished, STEPS will use proven theoretical approaches to ensure that all its participants, especially those from groups underrepresented in science and technology – including women, minorities and people with disabilities – have experiences in STEPS that lead to their retention and career progression. “This strong commitment to inclusivity and diversity is a testament to beneficial partnerships with organizations and institutions that allow us to recruit talented participants while strengthening new research collaborations,” said Louis Martin-Vega, dean of the College of Engineering at NC State. “Diversity in thought, culture, experience and approach toward problem solving is truly required to address a societal issue that no single discipline or group can solve on its own.” The STEPS team recognizes the impact the diverse backgrounds bring toward solving key societal problems. “The STEPS team recognizes the impact that diverse backgrounds bring toward solving key societal problems,” said Sherine O. Obare, dean of the Joint School of Nanoscience and Nanoengineering at North Carolina A&T State University and UNC Greensboro and a co-principal investigator on the project. “Delivering solutions that impact people from all backgrounds require that we address the problem using different perspectives that will benefit broader communities. Our goal is to broaden the participation and create an environment where we will leverage the brainpower of individuals from diverse groups to discover new knowledge in sustainability to find transformative solutions.” STEPS will engage the public in various ways, offering a new series of continuing education courses and a continuing education certificate. STEPS partner institutions include Arizona State University, Appalachian State University, the Joint School of Nanoscience and Engineering at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University and the University of North Carolina Greensboro, the University of Florida’s Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, Marquette University, RTI International, and the University of Illinois. Paul Westerhoff, a professor of environmental engineering at Arizona State, will serve as a center co-deputy director. NC State currently leads an active NSF Engineering Research Center called ASSIST, which develops self-powered health monitoring sensors and devices. The FREEDM Systems Center, a smart grid NSF ERC formed in 2008, is also headquartered at NC State. -kulikowski- Categories: Designing Healthy and Resilient Societies News Releases Research and Innovation Tags: college of agriculture and life sciences college of engineering fertilizer phosphorus sustainability View Comments 0 total responses Leave a Response Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

In 1750—over a century before most modern business schools were founded—Malachy Postlethwayt described a school of strikingly modern design. Postlethwayt, a British pamphleteer, was planning to establish a “Merchant’s Public Counting House” where young men would be “bred to Trade” with “great advantage.” For a period of two years, students would study an array of topics ranging from arbitrage to rates of exchange, the stock market, foreign languages, and written and spoken business communication. Merchants and bookkeeping instructors often taught short commercial courses, but Postlethwayt’s proposal stands out because it sounds strikingly like the modern MBA. Though it is unclear whether his vision materialized, Postlethwayt’s plans did describe the “gentlemen” who he expected to attend. Prominent on the list were “the sons of American planters”—the children of enslavers in North America and the Caribbean (Postlethwayt 1750). Many enslavers were keenly interested in pursuing commercial education. Some kept extraordinarily complex business records, and several even published manuals and textbooks on plantation accounting and management. Plantations even participated in the equivalent of early-modern internships: while cotton and sugar planters sent their sons north to New England and across the Atlantic to Europe to be educated, other merchants and tradesmen sent their sons to the West Indies for practical experience working as bookkeepers and agents on large slave plantations. As we would say today, they sharpened their data science skills and expanded their networks. Yet these early consumers of business education—many of whom went on to own plantations and be enslavers themselves—aren’t widely covered by modern business schools. Business schools largely omit this history from their courses, even though many enslavers had built large and complex organizations, developed standardized reporting forms, and used appreciation and depreciation to value their (human) capital assets. Cotton planters tracked the number of pounds of cotton picked by every man, woman, and child, devising all kinds of strategies for accelerating the pace of labor. Business schools and students pitch themselves as change-makers. But too often the heady assumption is that change will be good—that doing good and doing well align naturally. Or, worse, that bigger change will be better change. Businesses can, of course, do lots of good, but it is neither universal nor inevitable, and the business history of slavery offers a powerful antidote to such assumptions. Planters’ brutal practices show just how much it is possible to overlook in the pursuit of profit. Big Lessons from Old Data Today, the history of slavery offers more than a general cautionary tale. The calculations of enslavers—made clear in their account books—provide detailed paper spreadsheets of output, valuations, and lives. These documents offer insights about how numbers and balance sheets can erase some things even as they make others visible. Take this example from Friendship Plantation (Figure 1), a sugar estate in British Guiana where a community of 329 enslaved people lived and worked in August 1828. The plantation used a pre-printed form—a kind of dashboard—to track key performance indicators. This form would have been completed using data gathered from other account books used on the plantation and then sent across the Atlantic so that the proprietor could manage business from afar. Monthly dashboard of data used to manage Friendship plantation, 1828. Credit: Wilberforce House, Hull City Museums and Art Galleries, UK© Hull and East Riding Museum/Bridgeman Images At the top of the form is a summary account of the enslaved people toiling on the plantation. Each person is listed in two ways—first by occupation or activity, and again by age and sex. Down the left-hand side, the form listed the many categories of labor required to run a plantation. The overseer or bookkeeper who filled out this form made additional notations, for example penciling in “Smiths” next to “Masons” and “Cooks” next to “Nurses.” At the bottom, the bookkeeper categorized those who could not work full-time, including any who were “In the Hospital,” “Invalids and Aged,” and “Children under 12 years.” Across the top enslaved people were classified again by age and sex, as Men, Women, Boys, Girls, and Children. Both row and column summed to 329, reassuring the proprietor that all had been accounted for. The report, in short, gave the absentee owner an instant “read-out” of his human property. Below the account of enslaved people, the bookkeeper filled in key details on the production of sugar and livestock. At bottom, he summarized the progress of the planting and the availability of plantains for food. Of course, reading this chart today, we are acutely aware of what is missing: nothing of the lives of the 329 men, women, and children; nothing of the brutal violence and dislocation that these individuals endured. The immense human costs of plantation slavery can only be read from between the lines. Learning from Discomfort When I use plantation account books to reconstruct planters’ reasoning, the process makes me uncomfortable. Part of it is the horror of the system: though few forms tallied up punishments like whippings, we know they were common. We also know that the threat of sale was used to terrorize individuals who would be separated from their homes and loved ones. What also makes me uneasy is how easily this brutality is hidden from view. Data offered planters distance. It helped them to treat enslaved laborers as inputs of production rather than as people. Modern data can function in similar ways, offering decision-makers distance from human considerations: executives reviewing the numbers rarely know the people the numbers represent. We can use this history to critique our own data practices. What costs do calculations highlight, and which do they overlook? And what kinds of behavior are normalized when numbers make exploitation easier to ignore? Parallel questions about what data misses might include: What do managers miss when user well-being goes unmeasured? What kinds of organizations result from focusing too narrowly on a particular metric like labor cost? Considering enslavers’ data reveals just how much it is possible to overlook in the pursuit of profit (Rosenthal 2019, 2021). The businesspeople who relied on plantation records knew slavery was immoral but chose to look away. The slave trade was abolished more than two decades before 1828, the date of the Friendship dashboard. Slavery itself would soon be banned and gradually eliminated from the British Empire. As Sven Beckert (2017) has reflected: When you read the letters of businessmen of the 1840s and 1850s, you see numerous efforts to separate business and morality into distinct realms. Merchants and manufacturers in the past did know that slavery was a moral problem, but then they tried to say that such moral considerations were extraneous to the concerns of business. Starting Conversations for Truth and Reparations Many resources are available for teaching about the history of slavery in business education. For example, a course on financial innovation—or any class covering the 2008 financial crisis—might draw on Edward Baptist’s short provocative piece (2010), “Toxic Debt, Liar Loans, and Securitized Human Beings.” A course on valuation practices might draw on Daina Ramey Berry’s work on the way enslaved people were valued across their lifecycle: from before birth to after death, when bodies were sometimes sold in the cadaver trade (2017). Even more powerful are original documents. Gridded account books constitute the spreadsheets of the 18 th and 19 th centuries. Students can examine how enslavers tracked how much cotton enslaved people picked each day and kept lists stating the financial value of each person’s body. Students studying commoditization can see traders callously sorting enslaved people into standard categories , pricing children by height and describing them as they would bushels of wheat and bales of cotton. They can consider the implications of using people as collateral for mortgages . Communities of every age and ability were reduced to fractions of people —a practice both radically different from yet parallel to the modern practice of accounting for employees as a percentage of an FTE [full-time employee]. Such documents can foster broader conversations about how businesspeople can, should, and do behave when the most profitable decisions are clearly unethical. In many cases, the lessons drawn can go beyond analogy. Online databases make it easy to connect history to the present day by following the money. When slavery was abolished in the British Empire, enslavers received financial compensation. The “Legacies of British Slave Ownership” project , hosted by University College London, lets readers track these payouts easily, seeing who was compensated and the many commercial firms funded in part by those payouts, including leading railroads and banks. Similar connections can be seen through Michael Ralph and Bill Rankin’s work (2017) on insurance of enslavers’ human property , which documents and maps their importance to companies like New York Life, Aetna, and AIG. Recent research by Mehrsa Baradaran (2014) and Destin Jenkins (2021) shows how banks and other financial intermediaries have helped maintain structural racism to the present day. While the US receives the most attention, scholars have also examined how slavery shaped many other countries—for example, Pepjin Brandon and Ulbe Bosma (2019) have analyzed the importance of trading of enslaved people to the 18 th century Dutch republic. These resources offer opportunities for us to think about connections and complicity, then and now. What are the responsibilities of businesses beyond their own present-day operations? How should businesspeople think about the practices of their suppliers and contractors? What about the sources of their funding? Rethinking Business Education When history makes it into business classrooms, the focus is often on successes and the investors, managers, and entrepreneurs that students should emulate. But cautionary tales, such as those outlined from the history of slavery here, can be at least as valuable. The dangers of not thinking critically about conventional business practices should be clear. Inspired by historical cases like this, we should ask ourselves, and encourage our students to interrogate, how the practices promoted in business school classrooms today might be viewed in 10—or 250—years.

(Graphic: Business Wire) Bundesliga Match Facts help audiences better understand nuanced aspects of the game of football, such as decision making on the pitch or what goes into exceptional player performance. Bundesliga generates the Match Facts by gathering and analyzing the match feeds from live games in real time as they’re streamed into AWS. On the backend, Bundesliga uses AWS capabilities in analytics, machine learning, compute, storage, database, serverless, and media services to process and store the vast amount of data that powers these statistics, as well as to train, deploy, and scale the machine learning models used to generate predictions. Fans see the insights as graphics during broadcasts, with additional details in the official Bundesliga app. The two new Match Facts will better showcase the action on the field and give fans, coaches, players, and commentators visual support for analyzing players’ and teams’ performance. New Bundesliga Match Facts for the 2021–22 season powered by AWS Shot Efficiency: Football fans love to revisit and break down scoring opportunities to better celebrate or mourn key game moments. This new stat helps fans determine which players or teams best exploit their chances at scoring a goal. It compares the number of goals that a player or team has actually scored with the cumulative value from Expected Goals (xGoals)—an existing Bundesliga Match Fact—which is the number of goals the player or team should have scored based on the quality of their attempted shots. The difference between these two values is the Shot Efficiency number. If the value is negative (shown on TV by a red arrow pointing down), the player or team has scored fewer goals than would have been expected. If the value is positive (green arrow up), the player or team exceeded the expected value. For the first time, each player’s efficiency can be objectively assessed based on the overall quality of shots and the number of goals scored. For example, this advanced stat can compare two strikers who scored the same number of goals after 10 matchdays to determine which player is converting goals in challenging versus easy situations. Commentators can also use the stat, for instance, to analyze if players have a high number of goals because they are well supported by their teammates or because they exploit openings in the defense. Passing Profile: Fans often put themselves into a player’s shoes and compare the choices they might have made in a given situation to what the player actually did. This new stat helps fans understand how players think and decide where to pass the ball. It also provides deeper insights into the pass quality and pass strength of players and teams, including which passing decisions they prioritize, such as an offensive pass, passing the ball back, or opening up play with a long ball. Before Passing Profile, the effectiveness of player passing was measured primarily by the number of passes that successfully reach a player’s target; now, with Passing Profile, it is possible to assess the quality of passes too, accounting for pass difficulty. For instance, by looking at how many opponents press the recipient and passer, how high the ball is in the air, and how many opponents were positioned between the recipient and passer, the stat calculates the pass difficulty rating. It also offers further insights into the passing behavior of a player or team by identifying the number of long and short passes, pass direction, and the type of passes a player favors. To develop these stats, machine learning models trained on Amazon SageMaker (AWS’s service that enables data scientists and developers to build, train, and deploy machine learning models quickly) analyzed thousands of video hours of previous Bundesliga seasons. In the case of Shot Efficiency, Bundesliga trained its machine learning models on a dataset of more than 40,000 historical shots on goal, which includes features derived from player positional data, such as distance to goal, angle to goal, player speed, number of defenders in the line of a shot, and goalkeeper coverage. In the case of Passing Profile, Bundesliga analyzed video of nearly 2 million passes and used that data to construct an algorithm that computes a difficulty score for each pass at any moment, evaluating characteristics such as distance to the receiver, the number of defending players in between, and pressure on a player. Once computed, Bundesliga aggregates difficulty scores for each player and team to form a passing profile. “Bundesliga Match Facts powered by AWS allow us to give fans more insight into the game of football, broadcasters more interesting stories to tell, and coaches and teams more data to excel at their game. Last year, the reception for Bundesliga Match Facts around the world was very positive, and we will continue to raise the bar and innovate on these analytics using machine learning to make them even better. The two new stats for this season give fans a view into player efficiency that hasn’t been achieved before, and we are still just at the beginning of our relationship with AWS. I’m excited to see how technology will continue to evolve the fan experience and the game,” said Andreas Heyden, Executive Vice President of Digital Innovations for DFL Deutsche Fußball Liga (DFL) Group. “Teams, leagues, broadcasters, and their partners from across the sports world are using AWS to build data-driven solutions and elevate the fan experience. We’re excited to continue our work with Bundesliga to connect with their fans in a way they haven’t been able to before this collaboration,” said Klaus Buerg, General Manager for AWS Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, Amazon Web Services EMEA SARL. “Through the work we’ve accomplished with Bundesliga in creating eight Bundesliga Match Facts in a short period of time, we are giving fans a new way to appreciate player speed, field positioning, goals, passing, and shot efficiency, creating even more excitement in watching the game.” These two new Match Facts join Speed Alert , Goal Probability, xGoals , Most Pressed Player , Attacking Zones , and Average Positions: Trends to bring the total number of insights available for Bundesliga fans to eight. Information on all of these statistics can be found at aws.amazon.com/sports/bundesliga/ . Football fans also can follow all of the latest Bundesliga action on Bundesliga.com and via the official Facebook , Twitter , and Instagram channels.

ABSTRACT The current pandemic outbreak clearly indicated the urgent need for tools allowing fast predictions of bioactivity of a large number of compounds, either available or at least synthesizable. In the computational chemistry toolbox, several such tools are available, with the main ones being docking and structure-activity relationship modeling either by classical linear QSAR or Machine Learning techniques. In this contribution, we focus on the comparison of the results obtained using different docking protocols on the example of the search for bioactivity of compounds containing N-N-C(S)-N scaffold at the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 virus with ACE2 human receptor interface. Based on over 1800 structures in the training set we have predicted binding properties of the complete set of nearly 600000 structures from the same class using the Machine Learning Random Forest Regressor approach.

File photo Chennai : After the enrolment came to a close, the Directorate of Technical Education (DoTE) said about 1.38 lakh students have completed the process of enrolment, uploaded certificates and made payment for registration. Dr T Purushothaman, Additional Director of Higher Education Department and Tamil Nadu Engineering Admissions (TNEA-2021) in-charge, told DT Next that Computer Science with specialisation in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Language seems to be favourite among the students this year. “The exact number of students who have opted for Computer Science course will be compiled only after the publishing the rank list,” he said. Another Higher Education Department official pointed out that competition would be intense for computer science this year, as the Class 12 marks were calculated from SSLC and Class 11 scores. According to him, approximately 60 per cent of engineering aspirants would have opted for either B Tech Computer Science or BE Computer Science, besides IT-related courses. A few years ago, electrical and electronics engineering (EEE) was the top choice, the official said, adding how instrumentation and civil engineering were the least favourite. “The importance of Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning has been increasing, as a growing number of MNCs are adopting these technologies to improve products and services, evaluate business models and enhance their decision-making process,” he said. K Ramakumar, one of the aspirants who secured 80% marks based on Classes 10 and 11, and internals is hoping to get a seat for either computer science or IT. “It would fetch a job immediately after completing the course,” he explained. S Kalaiselvi, who falls among the 7.5% quota for government school student, said: “I don’t mind even if I get Computer Science course in a college in other districts. I hope the course would help get immediate employment.” Related Tags : Computer science  | engineering aspirants Share Tweet Comments ( ) Mail Print A A × Email this article to a friend Recipient's Name Recipient’s Email Id Your Name Your Email Id Message in details Send Conversations More News - Tamil Nadu Tamil Nadu logs 1,608 new cases, 22 deaths Sep 13, 2021 12:00 AM UPSC exams in regional languages: HC asks UnionHome Secy to issue order Sep 13, 2021 12:00 AM Grant provisional admission to pvt students: AICTE Sep 12, 2021 11:59 PM TN MBBS aspirant dies by suicide, AIADMK slams govt, CM promises Bill to exempt state from NEET Sep 12, 2021 09:35 PM Mass vaccination drive in Tamil Nadu touches 28 lakh in a single day Sep 12, 2021 09:12 PM Subramania Bharathi’s important books to be translated to English: Stalin Sep 12, 2021 08:45 PM News Chennai Tamil Nadu Nation World Sports Cinema Business Citizen Truth Exposed Madras Week Food History Memories Events Chennai Landmarks Lifestyle Wellbeing Going Viral Fashion Technology Spirituality Specials World Test Championship Tokyo Olympics India vs Sri Lanka T20 India vs England TNPL Cricket About Us Terms of Use Privacy Policy Contact Us Feedback Sitemap Paper Ad Tariff Web Ad Tariff Copyright @ 2021, Daily Thanthi.

Australia needs to get on board. Electrical workers in Hai’an, China, check panels at a photovoltaic power station built in a fishpond, 19 July 2021 (STR/AFP via Getty Images) Published             13 Sep 2021            06:00 0 Comments Australia and Climate Change Climate change Technology Follow                 @AlbertPalazzo National security thinkers follow a distinct pattern when they consider Australia’s future defence requirements. For most, the preferred point of view is risk-based. A policy response is framed in military-diplomatic terms, generally a proposal for increased capability and support for the ANZUS alliance. However, such an approach downplays other potential threat offsets, namely non-risk based opportunities. Take China, for instance, and the danger its rhetoric and actions pose to the established order in the Western Pacific. That China is a national security concern is hard to dispute, but the response need not be solely a military-diplomatic one. Security assessments that leverage opportunities found in other parts of Australian society also have the potential to enhance the nation’s security. The current opportunities Australia can exploit — among others — are the technologies associated with the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) and renewable energy. In combination, both will create new approaches to energy production and manufacturing that have the potential to build a wealthier, stronger and more resilient Australia. This is not a futurist prediction. Both revolutions are already underway and other countries have begun to take advantage of the opportunities they offer. The Australian government’s interest in renewable energy is even less impressive, and can best be described as hostile and backward-looking. The leaders in adopting 4IR technologies and principles are the United States, China, Germany and Japan. Australia is a distant laggard. The Australian Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources has published a policy, which it calls Industry 4.0, and is in the process of setting up a pilot program with academia, but it is all pretty low-level and rather anaemic. It is certainly not a priority. A report by KPMG highlights in strong terms how unprepared Australian businesses are for the technological changes the 4IR will bring. The Australian government’s interest in renewable energy is even less impressive, and can best be described as hostile and backward-looking . Advances in additive manufacturing (also known as 3D printing), distributed or decentralised production, digital processing, artificial intelligence and nano-biology, for example, are already reshaping how and where products are designed and made. Convergence, driven by the internet of things , is creating networks of buyers and sellers in ways previously unimaginable and at the same time destroying existing systems of manufacturing, distribution and sale. Renewables, such as solar and wind, have plummeted in price and now cost less than any fossil fuel-based electricity production. The development of networks creates the opportunity for the efficient and productive exchange of information and energy. Once those networks are linked, distributed energy, like manufacturing, becomes possible, with small producers buying and selling energy. The cost of producing renewable energy has plummeted and is now less than any fossil fuel-based electricity production ( Mikael Kristenson /Unsplash) We should remember how quickly such transitions can occur. There was a time when few could imagine a need for the personal computer, yet, today half the world’s households have at least one, while mobile phones have more power than the mainframes of old. There is a historical urgency for Australia to seize the opportunities presented by the 4IR and the renewable revolutions if it is to secure its future. National security is ultimately about power and influence, and power typically follows the creation of wealth. Those states that grasp the opportunities of the 4IR early­ – as did the United Kingdom in the days of the First Industrial Revolution – are more likely to create conditions in which their people prosper and have the opportunity to shape their own destinies. Those who are laggards will again struggle to compete under the conditions of this new industrial age. Security thinkers must widen the debate on Australia’s future security and the country’s place in the world. They need to highlight the potential of the revolutionary technologies that are coming into service to strengthen Australia both materially and morally. There is precedent for advocating such a position. At the turn of the 20th Century, social welfare movements in Europe and the United States strove to improve the health, education and well-being of the non-elites. There was both altruistic and moral motivation in these efforts – the belief that a more capable, healthier and educated population made for a stronger and more powerful state. National security was not far from the minds of legislators who advanced numerous reforms to society. Even the Scout and Guide movements originated out of a desire to develop fitter and more capable young boys and girls who would be of greater value to the state. China and climate change present multiple risks to Australia that require different solutions on different levels. By not including opportunity in their analysis, national security thinkers are limiting solutions to the risk side of the defence equation. The result is a one-dimensional discourse that is not as useful as it could be. Highlighting 4IR opportunities, such as the potential for additive manufacturing to grow Australia’s industrial base, or the utility of information convergence to improve efficiency, could lead to policies and initiatives that allow Australia to better its position relative to other states. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions and switching to renewable energy production, for example, would eliminate the current much riskier energy policy, namely Australia’s dependence on imported liquid fuels. China and climate change present multiple risks to Australia that require different solutions on different levels. Australia’s goal in regards to China is to avoid becoming a client state or worse a satrapy, while to counter climate change will require not only zero emissions but also a more resilient and adaptive society. Each of these risks requires different solutions which make for a more complicated response. By embracing the opportunities of the 4IR and renewable energy revolutions, Australia may generate the wealth to help offset China’s dominance while providing the technologies and design systems to address climate change. The prospect of creating a single solution for two problems is one worth exploring and one in which security commentators should be taking an active interest.

Copy URL Share a link Share on Email Facebook Twitter Linked In Reddit Wechat Abstract The high brightness, low emittance electron beams achieved in modern X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) have enabled powerful X-ray imaging tools, allowing molecular systems to be imaged at picosecond time scales and sub-nanometer length scales. One of the most promising directions for increasing the brightness of XFELs is through the development of novel photocathode materials. Whereas past efforts aimed at discovering photocathode materials have typically employed trial-and-error-based iterative approaches, this work represents the first data-driven screening for high brightness photocathode materials. Through screening over 74 000 semiconducting materials, a vast photocathode dataset is generated, resulting in statistically meaningful insights into the nature of high brightness photocathode materials. This screening results in a diverse list of photocathode materials that exhibit intrinsic emittances that are up to 4x lower than currently used photocathodes. In a second effort, multiobjective screening is employed to identify the family of M 2 O (M = Na, K, Rb) that exhibits photoemission properties that are comparable to the current state-of-the-art photocathode materials, but with superior air stability. This family represents perhaps the first intrinsically bright, visible light photocathode materials that are resistant to reactions with oxygen, allowing for their transport and storage in dry air environments.

Prof Bhaskar Ramamurthi, director, IIT Madras, shares how Covid-19 has changed the classroom Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT Madras) has been ranked the best institute in India in both ‘Overall’ and ‘Engineering’ categories in the National Institute Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2021, released last week. While it has bagged the top rank in ‘Overall’ category for the third consecutive year, in ‘Engineering’ IIT Madras has been at the top for six consecutive years. Prof Bhaskar Ramamurthi, director, IIT Madras, shares with FE’s Vikram Chaudhary how Covid-19 has changed the classroom, the initiatives IIT Madras has been taking towards internationalisation, and why rankings are important but should not be the end-goal. Excerpts: How easy or difficult is it for IITs to align with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020? Related News PM Modi to lay foundation stone of university named after noted Jat figure Need of quality education in the time of Covid-19 Kerala Plus One Trial Allotment 2021 likely to be out today: Here’s how to check We were able to anticipate and implement in advance many of the recommendations of the NEP. These include multidisciplinary education, multiple exit pathways, and so on. For example, at IIT Madras, a student can pivot from one branch to another, pursuing a double degree such as aerospace with data science; we have 10-12 such upgrade pathways and these are getting popular amongst students. Today, a student can decide which stream to master in even after three years of study. Similarly, the NEP focuses on online education; through the National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning (NPTEL)—the world’s largest online repository of courses in basic sciences, engineering and select humanities and social sciences subjects—we have been experimenting with online education for about 10 years. We also launched the online BSc in Programming and Data Science degree course last year. Will you also host MOOCs to attract foreign students, like IIT Bombay has done with edX? Our NPTEL courses are taken up by a lot of people from outside India, and the BSc online degree we are planning to offer abroad, but because of the pandemic we have gone a little slow. We conduct exams in person, because integrity is important, but due to the pandemic our ability to conduct exams in person is limited. We are working with partners in foreign countries. The aim is to ensure that our online degrees are in no way inferior to on-campus degrees. How many PhD students do you currently host? We have about 3,000 PhD students and about 1,000 MS (by Research) students, so 40% of our student population is into research. Since inception, we have readied 5,600 PhD students and 4,000 MS (by Research) students—an average of 100 per year (from 1964-65 till 2014). Since 2014, IIT Madras and other IITs have been ramping up their PhD student intake, and we are graduating about 400 PhD students per year. This number (5,600 PhDs) will double in about 12 years. The need for PhD students is much higher right now; industry is doing much more R&D than it used to earlier. Has Covid-19 changed the way IITs will teach students? Before the pandemic some faculty members (especially younger ones) used to record lectures and upload on the cloud so that students could revisit these. Faculty like me were more chalk and talk. After the lockdown, all faculty members have gotten comfortable with online teaching. While we will go back to classroom teaching, we will have a much more flexible and hybrid approach. How will it benefit students? It will give them a lot more flexibility. Before the pandemic, an IIT Madras student had to be on campus physically; she could take a couple of days off, but classroom experience was a must. Going forward, students may be able to take a couple of weeks of a course online. Some things have changed forever. Even our admission process for PhD students will change. Earlier, students were required on the campus for interviews, but now we realise it was self-limiting. We are doing online interviews, saving a lot of their and our time, and have been able to reach out to some bright students from the hinterland. Have you already started changing the classroom at IIT Madras? Yes, we have started upgrading our classroom. Everything being taught is also going onto the cloud. While face-to-face teaching remains important, it will turn from simply writing on the board and transmitting information to a much more interactive process. Even with the faculty we have realised that productivity has gone up massively during the lockdown. What are your views on global rankings? Seven IITs (including IIT Madras) continue to boycott the Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings… Rankings, global or domestic, are important, but these shouldn’t be the end-goal. Taking the analogy of a classroom of 50 students, there will be toppers and those that don’t rank high. It doesn’t mean that the topper will do something unusual in life and that the 50th ranked student won’t. As far as global rankings are concerned, these don’t really help an Indian student select an Indian college. Does this imply that the NIRF is more important (for Indian institutes and students) than global rankings? Among other things, the NIRF has put hitherto unknown colleges in the student’s consideration set. For example, a college from Trichy getting ranked high on the NIRF will get into the consideration set of a student from north India as well. Have any job offers been cancelled for IIT Madras students due to the pandemic? IIT students are perceived, and rightly so, as being the cream of the crop; I don’t think a lot of our students lost job offers specifically due to the pandemic. Last year, job offers of 28-odd students were taken back, and but we were able to place many of them by running a second round of placements; this year, 14-15 students had the job offers taken away, but I am sure they’ll get placed. Why even the best of Indian institutes are not able to attract as many global students as colleges in, let’s say, UK or Australia do? We must understand that when students go to those countries for higher studies, they also want to work there. Unless India becomes an employment destination for foreigners in a big way, I don’t think we will get as many foreign students. Tell me why Indian students go to Australia to study? One reason is that most cannot get into a similarly good university in India (due to the competition). Another reason is they know they can work in Australia for some time (at high wages). The reason for going there to study is also employment. But doesn’t studying in a multicultural and multinational campus give them an edge? Certain foreign universities boldly declare that an advantage they have is global outlook… It definitely does. But also understand that some universities in the US, Australia, England and other countries have students from multiple nationalities because their survival depends on such students. They will collapse if they don’t get foreign students, and that’s why they play up such advantages (diversity on the campus). At the same time, a lot of these countries also depend on high-quality immigration. As long as Indian companies will continue hiring majorly Indians for various reasons (including the fact that there are so many qualified Indians looking for a job), I don’t think we can expect a similar kind of rush to Indian universities. How feasible is imparting engineering education in vernacular languages, both from a classroom point of view (availability of good teachers) and from a working life point of view (the knowledge of English may give Indians an advantage)? I don’t buy the second argument. Most MNCs have bigger centres in China than anywhere else in the world, and the Chinese don’t speak English, nor do Germans or Koreans or Japanese. We are the only major country that has been teaching higher education in a foreign language. From a student’s point of view, if you go to the hinterland, a lot of students have done their schooling in a local language, and many of them are from a relatively deprived background. Now if they have to deal with language once they enter an engineering college, it can get tough for them. The time has come for us to remove the language barrier for students. You can learn English on the fly during and after your engineering as well. But what about finding good vernacular teachers in engineering? Today, if you ask me to teach engineering in Tamil, I will likely mix Tamil and English to teach. Remember, students are not learning literature here, they are learning engineering, and that dissemination of knowledge should be in the tone they understand.

Singularity Hub Topics Experts Events Videos Singularity University SingularityU Global Subscribe to our newsletter Topics New Study Finds a Single Neuron Is a Surprisingly Complex Little Computer By Jason Dorrier - Sep 12, 2021 2,390 Comparing brains to computers is a long and dearly held analogy in both neuroscience and computer science. It’s not hard to see why. Our brains can perform many of the tasks we want computers to handle with an easy, mysterious grace. So, it goes, understanding the inner workings of our minds can help us build better computers ; and those computers can help us better understand our own minds. Also, if brains are like computers, knowing how much computation it takes them to do what they do can help us predict when machines will match minds. Indeed, there’s already a productive flow of knowledge between the fields. Deep learning, a powerful form of artificial intelligence , for example, is loosely modeled on the brain’s vast, layered networks of neurons. You can think of each “node” in a deep neural network as an artificial neuron. Like neurons, nodes receive signals from other nodes connected to them and perform mathematical operations to transform input into output. Depending on the signals a node receives, it may opt to send its own signal to all the nodes in its network. In this way, signals cascade through layer upon layer of nodes, progressively tuning and sharpening the algorithm. The brain works like this too. But the keyword above is loosely. Scientists know biological neurons are more complex than the artificial neurons employed in deep learning algorithms, but it’s an open question just how much more complex. In a fascinating paper published recently in the journal Neuron , a team of researchers from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem tried to get us a little closer to an answer. While they expected the results would show biological neurons are more complex—they were surprised at just how much more complex they actually are. In the study, the team found it took a five- to eight-layer neural network, or nearly 1,000 artificial neurons, to mimic the behavior of a single biological neuron from the brain’s cortex. Though the researchers caution the results are an upper bound for complexity—as opposed to an exact measurement of it—they also believe their findings might help scientists further zero in on what exactly makes biological neurons so complex. And that knowledge, perhaps, can help engineers design even more capable neural networks and AI. “[The result] forms a bridge from biological neurons to artificial neurons,” Andreas Tolias, a computational neuroscientist at Baylor College of Medicine, told Quanta last week. Amazing Brains Neurons are the cells that make up our brains. There are many different types of neurons, but generally, they have three parts: spindly, branching structures called dendrites, a cell body, and a root-like axon. On one end, dendrites connect to a network of other neurons at junctures called synapses. At the other end, the axon forms synapses with a different population of neurons. Each cell receives electrochemical signals through its dendrites, filters those signals, and then selectively passes along its own signals (or spikes). To computationally compare biological and artificial neurons, the team asked: How big of an artificial neural network would it take to simulate the behavior of a single biological neuron? First, they built a model of a biological neuron (in this case, a pyramidal neuron from a rat’s cortex). The model used some 10,000 differential equations to simulate how and when the neuron would translate a series of input signals into a spike of its own. They then fed inputs into their simulated neuron, recorded the outputs, and trained deep learning algorithms on all the data. Their goal? Find the algorithm that could most accurately approximate the model. (Video: A model of a pyramidal neuron (left) receives signals through its dendritic branches. In this case, the signals provoke three spikes.) They increased the number of layers in the algorithm until it was 99 percent accurate at predicting the simulated neuron’s output given a set of inputs. The sweet spot was at least five layers but no more than eight, or around 1,000 artificial neurons per biological neuron. The deep learning algorithm was much simpler than the original model—but still quite complex. From where does this complexity arise? As it turns out, it’s mostly due to a type of chemical receptor in dendrites—the NMDA ion channel—and the branching of dendrites in space. “Take away one of those things, and a neuron turns [into] a simple device,” lead author David Beniaguev tweeted in 2019 , describing an earlier version of the work published as a preprint. Indeed, after removing these features, the team found they could match the simplified biological model with but a single-layer deep learning algorithm. A Moving Benchmark It’s tempting to extrapolate the team’s results to estimate the computational complexity of the whole brain. But we’re nowhere near such a measure. For one, it’s possible the team didn’t find the most efficient algorithm. It’s common for the the developer community to rapidly improve upon the first version of an advanced deep learning algorithm. Given the intensive iteration in the study, the team is confident in the results, but they also released the model, data, and algorithm to the scientific community to see if anyone could do better. Also, the model neuron is from a rat’s brain, as opposed to a human’s, and it’s only one type of brain cell. Further, the study is comparing a model to a model—there is, as of yet, no way to make a direct comparison to a physical neuron in the brain. It’s entirely possible the real thing is more, not less, complex. Still, the team believes their work can push neuroscience and AI forward. In the former case, the study is further evidence dendrites are complicated critters worthy of more attention. In the latter, it may lead to radical new algorithmic architectures. Idan Segev, a coauthor on the paper, suggests engineers should try replacing the simple artificial neurons in today’s algorithms with a mini five-layer network simulating a biological neuron. “We call for the replacement of the deep network technology to make it closer to how the brain works by replacing each simple unit in the deep network today with a unit that represents a neuron, which is already—on its own—deep,” Segev said. Whether so much added complexity would pay off is uncertain. Experts debate how much of the brain’s detail algorithms need to capture to achieve similar or better results. But it’s hard to argue with millions of years of evolutionary experimentation. So far, following the brain’s blueprint has been a rewarding strategy. And if this work is any indication, future neural networks may well dwarf today’s in size and complexity. Image Credit: NICHD/S.

But scientists and doctors are warning of a third wave of Covid and this time it may be nastier variants. The spirit of devotion is running high but in socially distant times rather than participate in crowded physical festival celebrations, it may be best to sign up for god dotcom. We could upload our prayers and live-stream our consciousness. Many of us already chant Om Googleshwar Namah on a daily basis. Last year, Durga Pujas took the lead in cyber ceremonies with video aartis and conch shell sounds transmitted via headphones. Metaphysically speaking, if the infinite is to be perceived by the human senses, what better way than tuning into cyberspace to experience cosmic waves? Artificial intelligence and supercomputers are in any case being hailed as the gods of the future. Instead of jostling in jam-packed temples, where coronavirus lies in wait, if the gods go online we may gain much better divine connectivity. Video gamers are already playing God games but for the truly pious, excellent broadband could provide high-speed blessings. A divine download could be the best way to clean up our hard disks. In times of Zoom rituals and Skype havans, many of us are karma yogis of the keyboard and when it comes to the steady flow of virtual devotion, we Indians don’t need a UPS. Quipped the internet wag: Computers already have in-built RAM. The Maharashtra government had given instructions that citizens are permitted only online darshan during Ganesh Chaturthi this year. Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal celebrated Ganesh Chaturthi via a live streamed puja. Why not? Well-loved Ganesh has always been the god of the Indian workforce. If Ganesh images can be painted on taxis and trawlers, why can’t Ganpati Bappa come to life in our home computers? Ganesh is part of the software of our daily lives. Websites like smartpuja dotcom show that to find the sacred we must increasingly be smart. In times of climate fragility, too many teeming pilgrimages to pristine locales could bring on unforeseen natural calamities. For planetary health, as well as spiritual succour, there could be nothing better than logging on to the Almighty. God is dead, proclaimed the philosopher Nietzsche. Not if you have good quality 4G, we could argue.

Shutterstock Sarah Sloat 9.12.2021 2:00 PM What if you were approached outside an insurance office by a cognitive scientist offering you $5 to answer this question: “ Can a beetle feel love?” Your answer may depend on a constellation of influences. You may think of the last time you squashed a beetle and felt bad about it. Or maybe, you think of the invasive beetle that’s infested your backyard. It may be a gut reaction: Of course beetles feel love. Of course they don’t. Kara Weisman is part of a research team who asked people around the world this question, along with others like: Do ghosts get hungry? Are robots deserving of moral treatment? When these answers are pooled, Weisman looks for patterns that inform similarities, and differences in our mental lives. A mental life consists of the thoughts, feelings, and intentions we attribute to others, animals, and inanimate objects. It’s a concept we employ to sort social and moral obligations. In a study released in August in the journal Nature , Weisman and colleagues interviewed adults and children living across the United States, Ghana, Thailand, China, and the South Pacific island country of Vanuatu. The interview subjects overwhelmingly conceptualize a mind-body distinction within the framework of mental life. This is sometimes called “mind-body dualism” and it refers to thinking of cognitive abilities as different from bodily sensations. “It looks like there’s some real flexibility in the human mind.” But the research team also came across significant differences in the way people across the world categorize socio-emotional capabilities. These differences, the scientists say, may “lead different groups of people to different conclusions about human nature, about why humans do bad things and how society should react, whether to fear or embrace artificial intelligence, and how to interact with any supernatural beings we believe to exist.” The differences in cultural ideas also offer opportunities, Weisman tells me. How the discovery was made — This study was part of Stanford University’s Mind and Spirit Project , an academic collaboration that combines the disciplines of anthropology and experimental psychology. It was an effort to “think about how people understand their minds and how that affects their spiritual and religious experiences,” Weisman explains. It’s also an extension of the work Weisman was doing for her dissertation at the time. She’s interested in folk philosophy — how people process, explain, and predict the behavior of others. The study team observed a significant amount of variability when assessing how people categorize social-emotional abilities. Weisman et. al. “I was kind of steeped in these sorts of classical questions and trying to figure out ways to understand how ordinary people, non-philosophers, think about the deep things,” she says. While conducting preliminary research in the United States, Weisman realized seemingly simple, and purposefully child-like questions (“do chickens ever feel sad?”) allowed her to probe the heavy topics without having to ask intimidating questions about the relationship between the mind and body. “We can use those kinds of lightweight, easy-breezy answers to infer these deeper philosophical ideas that I’m interested in,” she says of her method. This work informed the “bottom-up approach” the team took to the study. When interviewing U.S. adults, the responses were grouped into three categories: Bodily sensations related to biological means (“get hungry,” “feel pain”) Basic emotions and social abilities (“feel sad,” “feel proud”) Perceptual-cognitive abilities (“remember things”) These are summed up as the categories heart, body, and mind. And they became launching points for evaluating responses from around the world — although the team emphasizes that “comparisons with US adults are a tool for interpretation, not an assumption of our analyses.” “This was saying OK, I’m going to throw a whole bunch of questions at people and then I’m going to look at how they’re correlated,’” Weisman says. “In other words, when people say a robot can feel happy, what else do they think robots can do? These groups of correlated questions sort of coalesced into the heart, body, and mind framework.” Insights into mental life The five field sites were chosen to capture a range of religious traditions and “a variety of cultural models of the mind.” Adults were recruited in public places, like a bus station, and asked for five minutes of their time. Children were primarily recruited through elementary schools. “I think this could be useful in managing your own emotions.” While anthropologists and cultural psychologists have long argued we don’t all understand mental life in the same way, one primary similarity emerged: this distinction between physiological sensations and cognitive abilities, or the body and mind. “In the most basic sense, what we really demonstrate here is that sometimes people attribute hunger and pain and other bodily things to a being, let’s say a chicken, without attributing anything in the way of cognition and memory to the chicken,” Weisman explains. “And sometimes people attribute cognitive abilities without attributing anything in the way of those bodily abilities.” “It’s a really strong intuition that bodies are bodies and they’re in the physical world and minds, or souls, are different in that they are kind of not totally in the physical world,” she adds. Where differences really emerged was in the matter of “heart,” or socio-emotional abilities. For example, participants in the United States, Thailand, and China recognized “heart” abilities as a third, distinct category. However, there was no clear analog for “heart” across adult participants from Ghana and Vanuatu. In Ghana, for example, emotional statements like “feel love” or “feel proud” — statements that defined “heart” for U.S. participants — were observed as more “mind-like.” Meanwhile, in Vanuatu, “feel proud” was associated with physiological sensation, and “feel happy” was associated with cognitive abilities. These variations emerge for a number of reasons, including cultural differences in the value of exposing inner feelings publicly to varying interpretations of certain emotions as positive or negative states, and speaks to “the co-evolution of social systems, moral values, and emotions across cultural settings.” How to use this information — These findings point to two especially salient points: There are aspects of the human experience that all humans access to or can relate to There are aspects of our experience and our thinking where are different, and this is why different people come to different conclusions about the same things “There’s a lot of variability in how different people understand emotions — and there’s opportunity there,” Weisman says. “It looks like there’s some real flexibility in the human mind, for how we relate to and understand our emotional lives, and how they fit into the rest of our lives.” Having multiple ways of understanding emotions suggests people also have multiple ways of understanding their world. “I think this could be useful in managing your own emotions,” she adds.”If the way you usually think about your emotions isn’t serving you, this study suggests there are other ways of thinking about your emotions, and those could perhaps serve you better.” In the abstract, these findings help pave the way toward understanding why people feel differently about human-like entities, like animals and robots. How you process emotions influences what mental life you give to others, and in turn, the value you dispense.

(Connor D. Wolf/Transport Topics) [Stay on top of transportation news: Get TTNews in your inbox .] CLEVELAND — Decisiv announced an automated encoding system for fleets using Vehicle Maintenance Reporting Standards. The announcement was made Sept. 12 at American Trucking Associations’ 2021 Technology & Maintenance Council Fall Meeting and Transportation Technology Exhibition. The VMRS Encoding for Fleets analyzes individual service operations using machine learning and artificial intelligence to interpret information captured during the creation of a repair order, and assigns appropriate VMRS codes to completed operations. “VMRS coding, while it’s extremely valuable and a lot of insights can be derived from the data when it’s coded, the reality is on the service-provider level, something like 15% of service operations that come across our platform are actually VMRS-coded,” Decisiv CEO Dick Hyatt said. “That presents challenges.” TMC develops and licenses VMRS codes to improve trucking-related repair. “So then through this kind of cleansing tool, we then now have structured data,” Hyatt said. “So then it becomes now useful and something of value. This is all about what value can we deliver, what insights can we deliver to our constituents here across the board and in particular the fleets.” RoadSigns · Roadsigns E66 (Preview) Fleet managers find that healthy, happy drivers are key to business success. Stephen Kane of Rolling Strong says driver health starts with “being vulnerable enough to listen to somebody that knows about health.” Hear a snippet above, and get the full program by going to RoadSigns.TTNews.com . Decisiv said that the encoding takes place independently after the actual repair and maintenance operation. That way, fleets using Decisiv’s Service Relationship Management solutions can save time and money by eliminating the administrative effort and cost required to manually apply VMRS codes. Fleets have the option of receiving the data on a biweekly or monthly basis in a standardized file. Decisiv said the new solution further builds upon on its partnership with TMC announced earlier this year. The partnership was formed to produce service-event benchmark reports that will track key performance indicators based on the VMRS system. VMRS encoding also is part of Decisiv’s new SRM Discovery family of analytics products and reporting services. Want more news?

The court found that a police officer may record a police response in someone’s home using a body camera. But the police cannot then use that footage for an unrelated investigation without a warrant. Get the Daily Download Our news roundup delivered every weekday. Email * “The home is not a place to which the public has access, or where an individual might expect a recording made during a lawful police visit would be preserved indefinitely, accessed without restriction, and reviewed at will for reasons unrelated to the purposes of the police visit,” wrote Justice Dalila Wendlandt on behalf of the court in a 35-page opinion. The decision came in the case Commonwealth v. Abdirahaman Yusuf. The Boston Police Department responded to a call about a domestic disturbance at Yusuf’s home, and an officer wearing a body camera filmed the home during the police response. The footage was then uploaded to a Boston police database. The Boston police’s gang unit at the time was conducting an unrelated investigation into Yusuf for firearms offenses. A detective seeking a basis to gain a search warrant for Yusuf’s home viewed the footage from the domestic disturbance call, compared that footage to another video of Yusuf holding a firearm, and identified the location where he had the firearm based on the presence of distinctive curtains. The detective obtained a search warrant, found a weapon, and arrested Yusuf on firearms charges. Because the use of body cameras is relatively new in Massachusetts, there have been few regulations or legal precedent established to govern their use. The SJC ruling addressed two issues. The first was the question of whether video taken in a home by a body camera amounts to an unlawful search of the house. In that case, the SJC ruled that it does not. As long as the officer is legally present in the home and only does what is necessary to respond to the call, having the body camera footage is no different than having a police officer see something that is in plain view. However, the court then found that the Boston police acted improperly in allowing the gang unit to review the footage for an unrelated investigation. While the initial taking of the footage was justified, Wendlandt wrote, “this subsequent review for investigatory and unrelated reasons cannot be justified as a limited extension of the officer’s plain view observations.” Wendlandt wrote that the reason for allowing body cameras is to protect the police from false allegations of damage, promote police accountability, and serve as a record of police-civilian interactions. But there are also legitimate concerns that the cameras will be used as an invasion of privacy. She said allowing a police officer to comb through footage seeking evidence of crimes unrelated to the reason an officer was called to a home is the equivalent of a “general warrant,” a long-ago British practice of letting the police rummage through a home seeking evidence of a crime, which the Constitution’s prohibition against an illegal search was meant to address. Allowing officers to review the footage to investigate an unrelated crime, she wrote, “is divorced from protecting police officers from false accusations of misconduct, ensuring police accountability, or preserving a record of police-civilian interaction.” Amid national allegations of police misconduct, the use of police body cameras has been growing both in Massachusetts and around the country. With that have come growing calls for regulation of the cameras and their footage. A bill that would have developed a statewide code for the use of body cameras was introduced in 2019. A major criminal justice reform bill that was signed into law by Gov. Charlie Baker on December 31, 2020, created a task force to study body camera regulations. But so far the Legislature has not passed any regulations.

Kade Crockford, the technology for liberty program director at the ACLU of Massachusetts, said the agency welcomes the decision that police cannot store and “trawl” around body camera footage without obtaining a warrant. “Digital technologies like body-worn cameras grant government agencies vast new powers to collect, analyze, and process information about us,” Crockford said in a statement. “When combined with limitless data storage and machine learning-driven analytical tools, the stakes are raised even higher.

Learn more Home News Raspberry Pi Stops Pests from Ravaging Fruit Orchards By Ash Hill 12 September 2021 Researchers are using Raspberry Pis to automate pest control for fruit orchard farmers. Comments (0) (Image credit: University of Trento) Protecting fruit orchards from dangerous pests has been the focus as of late for researchers at the University of Trento . The team is relying on the Raspberry Pi to implement a custom machine learning (ML) platform capable of detecting dangerous pests for farmers before the infestation escalates to dangerous levels. To tackle the issue, they developed solar-powered, pheromone-based smart traps to lure bugs inside. The Raspberry Pi then captures an image for evaluation to determine whether or not too many unwanted bugs are present. In this case, the team has trained their system to detect Codling Moths with a custom model but it would be possible to train the platform to look for other bugs using another model. According to the paper published by the University of Trento research team, a Raspberry Pi 4 was considered for its notably higher processing power. However, the team ultimately chose to use an undisclosed Raspberry Pi 3 model as it operates with lower average power consumption. (Image credit: University of Trento) The smart traps are built using the Raspberry Pi, a camera module, a solar power system, a long-range radio chip and an Intel Neural Compute module to help with machine learning. A demonstration of the process identifies Codling Moths against acceptable bugs by highlighting them with a red box. This data is used to track current pest levels and can be used to trigger notifications to farmers when the population gets too high. This is one of the best Raspberry Pi projects we’ve ever seen for pest control and it’s exciting to see so many Raspberry Pis used on a large scale. To get a closer look at how the system works and what went into its creation, check out the full research paper from the University of Trento.

So in the past there were two VMRS licenses,"" TMC's Poster says. ""There are now four.” (John Sommers II for Transport Topics) [Stay on top of transportation news: Get TTNews in your inbox .] CLEVELAND — The Technology & Maintenance Council of American Trucking Associations on Sept. 12 announced a series of updates to its vehicle maintenance coding system, which it offers to service professionals in the trucking industry. The Vehicle Maintenance Reporting Standards for a long time had two licensing categories. TMC has now added two categories and moved the systems to an annual subscription. The announcement was made during the TMC Fall Meeting & Transportation Technology Exhibition. “The biggest news we have to tell you is after so many years, we have updated the VMRS licensing, and we’ve updated the VMRS implementation handbook,” said Jack Poster, VMRS services manager for TMC. “The powers that be pre-COVID decided we needed to redo the licensing to broaden the scope of VMRS. So in the past there were two VMRS licenses. There are now four.” Be sure to stop by the TMC products booth #15 at #TMCFall21 ! TMC's VMRS Services Manager Jack Poster will be there answering any questions you might have about VMRS! pic.twitter.com/2TbLhcjbq1 — Technology & Maintenance Council (TMC) of ATA (@TMC4Trucks) September 8, 2021 The VMRS system already had Corporate Complete for anyone using the codes on a daily basis and Complete Distribution for software management companies. The codes were updated to include the Electronic Catalog and Complete Development categories. “It’s an annual subscription,” Poster said. “That’s something else that’s changed. The price is based on sales and annual revenues. So that’s another change that we’ve made. We’re doing it sort of like ATA does its membership. “It’s based on your sales and your revenue. To date, we’ve had quite a bit of interest. It’s fascinating to me, the people that are coming on board using VMRS. It’s really changed over the years.” The Electronic Catalog covers components and manufacturing, and is meant for parts manufacturers, distributors or suppliers that want to code parts or their inventory. The Complete Development was introduced for companies and entrepreneurs that are working in areas such as artificial intelligence and using VMRS to gather the data. TMC first announced that it planned to update the codes during the TMC Spring Meeting in April. Want more news?

Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Advertisement Traditional owners across Australia’s Top End are tapping into space-age technology to round up and manage the feral cattle herds which roam across their vast, remote country. Feral cattle and buffaloes churn up wetlands, destroy native habitat, erode gullies, damage rivers and, on the east of Cape York, send damaging sediment into the waters of the Great Barrier Reef. Feral buffalo wreak vast damage on nature in the top end and millions are being invested to curb their impacts. Traditional owners want to know where the herds are and where they will go next, so they can either round them up and sell, or cull them where appropriate, to protect country and cultural sites. Mimal Land Management Aboriginal Corporation, Cape York Indigenous organisation Aak Puul Ngangtam and Normanby Land management are partnering with CSIRO and Microsoft as well as Darwin and James Cook University to develop new technology. Loading In a program dubbed Space Cows, feral buffaloes and cattle will be tracked across a 22,000 square kilometre area, taking in the Arafura swamp catchment in Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory, and Upper Normanby and Archer River on Queensland’s Cape York peninsula. The aim is to create a “digital twin of the landscape” using GPS tagged animals, satellite and weather data. Combined with Microsoft’s Azure Artificial Intelligence platform. Animals aren’t just tracked across the landscape, traditional owners will be able to see where they will go depending on changes in the climate and weather. For example, they could get early warning that a herd of buffaloes will hoof it to a particular wetland when the weather is forecast to be hot and dry, enabling traditional owners to round them up or cull them before damage is done to landscape. Advertisement CSIRO research scientist Andrew Hoskins said locating feral animals in remote and inaccessible terrain is often the biggest challenge. “We’re trying to put this next generation artificial visual intelligence and predictive analytical capability in the hands of rangers to give them the ability to manage the landscape and feral animals how they want to,” Dr Hoskins said. North Australian Indigenous Land and Sea Management Alliance chief executive Ricky Archer said Indigenous peoples’ longstanding links with the northern livestock industry were shifting towards caring for country. “There is strong interest in sustainable economic opportunities across these sectors,” Mr Archer said. “There is an ongoing challenge to balance the cultural, environmental, and economic outcomes for people on country. Feral cattle are an economic resource for traditional owners, as well as a source of damage to their country and cultural sites. Credit: Seth Seden “To make informed decisions we need to have the best data. To get the best data we need to use appropriate technology. We envisage a wave of digital transformation of the Indigenous land and sea management sector, but this must be driven by Indigenous practitioners in partnership with leading organisations and agencies.” Head ranger and traditional owner at Normanby Station in Cape York, Vince Harrigan, said he is expecting new technology to complement traditional cultural management practices and create opportunities for young people to learn new skills. “The project gives us the latest technology to help with land management and tracking cattle, but also provides training with drones and tablets, which is a big thing for our mob, especially the younger ones,” Mr Harrigan said.

Close Jan Goldman Commentary: Is it moral to let computer algorithms kill Afghans? Or anyone? By Jan Goldman Sep 12, 2021 Sep 12, 2021 Jan Goldman Subscribe today for $4 for 4 months On the campus of CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, is a statue of Nathan Hale. Hale was executed by the British during the Revolutionary War and is memorialized as the first American spy to die for this country. Below his statue are the immortal words, “I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country.” In July, one of his descendants, Daniel Hale, was sentenced to almost four years in prison for spying against the United States. Hale, a defense contractor, said he was compelled to leak classified information to “dispel the lie that drone warfare keeps us safe, that our lives are worth more than theirs (the enemy).” Specifically, Hale was morally repulsed by drone warfare and the unaccountable nature of using technology to kill without regret. He may be right, up to a point. Some members of Congress have called on President Joe Biden to grant Hale a pardon. He pleaded guilty to violating the Espionage Act for leaking classified documents to the media. Hale said he felt compelled to speak out after realizing he had helped kill Afghan civilians, including a small child. One document he leaked showed that during a five-month operation in Afghanistan nearly 90% of the people killed were not the intended targets. Over the years, the intersection of technology and man’s ability to kill has been playing out, with little or no debate on the morality of such action. We mustn’t become people who seek retribution at all costs, regardless of obtaining our objectives. It was not until World War II that we could create massive deaths, and the United States remains the only country to use nuclear warfare against an enemy. President Harry Truman detonated two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan, killing an estimated 300,000 people in the explosions. Truman said he never lost any sleep over the bombings because he believed it shortened the war and reduced the number of further killings. More recently, from a drone operations center made chiefly of plywood in the middle of the Helmand desert in southern Afghanistan, some of the world’s most sophisticated technology was aimed against Taliban fighters armed primarily with rifles. According to one U.S. drone operator, he directed more than 250 airstrikes resulting in 304 Taliban members killed and 54 wounded in nine months. What comes with technologically induced massive strikes are unintended consequences — the “collateral damage” when civilians become victims of a planned military strike. Slowly we are moving into an era where intelligence is not about substance, but rather a sense turned into algorithms digestible by computers. Recently in Libya, dozens of small drones, similar to those used by hobbyists, began divebombing trucks and soldiers, exploding on contact, causing panic and confusion. Strongman Khalifa Hifter’s soldiers retreated from Turkish-backed forces of the United Nations-recognized Libyan government. The drones were operated without human control as they hunted down Hifter’s fleeing soldiers.

Today, efforts to enact a total ban on lethal autonomous weapons, long demanded by human rights activists, are supported by 30 countries. But the world’s leading military powers insist that isn’t necessary. The United States and Russia say concerns are overblown, and humans can effectively control autonomous weapons, and accurate artificial intelligence weapon systems are still far into the future. Meanwhile, the United States, China and Russia are meeting to discuss a treaty limiting autonomous weapons, as all three countries race to develop them. However, European lawmakers recently proposed strict new rules regulating the use of algorithms for surveillance since studies have shown facial recognition for these programs is better at identifying white faces than non-white ones. For Daniel Hale, the intrusion and expansion of technology in warfare were too much to tolerate, and he decided to expose them to the media. And this is where he made a mistake. As a government employee with a security clearance, he was entrusted with the nation’s secrets. He had a legal and moral obligation to keep that trust, and he was wrong to leak the documents to the media. We tend to view this as a legal issue, not a moral issue. But the moral perspective is important. Informed citizens need to be able to discuss the implications and unintended consequences of artificial intelligence and technology with the ability to kill from afar, yet there is little public discussion over these weapons as they move into the mainstream. These are not theoretical concepts, given that we are likely to be militarily engaged in Afghanistan without troops on the ground, as we pull them from harm’s way. Nathan Hale likely would agree that people should not be losing their lives based on the miscalculation of a computer chip.

Commercial Radio Australia (CRA) says the new multimillion dollar hybrid measurement system comes in response to the rapid digitisation of audio consumption in Australia. Radio360 will begin to adopt the use of e-diaries for most of its surveys. It will also integrate livestreaming data to provide more information on the size and profile of audiences listening across digital platforms. A panel of 2,000 consumers will also be asked to wear an electronic watch meter that will detect when the wearer is in listening range of a radio broadcast and will provide encrypted anonymised information, to be used to validate and ensure the streaming data is accurate and deduplicated. CRA will partner with global research firm GfK to roll out the new system in measured stages, commencing in late 2021 and accelerating through 2022. “After consultation with key industry stakeholders, in recognition of the changing behaviour of our growing digital audiences and the need to accurately capture and report on this increasing consumption, the industry has moved forward with GfK in developing a hybrid measurement system,” says CRA chair and Southern Cross Austereo CEO Grant Blackley. “Australians are increasingly consuming radio through digital platforms. More than 2.7 million people are listening to radio each week through their smartphones. The industry’s investment in a hybrid measurement system will allow advertisers to connect to known, targeted audiences at scale.” The system will begin integrating streaming audiences in early 2022 using wearable device technology. Panels of 400 consumers in each of the five metro markets will be asked to wear watch meters to calibrate, validate and ensure de-duplicated streaming data. Streaming data will then be integrated with broadcast audience data, accredited via Gold Standard radio analysis software, and made available as part of regular ratings reports. The move is part of an ongoing review and modernisation of radio ratings being undertaken by CRA in partnership with GfK. “GfK is excited to partner with CRA to make hybrid radio audience measurement a reality following a rigorous and thorough testing and development period,” says GfK managing director for Australia and New Zealand Dr Morten Boyer. “Australia is one of the strongest radio markets in the world and the first to embrace this exciting approach, both from a methodological and data science perspective.” As part of the process, the transition away from paper diaries to e-diaries will continue this year. The proportion of survey respondents using an e-diary will be steadily increased from Survey 6, 2021, making the system more resilient to disruptions such as COVID, while maintaining the annual sample size at 60,000. “The overhaul of the radio ratings will future-proof the system and better capture listening everywhere, on every device,” says CRA CEO Joan Warner. “Digitisation and innovation adopted across the radio sector have removed any limitations to listening – radio is now genuinely ubiquitous, and we need a measurement system capable of capturing that. “By putting the right technology and methodology in place, we are ensuring that we are able to do justice to the full scale and opportunity of our audience in the eyes of advertisers, now and into the future.” Have something to say on this?

(“BioXcel” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: BTAI), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company utilizing artificial intelligence approaches to develop transformative medicines in neuroscience and immuno-oncology, today announced that updates from its ongoing Phase 1b/2 trial of BXCL701, the Company's investigational, oral innate immunity activator, in aggressive forms of prostate cancer will be presented in a poster session at the 2021 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress, which will take place virtually from September 16-21, 2021. POSTER PRESENTATION DETAILS Title: BXCL701 — 1 st -in-class oral activator of systemic innate immunity — combined with pembrolizumab, in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC): Phase 2 results Poster Session: Genitourinary Tumors, Prostate Time: Available starting on September 15 at 6:05 PM EST Poster Number: 610P The abstracts are currently available on the ESMO website at www.esmo.org . At the start of the poster sessions, the poster will be available in the “News & Media” section of the Company’s website at www.bioxceltherapeutics.com . About BXCL701 BXCL701 is an investigational orally administered innate immune activator designed to initiate inflammation in the tumor microenvironment. Approved and experimental immunotherapies often struggle to address cancers that appear “cold” or uninflamed.

Just because you can, does not mean you should: a warning that Conservative ministers would do well to heed as they look to sever European Union rules in the wake of Brexit. Government plans to scrap an EU rule guaranteeing human checks on decisions made by computer algorithms would not only remove a vital safeguard against inbuilt machine bias; it also risks adding, rather than cutting, burdens on business. The government wants to create a “data dividend” to boost innovation, with artificial intelligence among the sectors to be nurtured. It is understandable that the government feels pressure to show Brexit’s benefits — and there are areas where the UK could jettison Brussels rules in its favour — but cutting key protections of the EU’s general data protection regulation, as mooted in a consultation unveiled on Friday , is not the right way forward. GDPR’s Article 22 guarantees a human review of algorithms’ decisions, in areas as sensitive as loan provision or recruitment. Abandoning it would be foolhardy. Coming after lamentable — and now shelved — plans to harvest patient information from GP surgeries, the proposals are another assault on individuals’ data rights by a government emboldened by the pandemic’s necessary trade-offs around information sharing. It would also make the UK an outlier when even countries such as China — and indeed technology companies themselves — are moving towards greater human oversight of algorithmic decision-making. The UK is also looking at scrapping cookie warnings; pop-ups that inform internet users they are being tracked by advertisers. Cookie notices may be annoying but they are not, as the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, claimed, “pointless” , as they allow users to decline tracking. Far neater is the suggestion by Elizabeth Denham, the information commissioner, that users set preferences once on their browser. That, however, would require global co-operation. In all, the proposals risk creating more, not less, hassle: if rules on personal data diverge too wildly from the EU’s, the bloc could revoke a February agreement to allow continued information flows across the Channel, which would be disastrous for businesses. In any case, for UK companies doing any kind of business in the EU, having a separate domestic regime to comply with seems onerous, not innovative.

Similar issues are playing out in financial services, where a lack of an access agreement means that politicians, regulators and the City of London are divided as to how far the UK should diverge from EU rules. So far, tinkering is at the edges, focusing on insurance rules called Solvency II. A bloc-wide insurance regime was always too blunt for the idiosyncrasies of domestic markets but even the EU is reviewing it. Part of the rules, known as the risk margin, which insurers complain makes them hold too much capital when interest-rates are low, look like they will be recalibrated but the Bank of England is wary of letting insurers free up a big chunk of capital. Both industry and regulators agree on scrapping the EU banker bonus cap . Bankers obviously hate it and UK watchdogs are dubious because they feel it drives up fixed pay and removes discretion to withhold most remuneration in the event of wrongdoing. But conversely, this is one area the government will not touch. Arguing for abandoning limits on banker bonuses would be politically toxic, particularly in “blue wall” constituencies. It seems with bonuses, ministers seem content to do nothing, even though they could do something: an EU rule worth jettisoning that even Brexit cannot banish. This article has been amended to reflect the fact that the UK government is looking at scrapping cookie warnings, rather than cookie files.

AlphaGo is one such RL-based computer program that has defeated a professional human Go player, a breakthrough that experts feel was a decade ahead of its time. Reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning because it does not need the labelled input/output pairings for training or the explicit correction of sub-optimal actions. Instead, it investigates how intelligent agents should behave in a particular situation to maximize the concept of cumulative reward. This is a huge plus when working with real-world applications that don’t come with a tonne of highly curated observations. Furthermore, when confronted with a new circumstance, RL agents can acquire methods that allow them to behave even in an unclear and changing environment, relying on their best estimates at the proper action. Despite this advantage, many believe that it is inefficient because it is based on a trial-and-error process. However, researchers at Intel’s AI Lab has developed effective approaches for using RL for practical breakthroughs. They’re working on RL agents that can swiftly figure out challenging jobs and work in groups, placing the group’s general aim ahead of their own personal objectives. In RL, the tension between exploiting a current policy and exploring alternatives is crucial. RL agents have no way of knowing whether it is optimal at any particular time. As a result, it must choose between continuing to choose actions based on its present policy and deviating from it to explore new alternatives. It will never improve if it selects the former. The exploration rate is frequently set high at the start of training and gradually reduced as the agent gets expertise. Agents in Low-Reward Situations When an agent is functioning in a low-reward situation, the challenges become considerably larger. In this circumstance, the environment only offers a feedback signal, perhaps only at the end of a protracted multi-step process. As a result, the majority of the agent’s actions result in no useful feedback. Many researchers have used the Mujoco Humanoid benchmark created by OpenAI to assess RL bots’ performance in such difficult conditions. Researchers must teach a computer model of a 3D humanoid figure to walk for a set amount of time without falling in this experiment. While walking appears to be a simple activity, it is pretty difficult for an RL system to master. Intel’s AI team proposed a novel solution called CERL: Collaborative Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning to solve this problem. They break down this task into two components: small problems for which the system can receive rapid feedback and larger optimization problems that must be handled over a longer period. For the Mujoco Humanoid challenge, they had many learners working on smaller problems, including not falling over, raising a foot, among others. As they attempted to meet these tiny targets, the learners received rapid feedback. Each learner thus became an expert in their particular skill area, talents that may help them achieve the bigger goal of prolonged walking, even if they had no chance of achieving it on their own. What is unique about their design is that it allows all learners to contribute to and draw from a single buffer at the same time. Each learner had access to everyone else’s experiences, which aided its own exploration and made it significantly more efficient at its own task. The second group of agents, dubbed actors, was tasked with combining all of the little movements in order to achieve the broader goal of prolonged walking. Since these agents were rarely close enough to register a reward, the team used a genetic algorithm, a technique that simulates biological evolution through natural selection. Genetic algorithms start with possible solutions to a problem and utilize a fitness function to develop the best answer over time. They created a set of actors for each “generation,” each with a unique method for completing the walking job. They then graded them according to their performance, keeping the best and discarding the others. The following generation of actors was the survivors’ “offspring,” inheriting their policies. Their hybrid system quickly found an optimal policy that allowed the Mujoco Humanoid to go for a walk, outperforming other algorithms at the time. The Multi-Agent Problem While RL is difficult enough due to the scarcity of rewards, it becomes significantly more complicated when a job requires numerous agents to work together to attain a common goal. They chose the benchmark for simulated Mars rovers, in which two rovers must work together to identify many objects in the lowest amount of time. To tackle this difficult multi-agent task, the researchers extended their CERL framework and introduced Multiagent Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (MERL) . They used evolutionary search again this time. They made multiple duplicates of a whole rover team this time while working with teams. All of the Rover 1s and all of the Rover 2s and so on shared a single replay buffer. The replay buffers were purposefully split by rovers to allow each to focus on its own local learning. https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/artificial-intelligence/posts/introducing-merl.html The rovers were required to work together because each target was only counted once enough rovers had reached it. Locally optimized policies were inserted into the evolutionary search, just as they were in CERL, so that the best policies from the Rover 1s, Rover 2s, and so on could be tried out. Evolution simply had to cope with the overall strategy of the team. The team compared MERL’s performance to that of the MADDPG algorithm, another state-of-the-art system for multi-agent RL. They notice that their virtual robots were first tested on a smaller rover issue, in which only one rover must reach a target. It is found that MERL hit more targets than MADDPG, as well as some unusual team behaviour. MADDPG entirely failed when three rovers had to reach a goal at the same time, and MERL’s emergent team formation was even more visible, a tendency they noticed as the needed number of rovers increased. Intel’s research explored various multi-agent benchmarks, and the two-part optimization of MERL significantly beat existing state-of-the-art techniques in each case. The team is also looking into how communication might assist multi-agent systems in performing better. They’re specifically looking into whether agents on a team communicating with one another can form a kind of language. They’re also exploring ways to provide a common safety standard for diverse RL algorithms, as well as a framework for training RL agents to operate securely in any application. Because an abstracted concept of safety is difficult to establish, and a task-specific definition of safety is difficult to scale across activities, this is easier said than done. Today’s AI is good at things like object and speech recognition, but it’s not good at performing actions. Robots, self-driving automobiles, and other autonomous systems will benefit from RL training since it will teach them how to operate in a changing and unpredictable environment. They’re employing RL paired with search algorithms to teach robots how to construct successful trajectories with minimum interaction with the real world in one ongoing test of our theories. This method could allow robots to experiment with new actions without risking harming themselves. Finally, they are using the same methodology to improve many areas of software and hardware systems. Their recent study shows that an RL agent can learn how to manage memory on a hardware accelerator efficiently. By efficiently allocating chunks of data to various memory components, their technique, Evolutionary Graph RL, was able to virtually quadruple the speed of execution on hardware as compared to the native compiler. This achievement and other recent study findings demonstrate that RL is progressing from solving games to solving real-world problems.

In ordinary times, consumers prefer holding on to old habits, with a very slow adoption of new methods that require them to change the way they have been traditionally thinking or interacting. It especially holds true for the financial services sector, mostly life insurance, which has typically been a traditional product. However, the pandemic caused customers to change their behaviour – rapidly and in large numbers. Customers were forced to adopt newer ways of doing everyday activities, from grocery shopping to office work to online education for kids and even financial transactions, offering new experiences. Long-held beliefs When individuals are delighted by new ways, even long-held beliefs can change, making them more willing to repeat the behaviour, even when the trigger (in this case, the pandemic) is gradually easing out. The life insurance industry, too, experienced the same change and took some of its biggest leaps, in terms of digital, customer service and underwriting in the last one-and-a-half years. The next new normal will be all about focussing on these changing customer behaviours. The ‘everything digital’ customer Today, almost all age groups have begun to adopt a millennial mindset when it comes to digital. Speed and ease of transaction will be seen as key differentiator in the days ahead. There will be a need to enhance use of data and accelerate digitisation for heightened customer experience. Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, along with intelligent automation, will be the key source of better customer insights and, thereby, faster turnaround. This customer behaviour will force companies to transition out of legacy platforms and collaborate with ecosystem players to speed up their game, leading to enhanced customer experience and understanding. The ‘I need more’ customer The world witnessed a massive shift in the purchasing behaviour of customers – personalisation of every aspect of the customer experience. One-size-fits-all products will not appease customers in the next new normal. The customer will need adequate life insurance and would like to be covered for specific risks. Hyper-personalisation will take a leapfrog, and companies will have to focus on simple, innovative, and differentiated products to cater to policyholders’ emerging needs. This will lead to innovations in the space of protection and health-related covers. These solutions will be simple to understand, will have hybrid features or bundled offerings, and will be available across channels. Simplifying products and the insurance ecosystem so that the customer experience becomes less complex, more efficient, and more tailored, will lead to insurance offerings becoming bespoke, simpler and cheaper. The ‘experience-focussed customer Tomorrow’s customer will value life insurance providers who understand his/her needs well and keep customer engagement at the centrestage. Like other e-commerce platforms, the insurer should be able to predict customer needs in advance and advise them through proactive engagement, with a 360-degree view of the customer. Personalisation in terms of tailored solutions, service and even in language, will be a key differentiator, especially in a country like India. Quick response time, faster resolutions, and robust self-service capabilitieswill be the ask of the customer in the next new normal. Life insurers will have to strengthen their use of the decision engine or next-best-action technology to have relevant insights about their customers, carry out need-analysis and, thereby, suggest appropriate products in line with an individual’s needs and behaviour. The ‘omnipresent’ customer Customers today have become used to having access anytime, anywhere. They expect services to be available on their fingertips, wherever they are. Customer preference for easy process and digital channels will continue to be on the rise. There will be a critical need to expand service channels, providing more options to engage – physical branches, phone-based contact centres, chatbots, WhatsApp, Mobile Apps and social media. Phygital will be the way to go as this will also take care of the customers in Indian hinterlands who are still looking for physical access. This omni-channel, unified, and asynchronous messaging will help insurers engage with customers on their desired channel and at their preferred time. The ‘health-conscious’ customer Anything propagating health and wellness will enhance customer affinity in the future. The pandemic has resulted in an increase in proactive consciousness towards health, and customers will value companies that understand this evolving need. The future will see life insurers evolving as holistic protection partners. Life and health insurance companies will need to ride on each other’s expertise and work on combo solutions, which can be a one-stop-shop for the insurance needs of a customer. The proliferation of data and connected devices, particularly wearables, will continue to make it easier for life insurance companies to play an active role in shaping customer’s health – to everyone’s benefit. The industry might see several tie-ups with wellness partners to look at the complete wellbeing of their customers and, thereby, also reduce risks. A definite win-win for both customers and insurers. The experience of living through the pandemic has changed the way people live and behave. Changes which offered positive experiences will last longer, especially the ones driven by well-being, convenience, and simplicity. Thereby, digital adoption, value-based personalised purchasing, and increased health awareness will be the customer behaviours that will shape the next new normal. This will be a game-changer for the life insurance industry and provide an opportunity for the industry to think beyond the usual, innovate, and offer granular, value-based and integrated products to meet customer needs. The focus will be on insurance offerings, which will combine risk transfer with proactive and value-added services and emerge as a differentiator. It will be critical for insurers to stay relevant and adapt with the changing times. As the world begins its slow pivot from managing the Covid crisis to recovery, it’s clear that some of these shifts in behaviour will define the next new normal. It will change the way consumers behave, in some cases for years to come.

Wolf | Staff Reporter September 12, 2021 5:00 PM, EDT Decisiv Unveils Automatic VMRS Encoding Solution ""This is all about what value can we deliver, what insights can we deliver to our constituents here across the board and in particular the fleets,” Decisiv CEO Dick Hyatt says. (Connor D. Wolf/Transport Topics) [Stay on top of transportation news: Get TTNews in your inbox .] CLEVELAND — Decisiv announced an automated encoding system for fleets using Vehicle Maintenance Reporting Standards. The announcement was made Sept. 12 at American Trucking Associations’ 2021 Technology & Maintenance Council Fall Meeting and Transportation Technology Exhibition. The VMRS Encoding for Fleets analyzes individual service operations using machine learning and artificial intelligence to interpret information captured during the creation of a repair order, and assigns appropriate VMRS codes to completed operations. “VMRS coding, while it’s extremely valuable and a lot of insights can be derived from the data when it’s coded, the reality is on the service-provider level, something like 15% of service operations that come across our platform are actually VMRS-coded,” Decisiv CEO Dick Hyatt said. “That presents challenges.” TMC develops and licenses VMRS codes to improve trucking-related repair. “So then through this kind of cleansing tool, we then now have structured data,” Hyatt said. “So then it becomes now useful and something of value. This is all about what value can we deliver, what insights can we deliver to our constituents here across the board and in particular the fleets.” RoadSigns · Roadsigns E66 (Preview) Fleet managers find that healthy, happy drivers are key to business success. Stephen Kane of Rolling Strong says driver health starts with “being vulnerable enough to listen to somebody that knows about health.” Hear a snippet above, and get the full program by going to RoadSigns.TTNews.com . Decisiv said that the encoding takes place independently after the actual repair and maintenance operation. That way, fleets using Decisiv’s Service Relationship Management solutions can save time and money by eliminating the administrative effort and cost required to manually apply VMRS codes. Fleets have the option of receiving the data on a biweekly or monthly basis in a standardized file. Decisiv said the new solution further builds upon on its partnership with TMC announced earlier this year. The partnership was formed to produce service-event benchmark reports that will track key performance indicators based on the VMRS system. VMRS encoding also is part of Decisiv’s new SRM Discovery family of analytics products and reporting services. Want more news?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Cybersecurity 2021 Home AI By Sarah Hunt September 12, 2021 Organizations across industries are turning to artificial intelligence (AI) in cybersecurity to protect their networks and relieve often understaffed IT and security operations centers (SOCs). AI cybersecurity can provide network security from various angles, including: Application security Cloud security Endpoint security Overall network security Network traffic analysis (NTA) As a component of security incident and event management (SIEM) platforms This review of the AI in cybersecurity provides information about the state of the market, key growth drivers, the primary industries utilizing it, regional impacts, leading AI cybersecurity vendors, and typical use cases. AI in cybersecurity today Markets and Markets estimates the AI cybersecurity market will reach $38.2 billion by 2026, up from $8.8 billion in 2019 — a CAGR of 23.3%. Typical software offerings in the AI cybersecurity market include various features and options related to AI-based network monitoring, including application program interfaces (API) for language, speech, vision, and sensor data and machine learning (ML) algorithms. Key growth drivers Notable growth drivers in the AI cybersecurity market include the widespread increase in the adoption of Internet of Things (IoT), growth in the number of connected devices and increased awareness about the vulnerabilities inherent to Wi-Fi networks. As more organizations venture into the cloud computing realm, AI cybersecurity that functions within these environments will begin to take over more of the AI cybersecurity market share. Market and Markets also points to increased social media use for business functions as a prominent growth driver in this field. Primary industries AI cybersecurity usage is widespread, but a few prominent industries using this technology include: IT services Banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) Health care Telecommunications Manufacturing and supply chain Adoption by region North America currently holds the largest share of the AI cybersecurity market, according to Verified Market Research . Within North America, the U.S. market makes up the largest share, due to its significant presence in various fields, including: Banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) Government agencies Cloud computing Data regulatory compliance services While North America is anticipated to retain its majority share of the AI cybersecurity market, it’s important to note that the Asia Pacific (APAC) region is expected to become the fastest-growing region between 2019 and 2026. This is due to increasing internet adoption, a shift toward digitization of internal processes, and this region’s growing adoption of cloud-based services. Each of these areas can benefit from AI-enhanced cybersecurity solutions. Benefits of AI cybersecurity Organizations have myriad cybersecurity solution options, including AI-enhanced solutions that offer attractive benefits unavailable in traditional cybersecurity. For example: AI can gain knowledge over time. Platforms enhanced by machine learning and deep learning can adapt to the networks where they “live” by recognizing patterns. Once these platforms establish a baseline of expected network behavior, they can intelligently determine whether unexpected behavior poses a threat. AI is less error-prone and more efficient than human analysts. While humans will always be part of the cybersecurity equation, many processes related to network security can be automated and handled by AI, reducing input errors, speeding up security-related processes, and increasing the SOC’s ability to detect unknown threats. AI can monitor a more extensive scope than human security analysts. Even large SOCs are limited in their ability to examine every potential vulnerability, especially when there are dozens or hundreds of endpoints at play. Modern enterprises with mobile-connected workforces and IoT significantly benefit from turning over some of that oversight to AI. Another critical benefit has to do with the so-called AI arms race. Effectively, the theory goes, bad actors are already harnessing the power of AI to conduct network attacks — without equally powerful AI cybersecurity solutions, enterprises are highly vulnerable to sophisticated hacks, phishing, and other attacks. In its report, “Using AI for Evil: A Guide to How Cybercriminals Will Weaponize and Exploit AI to Attack Your Business,” the Forrester Research team writes, “There are already instances of threat actors and hackers using AI technologies to bolster their attacks and malware.” Enterprises face a never-ending race to beat them to the punch. AI cybersecurity use cases Apart from the typical use cases for any network security approach — safeguarding proprietary data and enterprise assets — cybersecurity that includes an AI component is especially well-suited for specific use cases, including: Fraud detection Unified threat management Within mobile device management (MDM) approaches, especially those that include BYOD mobile devices Streamlining security operations, including reducing the amount of repetitive and tedious work required of analysts AI cybersecurity vendors These 10 companies represent the majority of the AI cybersecurity market share.

(NASDAQ: ECHO) increased 52.3% in the previous trading session. This is why it happened. The stock price of Echo Global Logistics, Inc. (NASDAQ: ECHO) – a leading provider of technology-enabled transportation and supply chain management services – increased 52.3% in the previous trading session, going from a previous close of $31.32 to $47.70. Investors are responding to the company Echo Global Logistics announcing that it has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by funds managed by global private equity firm The Jordan Company, L.P. (TJC) for an equity value of approximately $1.3 billion. Through this deal, Echo will become a private company which it expects will provide additional resources and flexibility to continue to build its technology and data science platform and enhance its value proposition to shippers and carriers. Under the terms of the deal, Echo stockholders will receive $48.25 per share in cash — which represents a premium of approximately 54% over Echo’s closing share price on September 9, 2021, and a premium of approximately 32% over Echo’s all-time high closing share price on September 10, 2018. Going forward, Echo believes that the transaction provides its stockholders with an attractive premium that delivers immediate compelling value for their shares.

Send me a copy: https://mybs.in/2ZhROg3 (Book Cover) SYSTEM ERROR: Where Big Tech Went Wrong and How We Can Reboot ALSO READ Harvey Weinstein appeals rape conviction, blames 'cavalier' judge Finding opportunity How Big Tech is watching you Tuning into pain: How Begum Akhtar channeled her struggles into art Distilled wisdom from investment legends SYSTEM ERROR: Where Big Tech Went Wrong and How We Can Reboot Authors : Rob Reich, Mehran Sahami and Jeremy M. Weinstein Publisher : Harper/HarperCollins Price : $27.99 Pages : 319 Stop me if you’ve heard this one: A philosopher, a computer engineer and a government guy walk into a bar — and give us a very detailed and overwhelming college lecture about what we need to do about tech, its power and the damaging unintended (and, often, quite intended) consequences of its inventions. It’s a noble effort, but about halfway through this book by three Stanford professors, I felt as if maybe I were the one who needed a stiff drink, given the ceaseless onslaught of studies, factoids and examples of a far too broad swath of the problems that face our country and the world because of the growing hegemony of tech companies and their products. Don’t get me wrong, it’s critical that we make more connections between tech and the rest of our world, especially as it invades everything from politics to entertainment to communications to travel to, yes, how we fall in love. And it’s important to recognise how we’ve become twisted and angry and hopelessly addicted, due in part to the flood of malevolent information that flows over devices and gadgets that we cannot now live without. That was the impetus of the authors — Rob Reich, Mehran Sahami and Jeremy M. Weinstein — when they joined together at Stanford to create a multidisciplinary undergraduate course called “Ethics, Public Policy and Technological Change.” Its aim, as described by the school, is to “explore the ethical and social impact of technological innovation, marrying the humanities, social science and computer science” and from there “to bring about a fundamental shift in how students, whatever their choice of major and whatever their professional career pathway, think about their role as enablers and shapers of technological change in society.” Well, sign me up — except that in book form and not over a full semester, it becomes a laundry list of very weighty issues, each of which should be (and has been) the subject of its own book. These include, among other things: artificial intelligence, algorithms, facial recognition, self-driving cars, privacy, hate speech and the obvious corruption built into the venture system of capitalisation. Even Soylent, the drink invented to minimise the need to prepare food, makes an appearance. If that sounds like reading an action-packed syllabus, it is exactly like that, minus getting to hang on the lovely Palo Alto campus. Jamming all these topics into one book gives it a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it quality about the material, although for those not familiar, System Error certainly serves as a very well-written, if superficial, primer for all we need to know about the impact of the tech industry. Then again, maybe the authors should be applauded for their impulse to write the book at all, to the extent that it challenges readers to think beyond a one-note computer education that’s driven by efficiency and optimisation, without ethical rigor. Big Tech celebrates ad nauseam the ability to grow fast and scale endlessly rather than asking whether and how we should make some product in the first place. Understanding consequences and taking responsibility for their innovation is scarce in the industry, and that is exactly how the problem mutates to where we are. The authors — who are the ones teaching these wunderkinds — do understand that there needs to be some self-reflection, finding a medium somewhere between tech boosterism and the techlash. But in playing out the challenges, they provide only one short chapter about solutions, again like a checklist and far too light to let readers feel as if they can do much about the Silicon Valley freight train headed their way. When complex tech phrases like “blitzscaling,” “privacy paradox,” “OKRs” and “success disaster” whiz by, it’s hard to imagine doing anything about it but firing up the iPhone and doomscrolling Twitter. In other words, I’ll take that Soylentini now. ©2021TheNewYorkTimesNewsService Dear Reader, Business Standard has always strived hard to provide up-to-date information and commentary on developments that are of interest to you and have wider political and economic implications for the country and the world.

Premier Construction Premier Hospitality Rail Construction Premier Retail PC Channel Islands Premier Engineering Premier Construction Premier Hospitality Rail Construction Premier Retail PC Channel Islands Premier Engineering Industry News • Premier Rail Cordel & D/Gauge partnership delivers breakthrough automated intelligent gauging to UK railways 1 day ago by Amy Written by Amy The intelligent gauging solution is being showcased this week at Railtex Automated intelligent gauging has become a reality for railways in the UK with the launch of a partnership between leading AI and gauging providers Cordel and D/Gauge. Automated intelligent gauging combines the collection, categorisation, and interpretation of transport corridor data with the management, analysis and application of gauging data sets so that railways receive the most complete gauging information for all projects, plans and routes in their network. Cordel is a leader in the use of LiDAR and AI to collect and understand railway corridor data. Cordel’s railway-specialised machine learning engines provide the fastest and most accurate interpretation of gauging-relevant data points across a railway. Cordel is used by major railways in Japan, Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom. D/Gauge specialises in innovative, powerful, and accurate gauging algorithms, applicable to any gauging challenge, created from decades of research and data science. D/Gauge is relied upon by major railways across the UK. After collaborating on a successful project for Network Rail where Cordel’s technology and D/Gauge’s expertise came together, both companies are excited to be presenting a joint stand at this year’s Railtex / Infrarail event, 7-9 September in Birmingham, UK. Many railways are deploying LiDAR and cameras to collect terabytes of point cloud and imagery data, but they struggle to use this data to its full potential due to sheer volume, so a smarter way of interrogating point cloud data is needed. Cordel’s AI intelligently interprets railway point cloud data, normalising linear & GPS references and understanding the entire context of the corridor-wide detail to deliver accurately classified data for clearance and gauging purposes. D/Gauge’s fully cloud-based solution for gauging software ingests the classified data and delivers automatic gauging analysis and reporting, including dynamic clearances and high-wide projects, providing increased accessibility and gauging awareness across the network. This enables more revenue traffic, more efficient operations, and safer railways. Colin Johnson, Managing Director of D/Gauge said “We’re very pleased to be working with a forward-thinking company like Cordel. Our values are extremely similar, and this working relationship will allow us to increase our offering to more clients. With our gauging expertise and Cordel’s exceptional data automation, we can unlock more of our network, together.” Cordel CEO and Co-founder Nick Smith commented “We’re thrilled to be working with the team at D/Gauge. Colin and his team are experts in understanding survey data and using software to display accurate clearance distances.” Rebeka Sellick, Business Development Director at Cordel, commented “Innovative railways face data sharing and processing challenges. We can automate the critical data pipelines from train-borne sensor data collection, through AI processing to insights at the decision-maker’s desktop or handheld. Cordel has been hugely successful in other markets, and we’re excited to be enabling railways in the UK and Europe to benefit. Working with the specialists at D/Gauge provides an end-to-end automated and intelligent gauging solution that addresses the unique complexities of gauging across the UK rail networks.” Visit Cordel and D/Gauge at the Cordel stand G51 where Nick, Colin and their teams will be on hand to discuss the exciting innovations in AI and gauging software, including new features and upcoming releases.

It has served more than 400 clients till date (L-R) Qandle co-founder & CTO Himanshu Aggarwal with co-founder and CEO Chayan Mukhopadhyay Founded by Chayan Mukhopadhyay and Himanshu Aggarwal, Qandle distinguishes itself as a comprehensive solution and covers the entire gamut of HR activities—from hire to retire. It has leveraged technology to develop a modular and flexible solution for HRs looking to deliver the next-generation experience to the teams. The idea was first conceived by Mukhopadhyay. In his previous organisations, he had experienced the challenges of clunky HR solutions and how they are an irritant for the HR department and employees both. So when Mukhopadhyay decided to enter into the world of entrepreneurship, he started a company in the employee benefits space. However, when he interacted with HRs of different organisations while pitching the solution, he witnessed a grave need of HR management solution that is comprehensive, configurable and intuitive.

And then they started Qandle: an all-in-one HR platform—in 2016. The platform follows a SaaS based model and charges a subscription fee per employee per month. It offers an extensive array of modules supporting day-to-day HRMS functioning with refined execution on the backbone of AI, machine learning and predictive analytics. All the sweat and effort is proving fruitful for the brand. The startup raised $1,200,000 from investors—Arun Chandramohan and Redwood Internet Ventures in 2018. The startup has a strong portfolio of 400+ clients, with a major presence in NCR, Bangalore and Kolkata. The brand has names like Spinny, Airmeet, Chanel, Shadowfax, Camp K 12, Quality Control of India, Edureka, Shriram schools, TCNS Clothing, Vidyamandir Classes as its clients. Qandle has raised a total of $1,200,000 in 2018 in its first and only funding round. It is cash neutral for more than a year now, and continues to grow organically, adding 15-20 new corporations per month. Going forward, Mukhopadhyay says, “The short term goal is to double the client base by 2022. In addition, we are striving to continuously improve our product offering by introducing new innovations and modules to help the evolving landscape of work.” Get live Stock Prices from BSE , NSE , US Market and latest NAV, portfolio of Mutual Funds , Check out latest IPO News , Best Performing IPOs , calculate your tax by Income Tax Calculator , know market’s Top Gainers , Top Losers & Best Equity Funds .

File No prior information given on enhancement, say students Engineering fee in university colleges has been doubled this year from ₹ 18,000 to ₹ 35,000 for the traditional B.Tech courses and from ₹ 35,000 to ₹ 70,000 for the self-financed courses. Students were surprised to find the enhanced fee while filling up the web options as there was no intimation from the government. The officials, without making it public, uploaded the enhanced fee on the website. The new fee will be applicable to engineering and pharmacy courses. The increased fee will be applicable for JNTU Hyderabad campus college and also in the university colleges in Manthani, Sultanpur, Jagityal and Sircilla. The OU College of Engineering has also increased the fee while colleges in Kakatiya University and Mahatma Gandhi University have refrained from doing so. Fee for new courses has been increased enormously. For example students choosing the newly introduced course Computer Science Engineering (Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning) in OUCE will have to pay ₹ 1.20 lakh per annum. Fee for B.Tech (Mining Engineering) has been fixed at ₹ 1 lakh per annum. Students are baffled with the sudden increase without any information from the government. University officials claim that the government had given them permission in July itself to increase the fee and they took the decision after discussing in the Executive Council.

Take for instance, CoffeeMug, an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered 1:1 professional networking platform enabling seamless networking for professionals, investors, and business leaders in the startup ecosystem. Founded in February 2020 by Dipti Tandon, founder of Jeevansathi.com and Magicbricks, and Abhishek Sharma, a seasoned entrepreneur, this is a video-first global platform of senior professionals that helps them connect 1:1, virtually, or over coffee, thus building a powerful, long-lasting relationship. This Singapore-based firm has seen 50,000 people joining the platform within a few months of its inception. Currently, the platform is adding over 15,000 members every month to its community. “In my experience of over two decades while working in the internet economy, there is one thing that I have witnessed and experienced multiple times—meeting the right people at the right time can prove to be a massive game-changer in one’s professional journey,” says Sharma. “I also observed that there was a pattern to it. Most of these chance meetings happened one-on-one, mostly in an informal and easy-going setting like in a coffee shop or at someone’s place. Imagine, what if Jobs hadn’t met Wozniak? Apple wouldn’t have existed at all. This posed the question – ‘What if we could make this happen at a global scale?’, that’s how the idea of Coffee Mug was born,” he reveals. Related News Jet ready to take off in early 2022 Legacy dues to private gencos hit `49,000 crore Kotak fund invests Rs 1k cr in TVS supply chain entity to help buy out CDPQ’s stake CoffeeMug’s journey, so far, has shown a lot of promise. “So far, we have also set up over 1,20,000 meaningful 1:1 connections, with over 6000 members signing up for weekly meetings. We’re looking at a growth of over 25% month-of-month,” says Tandon. CoffeeMug plans to have more than 1,00,000 members by the end of this year. “While we’ve already established our presence in more than 70 cities across 10 countries, we want to become even more prominent on a global level in the coming year. We are planning to expand its base across South East Asia and the US by the end of this year,” says Sharma, adding, “We’ve also seen multiple case studies where our members found jobs, co-founders, raised money—– all on our platform. We first met our investors on CoffeeMug, so we are proud to say that we’ve personally tasted success through our platform.” CoffeeMug has raised $6,25,000 in its pre-seed round led by Paradigm Shift Capital and AngelList India. This funding round has seen participation from marquee angel investors in India, including Archana Priyadarshni, IIM Indore Alumni Angel Fund, Yagnesh Sanghrajka, and Alok Bajpai. “We plan to use these funds to accelerate the efforts to refine CoffeeMug’s AI-based matchmaking algorithm, double its existing user base of 50,000 globally, and connect the members with genuine business opportunities,” says Tandon. The two co-founders have a series of plans they wish to put into action. “We will continue to invest in our AI-based technology stack and refine our matchmaking algorithm to make it better and more targeted in the months to come.” By the end of this year, they aim to double the member base and have more than 100,000 members on the platform. “Even though we’re already present in over 10 countries, our target is to go global in the months to come. Plus, we want to unlock real business opportunities and ease the process of hiring, partnering, mentoring, and investing verticals for our members,” they inform.

We will see the unveiling of more powerful QCs over the next five years. How prepared is India to ride the quantum technology wave? Agencies This will have a cascading effect of seeding a vibrant quantum startup ecosystem leading to job-creation and economic growth. M S Santhanam M S Santhanam is professor of physics, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune Umakant D Rapol Umakant D Rapol is professor of physics, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune L V Subramaniam L V Subramaniam is senior manager, AI science, IBM Research India In July, the European Organisation for Nuclear Research ( Cern ) announced it would deploy quantum computers (QCs) to power its search for fundamental particles. Unlike a decade ago, QCs are no more tentative prototypes, but fast emerging as a viable tool for niche practical applications ranging from designing novel materials to enabling drug discovery. QCs are now available as a cloud-based service to anyone with an internet connection. We will see the unveiling of more powerful QCs over the next five years. How prepared is India to ride the quantum technology wave? Introduced as an idea by Nobel-winning physicist Richard Feynman in the early 1980s, QCs are not merely faster versions of the computers we use but are machines based on the laws of quantum physics. A typical QC hardware computes by manipulating electrons and nuclei using electromagnetic radiation from lasers. The technology is complex as precise control over these delicate manipulation schemes is necessary to perform calculations. If this technology can be mastered, QCs promise, at least for a certain class of problems, unprecedented computational speeds not attainable even by the fastest supercomputers available today. There are a few competing hardware platforms (ion traps, superconducting qubits, etc) for a QC without a clear winner yet. Even the software stack has not been standardised. The field remains wide open for innovations. India has a unique advantage — the ability to build on its existing strengths in theoretical and experimental quantum sciences. However, to make a significant impact, India must invest in building QCs, enhancing quantum technology skill sets and seed an industry ecosystem to utilise this technology. Barring a few premier institutions, quantum computing is not yet part of the curriculum in most Indian universities and colleges. This issue must be addressed through a programme to skill faculty, enabling them to teach engineering and science undergraduates. By 2024, India’s software developer community is expected to be the largest in the world. By training this community, India can create a quantum workforce for itself and the world. GoI and the industry must support interdisciplinary research and development in quantum science and technologies. As part of the National Mission on Quantum Technologies and Applications ( NM-QTA ), the 2020 budget had committed ₹8,000 crore. Also, a Technology Innovation Hub (TIH) for quantum technologies has been set up at Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune, focused on translating research into products and services. These investments must increase. At present, private investments are lacking. Industry and PSUs must be incentivised to evaluate and work on applications relevant to their domain. Quantum technologies include a whole gamut of interrelated technologies — quantum cryptography, quantum sensors, quantum materials, quantum meteorology, etc. Products based on quantum cryptography for secure communications are already available in the market. However, unambiguous evidence of societal benefits of QCs is still lacking. Demonstrating a few showcase applications is critical to persuade industry to invest in quantum technologies. These applications could be in drug discovery, logistics and optimisation, new materials, fintech, machine learning and defence. This will have a cascading effect of seeding a vibrant quantum startup ecosystem leading to job-creation and economic growth. India must build its own competitively sized QC in mission mode by pooling its existing academic expertise. A few indigenous QCs will give India a voice in shaping the future of quantum computing. With the right policy framework and incentives, India has the potential to become a key player in a global quantum technology market anticipated to reach $31.57 billion (₹2.32 lakh crore) by 2026. This will generate more technical jobs in the coming decades. India must move fast to respond to the fast-evolving quantum landscape.

Let us check out the key features and overall running. Trusted, secure and built to last— words that best describe mobile phones from Nokia, these days made by a company called HMD Global. This reviewer has reviewed a couple of smartphones from this Finnish firm in recent months; they are some of the best devices in the mid-range segment when it comes to getting great features, solid hardware, and frequent software updates, all at incredibly affordable prices. Take for instance, its brand new offering, Nokia C20 Plus. Available in Ocean Blue and Dark Grey colours, they come in 2/32GB and 3/32GB configurations at a best buy price of Rs 8,999 and Rs 9,999 respectively. There’s a 6.5-inch HD+ screen, two-day battery life for non-stop work and play, good build quality combined with a unique replacement guarantee offer for peace of mind. Let us check out the key features and overall running. Out of the box, the Nokia C20 Plus impresses with its pleasing looks; it is a blend of beauty and brawn. Backed by a one-year replacement guarantee, the C20 Plus is built from quality materials and houses a durable polycarbonate body that can stand up against life’s daily knocks. There’s also pretty decent power inside, solid battery life and a big screen with good resolution. My point is this phone has a lot going for it beyond its relatively low price.

Credit: © Mitchell Foster and Adele Doyle New TU Dresden research group aims to uncover how stem cells respond to mechanical forces and electrical cues during the development and maintenance of the nervous and cardiovascular system. Dr. Adele Doyle, Assistant Professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, USA, joined the Cluster of Excellence Physics of Life (PoL) in July, 2021, to lead the research group Mechanobiology of Stem Cells at TU Dresden. Using approaches from engineering, biology, and computer science, her group studies how molecular circuits enable specialized mechanosignaling. The interdisciplinary team investigates how stem cells learn to respond to mechanical forces and electrical cues during the development of the nervous and cardiovascular systems, and how biophysical cues affect health or disease. The Doyle group seeks quantitative insights to help design cell and regenerative medicine therapies for neural and vascular applications. The Doyle lab is hosted at the Center for Regenerative Therapies Dresden (CRTD) at TU Dresden, and the Center for Systems Biology Dresden (CSBD). Cells in living organisms are surrounded by physical cues, such as mechanical forces, material properties, electrical cues, and chemical signals. Depending on the function and surroundings of cells, they experience various material properties and mechanical force inputs at different magnitudes and dynamics. “The ability of cells to take reliable decisions based on local physical cues is essential during the development of an organism and to maintain health. During disease, the normal physical cues can change, or cells can lose the ability to respond appropriately to local physical cues. For example, in the case of cancer, changes in the stiffness of tissues lead to unwanted cell proliferation and movement. The way cells sense the physical properties of surroundings is called mechanosignaling, a process that is not yet well understood,” explains group leader Adele Doyle. Dr. Adele Doyle. Credit: © Magdalena Gonciarz The Doyle lab aims to help cell and regenerative medicine therapies become more standard care options for patients who suffer from debilitating, chronic diseases. The team’s expertise lays primarily in neural and cardiovascular systems, and they also focus on the needs of patients. “Ultimately, our goal is to translate our research to the clinical context, and incorporate the insights gained from basic science research into clinical therapy designs. We enjoy collaborating with many types of groups, including from academia, industry, and medicine, at different stages throughout this process,” says Dr. Doyle. To study how mechanosignaling impacts successful embryonic development and organism homeostasis, Adele Doyle and her research group design experimental methods to take more accurate and sensitive molecular measurements in living cells and develop novel computational tools to analyze experimental data to model how cells take decisions. They also collaborate with engineering and microfabrication groups to study how controlled physical inputs affect cell behavior, such as in the case of traumatic brain injury-like impacts. “Our research is at the interface between physical sciences, such as engineering and physics, natural sciences, like chemistry and biology, medicine, and computer science. We combine three main aspects: the technology development, the mechanobiology of stem cells and their progeny, and electrogenic signaling in the nervous and cardiovascular systems,” describes Dr. Doyle. “We aim to discover how physical cues trigger changes in cellular internal molecular circuits, and subsequently cell behavior, as well as to contribute as a bridge between disciplines. For example, we initiate collaborations to help apply tools from physics and biology to address unmet medical challenges, and use data science and computation to integrate and gain insight from a wide range of experimental data sets,” Dr. Doyle adds. To meet these needs, a smooth transfer of knowledge and expertise within and between research groups and institutes is crucial. The Cluster of Excellence Physics of Life (PoL) forms a network between disciplines and is dedicated to this type of collaborative research. At PoL, scientists are fostering an environment that supports research from basic science to applications. The research focus of Dr. Doyle is an ideal fit for this interdisciplinary Cluster of Excellence. With its many life sciences research institutes and vibrant industry landscape, Dresden offers ideal conditions for such endeavors. Adele Doyle accomplished her B.Sc. in Biomedical Engineering at the Washington University in St. Louis, USA. She received her Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology & Emory University, USA, in 2010. Afterward, she did her postdoctoral research at Harvard University, USA. Since 2013 Doyle worked as Assistant Researcher (PI) at the Neuroscience Research Institute and Lecturer at the Center for Bioengineering and since 2019 as Assistant Professor at the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of California Santa Barbara, USA. Since July 1, 2021, Adele Doyle leads the research group Mechanobiology of Stem Cells at the Cluster of Excellence Physics of Life at TU Dresden.

By: Shawndrea Thomas Posted at 3:16 PM, Sep 12, 2021 and last updated 2021-09-13 09:34:29-04 TUCSON, Ariz. (KGUN) — If you shop at Fry’s, Walmart or Lowe's you’ve seen them, stand-alone patrol cameras are taking up space in Tucson parking lots. ""They really wanted to show a presence in their parking lots where they were able to help their patrons feel safer and have a feeling of control in the parking lots,"" Lindsey said. Steve Lindsey with LiveView Technologies who installs the cameras says the self-contained patrol cam has become an extra set of eyes and security in Tucson parking lots. ""Some customers have seen upwards of a 60% drop in shrinkage in the stores, some have seen 30 percent. Within the parking lots themselves they’ve seen a dramatic change in behavior,” Lindsey said. Lindsey also says the cameras use artificial intelligence technology to determine if there’s a threat in the area. ""There’s sophisticated technology in there that’s able to analyze the scene that it’s looking at and can determine what those threats are. Then based on the threat level it will alert people to take notice of that area,” Lindsey said. According to LiveView Technologies, the units are solar powered with a cellular connection. ""We call them a rapid deployment solution. They can move them around and bring them up and tear them down very quickly,” Lindsey said. Camera watchers are typically on site to respond to situations; remote command centers contact police when needed. “That human can get in and in real time they can move the cameras. They can talk through the speakers they can interact with that location. They can do that anywhere in the globe,” Lindsey said. As for pricing, it depends on how long you subscribe to the service and your needs. The cameras are used at election polling sites, construction sites and businesses of all types and sizes across the country. ------- STAY IN TOUCH WITH US ANYTIME, ANYWHERE Download our free app for Roku, FireTV, AppleTV, Alexa, and mobile devices.

While previous studies estimated premature deaths from wildfires in a specific country or region, authors of a study published Wednesday in Lancet Planetary Health say this is the most comprehensive assessment to-date of global wildfire mortality. The findings come as the smoke from yet another season of record-breaking wildfires in the Northern Hemisphere impacts air quality hundreds of miles away from burn areas. “Policy makers and public health professionals should raise awareness of wildfire pollution to guide prompt public responses and take actions to reduce exposure,” write the study authors. The study authors first estimated daily fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) concentration using a combination of machine learning, ground measurements, weather conditions, and chemical transport models. They then cross-referenced those pollution levels with data on more than 65 million deaths from 2000-2016 across 749 cities in 43 countries to get city-specific death estimates from wildfires. They found that short-term exposure to wildfire PM 2.5 pollution caused, on average, 33,150 deaths a year in the countries looked at in the study, with an estimated 6,993 cardiovascular deaths and 3,503 respiratory-related deaths a year. Of the countries studied, Guatemala had the highest proportion of estimated deaths from wildfire smoke, followed by Thailand and Paraguay. The authors note that all the mortality data used in the study comes from cities, and that the study is not a comprehensive look at global mortality; for example, although wildfires have burned more than 40 million acres in Siberia this summer, no Russian cities were included in the study. Far-Reaching Impacts of Wildfires Lead author Yuming Guo, professor of global environmental health and biostatistics at Monash University, told EHN that he was surprised to see that citizens from certain countries that don’t have frequent wildfires, like France and Germany, were still harmed from wildfire smoke. PM 2.5 refers to particles that are 2.5 microns or smaller in diameter — for reference, a human hair is about 70 microns wide . Because of their small size, these fine particles can travel deep into the lungs, where they can damage airways and enter the bloodstream. Children, infants, older adults and people who already have heart and lung conditions are especially at-risk from PM 2.5 pollution. While wildfires are far from the only source of PM 2.5 pollution in cities, the study authors found that PM 2.5 exposure from wildfires was more deadly, and longer-lasting, than fine particle pollution from other urban sources. They suspect that’s in part because of the chemical makeup and smaller size of the particles in wildfire smoke. Wildfire smoke also contributes to suicide, diabetes, renal diseases, and other conditions, said Guo. The study authors suggest that future research should look at the mortality data by age, sex, and other factors to better understand who is most vulnerable. Climate change is worsening wildfires by making wildfire-prone parts of the world, like California and Australia, hotter and drier.

To read the full article, simply click here to claim your deal and get access to all exclusive Business Insider PRIME content. Insider Ali Ghodsi, the cofounder and CEO of Databricks. Databricks Databricks, Confluent, and MongoDB surged this summer in the private and public markets. All three companies built their businesses on open-source software, which they give away for free. Their success shows open source can thrive, even competing against Amazon's and Microsoft's clouds. See more stories on Insider's business page . It's been a blockbuster summer for the open-source-software companies Confluent, Databricks, and MongoDB. Confluent went public in June and now has a $15 billion market cap. Databricks announced that it raised $1.6 billion in funding at a $38 billion valuation in August. MongoDB's market cap surged to $32 billion this month - almost as much as the $34 billion price tag IBM paid to buy Red Hat , the open-source company that was an early pioneer of successfully commercializing the same code it gave away for free. All these companies started as open-source projects , or software that's free for anyone to use, download, or modify. And while giving away software may sound counterintuitive, the success of Confluent, Databricks, and MongoDB show that the model can provide the fuel for a company to take off - even in the era of Amazon's, Microsoft's, and Google's dominance of the cloud market and their combined resources and hold over developers. It should be said that open-source software is not a promise of business success, despite the triumphs of those companies. Firms such as Docker , Cloudera , and NPM (now a GitHub subsidiary) have all encountered turbulence that showcase the difficulties of turning even the most popular open-source projects into real challengers to the tech titans. At the same time, Joseph Jacks, the founder and general partner of OSS Capital, suggested that while Databricks, MongoDB, and Confluent all made smart moves with excellent market timing, open source was foundational to the success they're now enjoying. ""I think open source is fundamentally the best way to build infrastructure technology and, in particular, data-infrastructure technology,"" Jacks told Insider. And as the Greylock partner Jerry Chen laid out in a recent post , companies such as Confluent and Databricks are thriving in the gaps where cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, and Google Cloud aren't or haven't yet become entrenched. ""Successful open source projects like Spark or Kafka can be a strategic advantage because the project and related commercial companies come to market with a community of developers they can sell to,"" Chen recently told Forbes . ""More generally, looking for an advantage around go-to-market or distribution is key in competing with the big cloud."" Hugely valuable companies are being born from open source Databricks' business is based on the fast-growing Apache Spark data science project, which started out of a lab at the University of California, Berkeley. Confluent's founders built its technology using Apache Kafka, which started at LinkedIn, and MongoDB started as a database project of the same name. Dev Ittycheria, the CEO of MongoDB. MongoDB Releasing software as open source allows more people to use a technology and, importantly, increases its prominence: Big firms and individual developers alike turn to it not only because it's free but also because popular projects have thriving communities that are always improving the software. Integrating open-source code can dramatically speed up a software-development project, without sacrificing quality. ""Generally, if I'm a new IT-development person in a large bank, the first thing I do is go to open source and look at the things I could use, so I don't need to build any of that stuff,"" said Alfred Chuang, a general partner at Race Capital. These companies tend to rely on a business model called ""open core,"" which means that while the open-source component of their product remains free, it builds a paid version of the same software with enhanced customer support or additional features, aimed at large customers. This, in turn, helps make popular open-source projects palatable to even the biggest customers and provides companies such as Confluent and Databricks a route to success. ""Really, what we end up seeing is, if you can build a company that commands a lion's share of attention and go the managed-services route, the market is going to reward that,"" said Stephen O'Grady, a principal analyst at RedMonk. Open source can be a competitive advantage, but it also includes risks To Ali Ghodsi , Databricks' cofounder and CEO, open source is ""one of the main tenets"" of his company's strategy because it created a massive ecosystem of developers around the product that's hard to match. ""Millions and millions of people just use the open source, and it's hard for any other vendor to grab control of those communities and lead those communities,"" Ghodsi recently told Insider. It's also one of the startup's advantages over its $95 billion data-cloud rival Snowflake . ""If you have a proprietary piece of software like Snowflake, you don't have that community of open-source vendors, open-source adopters around it,"" he said. Databricks also employs a model where the companies that build software on its open source have ""connectors"" that increase the usage of Databricks via their mutual customers. ""If someone is using some partner software that's working directly with Databricks, that drives more credits on Databricks, and that grows our revenue,"" Ghodsi said. Still, cloud providers such as AWS have increasingly brought their power to bear on competing directly with open-source firms, offering their own commercial versions of free software such as Kafka - the same open-source technology that Confluent uses. Some firms , including Confluent and MongoDB , have moved away from a traditional, more permissive approach to open source in response, opting instead for new licenses that limit the way the software can be used . Jay Kreps, the cofounder and CEO of Confluent. Confluent Ultimately, while there are certainly unique challenges in selling free software - challenges that not all can meet - this new class of open-source tech giants shows that the market is real and lucrative for those who are able to rise to the demands of the moment. Jacks, the OSS Capital investor, said, ""With the last 15 years of developments in infrastructure software, it's been obvious to the world that the majority of really exciting tools and technologies that developers care about have come from the open-source ecosystem.""

But raw data consists of garbage, irregular and inconsistent values which lead to many difficulties. Dirty data will always yield inaccurate and worthless results even after analysis until it is cleaned up well. If the data is of low and unclean quality, then the decisions made by the organizations based on that data will be ineffective and incorrect. If the data is incorrect, outcomes and algorithms will always be unreliable, even though they may look correct. That is why data hygiene and data cleansing are critical to ensure that data integrity is maintained. In this article, we will be talking about two such methods that are used to improve the quality of data, Data Cleaning And Normalization and discuss how and why they are important. Table of Contents What is Data Cleaning? Methods For Data Cleaning What is Data Normalization? Methods for Data Normalization Cleaning and Normalization In Python Conclusion What is Data Cleaning? Data Cleaning is a critical aspect of the domain of data management. The data cleansing process involves reviewing all the data present within a database to either remove or update information that is incomplete, incorrect or duplicated and irrelevant. Data cleansing is just not simply about erasing the old information to make space for new data, but the process is about rather finding a way to maximize the dataset’s accuracy without necessarily tampering with the data available. Data Cleaning is the process of determining and correcting the wrong data. Organizations rely on data for most things but only a few properly address the data quality. Utilizing the effectiveness and use of data can tremendously increase the reliability and value of the brand.  Hence, Business enterprises have started giving more importance to data quality. Data Cleaning includes many more actions than just removing the data, the process also requires fixing wrong spellings and syntactical errors, correcting and filling of empty fields, and identifying duplicate records to name a few. Data cleaning is considered a foundational step for data science basics, as it plays an important role in an analytical process that helps uncover reliable answers. Improving the data quality through data cleaning can eliminate problems like expensive processing errors and incorrect invoices. Follow us on Google News>> Data quality is also very important as several pieces of data like customer information are always changing and evolving. Although there is no one such absolute way to describe the precise steps in the data cleaning process as the processes vary from dataset to dataset it plays an important part in deriving reliable answers. The crucial motive of data cleaning is to construct uniform and standardized data sets that enable the analytical tools and business intelligence easy access and help to perceive accurate data for each problem. Image Source Methods For Data Cleaning There are several techniques for producing reliable and hygienic data through data cleaning. Some of the data cleaning methods are as follows : The first and basic need in data cleaning is to remove the unwanted observations. This process includes removing duplicate or irrelevant observations. Irrelevant observations are ones that do not fit with the problem statement one is trying to solve. Making sure that the data is irrelevant and that you won’t need to clean it again is a great way to begin. Getting rid of unwanted outliers is another method because outliers can cause problems with certain models. Removing outliers will not only help with the model’s performance but also improve its accuracy. Although one should make sure that there is a legitimate reason to remove them. Small mistakes are often made when numbers are entered. If there are any mistakes present with the numbers being entered, it needs to be changed to actual readable data. All of the data presents will have to be converted so that the numbers are readable by the system. Data types should be uniform across all of the datasets. A string can’t be termed as numeric nor can a numeric be a boolean value. Correcting missing values is another important method that can’t be ignored. Knowing how to handle missing values will help keep the data clean. At times, there might be too many missing values present in a single column. For such occurrences, there might not be enough data to work with, so deleting the column may stand as the best option in such cases. There are also other different ways to impute missing data values in the dataset. This can be done by estimating what the missing data might just be and performing linear regression or median can help calculate this. Fixing the typos as a result of human error is important and one can fix typos through multiple algorithms and techniques. One of the methods can be to map the values and convert them into their correct spelling. Typos are essential to fix because models treat different values differently. Strings present in data rely a lot on their spellings and cases. What is Data Normalization? Normalization is the process of organizing data from a database. This includes processes like creating tables and establishing relationships between those tables according to the rules designed to protect the data as well as to make the database more flexible by eliminating the redundancy and inconsistency present. Data normalization is the method of organizing data to appear similar across all records and fields. Performing so always results in getting higher quality data. This process basically includes eliminating unstructured data and duplicates in order to ensure logical data storage. When data normalization is performed correctly a higher value of insights are generated. In machine learning, some feature values at times differ from others multiple times. The features with higher values will always dominate the learning process. However, it does not mean that those variables are more important to predict the outcome of the model. Data normalization transforms the multiscaled data all to the same scale. After normalization, all variables have a similar weightage on the model, hence improving the stability and performance of the learning algorithm. Normalization gives equal importance to each variable so that no single variable drives the model performance. It also prevents any issues created from database modifications such as insertions, deletions, and updates. For businesses to achieve further heights needs to regularly perform data normalization. It is one of the most important things that can be done to get rid of errors that make an analysis of data a complicated and difficult task. With normalization, an organization can make the most of its data as well as invest in data gathering at a greater, more efficient level. Methods for Data Normalization There are several methods for performing Data Normalization, few of the most popular techniques are as follows : The min-max normalization is the simplest of all methods as it converts floating-point feature values from their natural range into a standard range, usually between 0 and 1. It is a good choice when one knows the approximate upper and lower bounds on the data with few or no outliers and the data are approximately uniformly distributed across that range. Decimal place normalization can be done with data tables having numerical data types. By default, the algorithm places two digits after the decimal for normal comma-separated numbers. One can decide on how many decimals are required to scale this throughout the table. Z-score normalization is a methodology of normalizing the data and hence helps avoid the issue of outliers in the data. Here, μ is considered the mean value of the feature and σ is the standard deviation from the data points. If a value comes to be equal to the mean of all the values present, only then will it be normalized to 0. If it is below the mean value, it will be considered to be a negative number, and if it is above the mean value it will be termed as a positive number. The number of the negative and positives are determined by the standard deviation of the original feature. Cleaning and Normalization of Data In Python Using Python we can easily perform Data Cleaning and Normalization. Here I have tried to demonstrate an example using Python and Numpy, to demonstrate the difference between the general data and normalized data. import pandas as pd import numpy as np  from scipy import stats  from mlxtend.preprocessing import minmax_scaling  import seaborn as sns import matplotlib.pyplot as plt You might highly consider normalizing your data if you are going to implement a machine learning or statistical technique that comes with the assumption of your data being normally distributed. Some examples of these include linear regression, T-tests and Gaussian naive Bayes. Now let’s see what normalizing data looks like: See Also Developers Corner When to Use One-Hot Encoding in Deep Learning? normalized_data = stats.boxcox(original_data)  fig, ax=plt.subplots(1,2) sns.distplot(original_data, ax=ax[0]) ax[0].set_title(""Original Data"") sns.distplot(normalized_data[0], ax=ax[1]) ax[1].set_title(""Normalized data"") Output : We can notice that the shape of our data has changed. Before normalizing it was almost L-shaped, but after normalizing, it looks more like a bell-shaped curve. This helps us ensure that the data is now properly skewed and scaled! Conclusion As we have discussed, data cleaning and normalization each has their own importance to help ensure the quality of the data for analysis becomes up to the mark. Both these methods have their own benefits and different methodologies that are highly important, especially in generating higher accuracies from models. In this article, we understood what Data Cleaning and Normalization are, their importance and the various methods through which both can be implemented. We also saw a small example of data normalization and what difference it makes in aspects of data processing. I would encourage the reader to explore and try these methods by oneself to understand the importance and benefits. Happy Learning!

(“BioXcel” or the “Company”) (Nasdaq: BTAI), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company utilizing artificial intelligence approaches to develop transformative medicines in neuroscience and immuno-oncology, today announced that updates from its ongoing Phase 1b/2 trial of BXCL701, the Company's investigational, oral innate immunity activator, in aggressive forms of prostate cancer will be presented in a poster session at the 2021 European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress, which will take place virtually from September 16-21, 2021. POSTER PRESENTATION DETAILS Title: BXCL701 — 1 st -in-class oral activator of systemic innate immunity — combined with pembrolizumab, in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC): Phase 2 results Poster Session: Genitourinary Tumors, Prostate Time: Available starting on September 15 at 6:05 PM EST Poster Number: 610P The abstracts are currently available on the ESMO website at www.esmo.org . At the start of the poster sessions, the poster will be available in the “News & Media” section of the Company’s website at www.bioxceltherapeutics.com . About BXCL701 BXCL701 is an investigational orally administered innate immune activator designed to initiate inflammation in the tumor microenvironment. Approved and experimental immunotherapies often struggle to address cancers that appear “cold” or uninflamed. Therefore, BXCL701 may render “cold” tumors “hot,” making them more detectable by the adaptive immune system and thereby facilitating the development of a strong anti-cancer immune response. BioXcel’s preclinical data supports BXCL701’s synergy with both current checkpoint inhibitor-based therapies and emerging immunotherapies directed to activate T-cells, such as IL-2. BXCL701 is currently being developed as therapy for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer of adenocarcinoma and treatment emergent Neuroendocrine Prostate Cancer (tNEPC) phenotypes (both “cold” tumors) and other advanced solid cancers that are “hot” or have become resistant to checkpoint inhibitors. Story continues About BioXcel Therapeutics, Inc. BioXcel Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company utilizing artificial intelligence approaches to develop transformative medicines in neuroscience and immuno-oncology. BioXcel’s drug re-innovation approach leverages existing approved drugs and/or clinically validated product candidates together with big data and proprietary machine learning algorithms to identify new therapeutic indices. BioXcel’s two most advanced clinical development programs are BXCL501, an investigational, proprietary, orally dissolving thin film formulation of dexmedetomidine for the treatment of agitation associated with psychiatric and neurological disorders, and BXCL701, an investigational, orally administered, systemic innate immunity activator in development for the treatment of aggressive forms of prostate cancer and advanced solid tumors that are refractory or treatment naïve to checkpoint inhibitors.

One way to solve the debate about whether to build a future tank for 2030 or simply continue to upgrade the Abrams main battle tank, may simply be to do both. That may be the Army approach, as the service appears to both be massively upgrading its classic 70-ton main battle tank while also moving quickly to make a decision in 2023 on concepts for a new platform called the “Optionally Manned Tank.” Optionally Manned TankThe Optionally Manned Tank is now purely in a conceptual stage, as the Army Science Board and Ground Vehicle Systems Center are currently exploring the “realm of the possible” regarding what kinds of technologies, platforms and weapons might best contribute to a new generation of tank-like vehicles. “We are gathering information in the form of studies and technology maturation,” Maj. Gen. Ross Coffman, Director, Next Generation Combat Vehicle Cross Functional Team, Army Futures Command, said in an interview with The National Interest. Interestingly, while the actual tactical function and impact of the new platform is intended to generate an extremely lethal, survivable “tank-like” impact on the battlefield, the platform itself may not even look like a tank, Coffman said. “I have gone on record saying I don’t care if it’s a tank. I don’t care if it hovers and shoots lasers. It just needs to be able to go into the nastiest places on earth and fight and win, with the key component being survivability on the battlefield, This is all pre-decisional, but we want to generate as many options for the senior leaders so they can make an informed decision,” Coffman told me. Could there be some kind of future air-ground armored hovering attack platform? Able to fire lasers and rockets from the air at low altitudes before advancing on land? May seem a bit wild, but the sky is likely the limit when it comes to Army innovators, and places like the Army Research Lab and DARPA are bound to be exploring seemingly unimaginable technological possibilities. There are bound to be a wide array of options and contingencies now being explored, depending upon the perceived boundaries of emerging, next-generation technologies. Most likely, the new Optionally Manned Tank will be a lightweight, expeditionary and maneuverable ground vehicle. However, the principle quandary likely being entertained right now is whether something faster with less armor can actually be survivable enough to operate in heavy mechanized warfare in a manner comparable to or greater than the Abrams? If it cannot survive the kinds of attacks and incoming fire an Abrams is built for, will it have enough active protection? Long range sensors? Fire power range, reach and guidance technology? The course chosen by the Army will likely rely upon what kinds of answers there may be to these questions. U.S. Army M1A2 Abrams TankAn M1A2 Abrams tanks assigned to 1st Battalion, 66th Armor Regiment, 3rd Armored Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division, fires a 120mm Sabot tank round at a target during Gunnery Live Fire Qualifications at the Udairi Range Complex, Kuwait U.S. Army Nonetheless, the considerations point to the aforementioned possibility that perhaps a new optionally manned tank can complement and fight alongside a heavily armored tank, that is if there are not lightweight composites or any technical breakthrough sufficient to architect a lighter vehicle equivalent or superior to an Abrams in terms of survivability. Specifics related to these questions may not be available, for obvious and understandable security reasons, yet there is evidence in the Army current path forward, which is to both massively pursue Abrams upgrades and sustainment while concurrently pursuing a new tank-platform for the future. The answer may be both, based upon the evidence thus far. One significant idea bearing upon these kinds of evaluation relates to a concept described to me by Army Futures Command Commander Gen. John Murray, and that is that should unmanned technology sufficiently evolve to enable breakthrough levels of autonomy, a future tank might not need to be survivable as it will carry no soldiers. The technology for advanced algorithms needs to advance a bit more before new levels of autonomy are operational, Murray said, yet progress is underway and rapid progress continues to hit new breakthroughs on a regular basis. Also, certain kinds of autonomy are already here and demonstrating great promise in Army testing and experimentation. As far back as a year or two ago, Army Futures Command demonstrated that an armored robotic vehicle could “breach” an enemy tank ditch while soldiers themselves operated several hundred meters behind. U.S. Army Assault Breacher VehicleThe Assault Breacher Vehicle (ABV) is a highly mobile and heavily armored minefield and complex obstacle breaching system. U.S. Army The advantage here is extremely significant, as the most dangerous, high-risk and life-threatening circumstances can increasingly be handled by unmanned systems, freeing up human decision makers to make optimized decisions about improved methods of attack. Manned-Unmanned TeamingOnce a tank ditch is handled, crossed or removed as an impediment, or early rounds of incoming enemy fire are confronted, infantry and heavily armed manned vehicles can approach or “close with an enemy” with a much greater tactical advantage increasing the prospect for mission success. This does not mean, Murray suggested, that the unique attributes of human cognition will be replaced or unnecessary in any capacity, but rather than advanced, AI-enabled algorithms will increasingly be able to support long-range manned-unmanned teaming and information connectivity between manned vehicles and forward operating drones. Perhaps a manned Abrams will bring its heavy armor, survivability and firepower to war, while performing command and control operations and making decisions for an ultra high-tech future Optionally Manned Tank to fight alongside it. U.S. Army M1A2 Abrams TankThe M1A2 Abrams Tank on a training exercise at the National Training Center Fort Irwin, California U.S. Army This might make a lot of sense, as a robotic tank could move faster, deploy more easily and surge forward into incoming fire with no risk to soldiers. Yet the platform could be supported by human decision makers in a heavily armored tank operating nearby. Advances with the Abrams tank, for instance, might favor this kind of conceptual thinking, especially if a new generation of Forward Looking Infrared Sensors enable tanks to find, track and attack enemy targets at safe standoff distances before it is seen. Optimizing this kind of approach, which both Coffman and Murray have explained as both manned-unmanned teaming and even unmanned-unmanned teaming, requires a growing a sought after blending between attributes and functions unique to humans and tasks performed by computers in an exponentially superior fashion. Artificial Intelligence“We use artificial intelligence to reduce the cognitive burden on the human to allow the machine to do what it does best and allow humans to do what they do best on the battlefield. What is the essence of decision-making when it comes to assessing those items that are not exactly tangible? Where there is not a ones and zeros solution…and answers come through with experience and anticipation. Currently, humans are better at game theory than machines,” Coffman said. When it comes to aggregating incoming sensor data, discerning targets, performing real-time analytics, organizing threat data and making recommendations to human decision-makers in seconds, nothing can parallel AI-enabled systems. At the same time, as indicated by Coffman, less tangible or more subjective variables vital to warfare decision making go well beyond the capacity of 1s and 0s. There are many elements of decision making which, for instance, pertain to psychological nuances, emotional considerations regarding the level of risk to soldiers and interwoven factors such as how to respond to several new developments intersecting at once. In essence, there are circumstances wherein human reasoning and cognitive processes place humans in a much better position to make determinations. Warfare maneuvers involve degrees of risk taking, damage assessment possibilities and even some informed speculation which might create a need to make decisions which exceed or venture beyond the analytical capabilities of mathematically-oriented machines and advanced algorithms. “Currently humans are better at game theory than machines,” Coffman told me. These things considered, the fast-advancing capabilities of AI are staggering. For example, AI-enable systems can increasingly analyze a variety of variables all in relation to one another in seconds, drawing upon a seemingly limitless database of catalogued data. How might weather conditions inform or alter operational considerations? How does this relate to surrounding terrain? In past scenarios, which kinds of maneuvers or counterattack choices proved most effective against enemy attacks. An AI system is only as effective as its database, yet advanced algorithms are increasingly able to discern how things like weather, terrain, incoming enemy fire and past operations can all inform choices in a fast-evolving new situation…and this can be done in seconds. So the way this works is that optimal courses of action, based on instant, yet extensive and extremely sophisticated analysis, can be presented to human decision makers. In terms of how this might be applied, some of Coffman’s discussions about preparing for specific geographical or enemy conditions can be greatly informed by AI. Geographical specifics in places like Eastern Europe, for example, can be catalogued and analyzed in relation to an armored attack. Computer databases can aggregate, distill and analyze geographical conditions with a specific mind to how they may impact warfare maneuvers. Coffman explained that knowing the terrain in Eastern Europe, for example, could prove extremely useful. “We don’t play home games, so what is the terrain in Eastern Europe? What is the terrain of the Indo-Pacific? We have to have the required mobility to be in a position of advantage. We have to transit local roads and infrastructure,” he said. Abrams Battle Tank ModernizationWhat might all of this mean when it comes to the future of the Abrams tank? Has it reached the end of the line in terms of upgrade potential? The answer seems to be no, in large measure due to the series of aforementioned factors such as high-speed computing, long-range thermal sights, ammunition datalinks and perhaps most of all, the impact of AI-capable technologies. Apart from a few external design configurations related to things like the vehicle chassis, turret and 120mm cannon, today’s Abrams is an entirely new vehicle when compared with its inception, or even a few years ago. The existing v3 variant and fast-emerging v4, for example, introduce paradigm-changing technologies capable of impacting Abrams tactics to a substantial degree. The Abrams will operate with an ability to attack at longer ranges, control unmanned systems, integrate new generations of survivability-enhancing Active Protection Systems and gather, analyze and transmit targeting data and other vital information in seconds. This changes combat. For example, many likely remember reading about the now famous Gulf War tank battles which were in large measure won with advanced thermal sights. U.S. Army Abrams tanks were able to see and destroy Iraqi T-72s before they were seen themselves, allowing them to attack and hit enemy tanks without facing incoming attack. Advanced Abrams tanks take this kind of technology to yet a much greater, paradigm changing level in terms of range, image fidelity, an ability to track multiple targets at once and draw upon AI-enabled target analysis. Moving into the future, an Abrams will be able to possibly operate smaller, faster, armed robotic vehicles moving ahead to enemy contact, while receiving and analyzing real-time video feeds and data from overhead drones and even surveillance planes. Then, as was already demonstrated last year during the Army’s Project Convergence exercise, AI-empowered computer systems can instantly perform analyses to pair sensor-to-shooter and tell human decision-makers which weapon, counterattack or operational response is best suited to the specific conditions of a given combat circumstance. Perhaps there is a drone attack coming from an urban area or enemy infantry moving through a friendly population? An AI system would discern all of these variables, factor in weather, geography, potential impact to civilians and compare it against an established database. The computer database will not only be able to bounce new variables off of what has worked in the past for similar scenarios but, for example, potentially recommend a non-kinetic solution such as an EW system to jam a drone or laser to pinpoint approaching enemy vehicles to reduce explosive fragmentation and limit damage to civilians. A human decision maker can then be informed of an optimal method of attack, based upon a massively integrated, yet immediate computer analysis. All of this means platforms such as the Abrams, especially when upgraded with AI-capable systems, an ability to operate drones and an instant capacity to receive, aggregate and analyze incoming sensor data, can continue to bring an unparalleled advantage to the battlefield. These advantages for the Abrams are fortified by a large number of current and ongoing upgrades to the Abrams tank v3 and v4 variants. These include a number of things such as ammunition data link, auxiliary power units to support a huge increase in computing, electronics and on-board power, multi-purpose, programmable ammunition able to function as a High-Energy Anti-Tank round, sabo round, kinetic energy round or canister round as needed. This reduces the logistical footprint and massively increases lethality. This kind of tactical approach, performed by an Army AI system called Firestorm during Project Convergence, emerged due to the instant organization and analysis of data from mini-drones, satellites, ground vehicles, helicopters, large drones and even dismounted infantry … at one time. A decision making process made exponentially faster, reducing attack time from 20 mins to 20 secs, can give a strategic advantage to even a much smaller force,” Coffman explained. “You must possess the capability to fight outnumbered and achieve victory,” Coffman said. Coffman explained that all of these factors, investments and areas of technological focus pertain to specific calculations regarding potential enemy forces. “We cannot modernize to parity, we must modernize to overmatch. We must look at what our potential adversaries are investing in and then project what the capabilities will be,” he told me. Please note: This content carries a strict local market embargo.

As games and gaming platforms become more complex and drive more revenue, companies are under increasing pressure to deliver seamless yet secure customer experiences. Many are looking to continuous intelligence (CI) to help navigate matters and improve operations. However, challenges in the market may be keeping gaming organizations from stepping fully into the potential continuous intelligence has. Why gaming needs continuous intelligence Continuous intelligence is a machine-driven approach to harnessing the power of data for insights. It can process massive data inputs in real-time, placing organizations in a position to pivot quickly and scale as necessary. The gaming industry relies on cutting-edge technology to deliver fantastic customer experiences. That hasn’t changed from the very first Atari consoles, but the sheer number of machines, devices, and systems on the network has changed the rules for the industry. Gaming companies must account for this inconsistency without sacrificing a seamless experience to take full advantage of the market. Gaming also requires high-performance standards, no matter how many devices access the network. These market pressures require a different processing solution for gaming companies looking to distinguish themselves in a crowded market. See also: How Continuous Intelligence Cuts Through Complexity Challenges in the industry Gaming presents some unique challenges that traditional operating systems cannot address. Let’s explore some of the biggest issues facing the gaming industry today in terms of technological logistics. Lack of visibility: The gaming industry is fragmented, storing and deploying products across many different systems. Troubleshooting problems requires accessing a multitude of different logs. The industry needs a central command to solve issues quickly. Lack of scalable investigation: When problems happen, gaming can respond, but it often misses the “why” behind these disruptions. Gaming companies need tools that can leverage big data to uncover insights in minutes, not hours. Lack of pipeline support: Gaming companies operate on DevOps principles, requiring rapid updates and software release. Too much manual monitoring of these pipelines leads to wasted developer time and slower issue resolution. Lack of robust security: Gaming companies are entrusted with highly sensitive data. New game frameworks must operate from a security-first principle that maintains compliance without overly restricting game access. Lack of scalability: Games don’t operate with the same clear trajectory. Gaming companies experience bursts of unpredictable data ingest, and they need a solution that doesn’t penalize them. Continuous intelligence addresses these challenges by providing an intelligent pipeline for data analysis that speeds resolution time. It offers the kind of scalable solution gaming companies need to maintain a constant cycle of development and compliance without lags in gameplay. To implement CI in the gaming industry, companies need: Self-provisioning SaaS with low to no maintenance Algorithms for advanced analytics, i.e., machine learning models. Out of the box integrations for fast implementation Security first integrations for compliance ( GDPR , etc.) Flexible licensing Benefits of Continuous Intelligence CI offers several benefits for the overall customer experience—something gaming companies need to remain relevant. Seamless experiences: Centralizing monitoring and analysis ensure issues resolve quickly, and companies can execute updates without delay. Robust security: CI analysis finds security breaches faster with fewer false positives. Accelerate innovation: With machine learning support, developers can better push updates and new products on a faster timeline. Continuous monitoring: Automating monitoring removes complexity and facilitates the DevOps cycle for gaming. CI is foundational for gaming innovation Continuous intelligence facilities the ideals of the gaming industry in a complex, massive data-driven world. As companies struggle to balance privacy and security compliance with real-time updates and seamless customer experiences, continuous intelligence could be the path forward.

She notes that the unofficial numbers show close to 400 students living on campus and online enrollment down after an all-time high in fall 2020. Here's what she had to say in her recent greeting: ""Greetings from the University of Minnesota Crookston. We have many exciting things happening on campus as we welcome students, faculty and staff back. If you have visited campus over the past 2-3 weeks, I know that you have felt the renewed positive energy on campus as students are engaging in a more fully in-person collegiate experience. First Day Our first day of classes was Tuesday, August 24. First day enrollment, while unofficial until October, has fewer people on campus this year than last and online enrollment is also down from our all time high in fall 2020. However the decline mostly is due to lagging recruitment numbers because of the limitations COVID placed on in-person recruitment events and campus visits. We believe COVID and its impact on the economy is affecting student willingness and ability to enroll. We’ve got some exciting initiatives in the hopper that we think will help us to rebound. Some of these will start as soon as January. Do note, this is preliminary information. Official enrollment stats for all University of Minnesota campuses will be available in early October to account for late registrations and/or movement of students among colleges and campuses in the first weeks of the semester. The number of students choosing to live on campus is just shy of 400, with more students choosing to live on campus after their first year. Over the years we have had many regional students attending UMN Crookston while concurrently completing their high school degree. To-date we have a record-setting 74 PSEO students enrolled with increases seen in both on campus and online delivery of Post Secondary Enrollment Option (PSEO) credits. COVID-19 We continue to closely follow state and federal guidance, public health data, science, and accompanying trends, and the best advice of the University’s own medical and public health experts. We know that even here in Crookston, many people are looking for credible information about the Covid vaccines. I encourage you to visit the “Just the Vax Facts,” “Great Questions and Some Answers,“ and the “Why and Where FAQ“ web pages with information from Jacob Tolar, the Dean of the University of Minnesota Medical School and Vice President for Clinical Affairs. The University of Minnesota System requires compliance with the Vax 2.0 program for all students including those completing courses online and those living in other states and countries. We held a vaccination clinic on campus at the Wellness Center on Thursday, Sept. 2 with 37 people choosing to get their vaccines. The clinic was part of the commitment the University holds to the health and well-being of all our students. Students have until October 8 to complete a survey documenting that they are vaccinated.  The two exemptions are a medical exemption, which requires a doctor’s signature on a UMN form, or a sincerely held religious exemption, which requires a notarized signature by the student on a UMN form. As with our other required immunizations, we will place a registration hold on the account of any students who do not comply, and we will lift the hold as soon as they are in compliance. Employees are required to attest that they have received the COVID-19 vaccination or are testing on a regular basis if they have not received the immunization.  They must do this by September 17. Facial Covering Compliance The UMN facial covering policy requires that all students and employees properly wear a facial covering when indoors or in an enclosed space.

During the event, David Cieslak, Chief Data Scientist for Aunalytics, will discuss the use of natural language interface synthesis of SQL database queries leveraging the company’s new NL2SQL System. Natural language interface integration with database environments is a growing field that enables end users to interact with relational databases without technical database skills. These interfaces solve the problem of synthesizing SQL queries based on natural language input from the user. There are considerable research interests around the topic but there are few systems to date that are deployed on top of active enterprise data marts. At ECML-PKDD 2021, Aunalytics will introduce the NL2SQL system and present on data simulations that provide adaptive feedback for continuous model advancement. The architecture of the NL2SQL is built on WikiSQL data and research conducted by the data science team at Aunalytics. The company supports multiple scenarios using a unique table expansion process. The data simulation and the feedback loop help the model continuously adjust to linguistic variation introduced by the domain specific knowledge. “We are excited to explore this emerging area with the professionals attending ECML-PKDD 2021,” said David Cieslak, Chief Data Scientist, Aunalytics. “Advancements in natural language integration with today’s most widely deployed data marts is expected to improve business outcomes for financial institutions seeking next-level business intelligence.” The ECML-PKDD 2021 event is the premier European machine learning and data mining conference, building upon more than 19 years of successful events and conferences held across Europe.

You Can Use Artificial Intelligence Adobe Stock Smart machines are created with smart processes. That includes AI, digital twins, and AR. Rob Spiegel | Sep 13, 2021 As industrial machines are becoming more connected and flexible, the process of building and commissioning the machine is also getting smarter. Machines are built now using artificial intelligence, digital twins, and augmented reality. We caught up with Rahul Garg, VP of industrial machinery and mid-market program at Siemens Digital Industries Software. Garg explained the process of creating smart industrial machines using advanced technology. Related: 10 new machines answer food packaging demands Design News: Is artificial intelligence becoming a major factor in building industrial machines? Rahul Garg: When you think of AI, one of the key ingredients is real-time data. It takes a lot of data to improve the way you’re making decisions. If you think about a machine performing under certain conditions, those conditions don’t stay the same. Depending on the environment, the conditions can change. A spinning machine handling soft fabrics changes based on humidity and other environmental factors. Not all machines run in an air-conditioned environment, so being able to monitor the changes and using AI, helps you adapt to the variables. The weaving speed needs to change based on these factors so you don’t mess up the cloth. Maybe you need to stop and send a signal to the right person. You can build upon that and adjust your processes based on the data. So you find a way to gather the data and let AI make the decisions so your decisions will be more pragmatic and effective. Related: Machines Text and Tweet, Eliminates Need to Write Custom Code DN: Another aspect of AI is the digital twin. Are digital twins becoming more of a factor in building machines? Rahul Garg: We use a digital twin when we design machines. All of the things involved in designing the machine are supported by the digital twin. You don’t have to have a physical replica to create the machine. You can look at the digital twin to improve the machine or troubleshoot it. An executable digital twin with AI can demonstrate how the machine is supposed to operate. More and more decisions can be made on the machine by using a virtual replica. That helps us make a smart machine smarter. DN: How is cloud connectivity playing in building and monitoring machines? How does edge computing fit in? Rahul Garg: We use cloud solutions for the engineering and the design of the processes themselves. We saw a big jump in cloud use with COVID-19. The cloud made things more possible. The automation folks were connected in a cloud environment to do their engineering and manufacturing work. The equipment is running at the customer's site. That’s where the cloud becomes interesting. When you’re trying to get data from customers to do proactive maintenance, you need data that shows how the machine is performing. Without the could it would be hard to know that. Using the cloud is part of serving the customer better. Once the cloud process is started for IoT cloud-based analytics, they realize they need the ability to perform some computing right at the machine site itself. We have to figure out when we need the data to come back to us and when it’s not necessary. We have this whole edge solution for machine builders to manage the data coming from the machines. They need to monitor the machines, but they also need some of the decisions to be made right at the edge. DN: How about flexibility and agility? Do your customers seek solutions that allow them to change up quickly and easily? Companies that can deliver a customized machine most efficiently will be the most successful. But much of the content on the machine can be reused from other instances when you’re customizing it. This helps companies reduce their cost while still getting what they want. Modular subsystems and components can be changed and reconfigured to customize the machine. The approach of creating modular machines offers the necessary agility to get the machine changed quickly. If you don’t have the modular approach, you'll have to do more engineering. It will cost you more and it may not serve your customers. DN: How big a factor is customization? Are all solutions custom when it comes to machine building? Rahul Garg: It’s not only becoming a factor, it’s a way of doing business. We create payload machines for certain jobs. Some machines are sold to job shops doing business for other clients. In many cases, you need to tailor the machiner for specific tasks. You have to get the speed and performance right for the job. When you’re creating a potato-bagging machine, you can image potato chips in all different sizes while also creating the need for air. It’s all part of what gets programmed into the machine. It requires customization depending on how the customer wants to differentiate its production system. DN: Are augmented reality and virtual reality becoming major factors in training? Or are they minor elements? Rahul Garg: It’s important to know the difference between AR and VR. AR is getting more traction because of COVID-19. Engineers who needed to go to sites were not traveling. Foods needed to be bagged, and if there was a problem with the machine, and the machine is from Norway and it’s deployed in Brazil, the field engineer can’t travel. AR systems allowed the engineers to get the data on a real-time basis to do the maintenance and repair and solve customer problems. The field engineer at the home office using augmented reality can usually serve customers better than making a trip halfway around the world.

The personnel chosen by Mr. Biden for the committee will determine U.S. strategy on AI policy not only for the administration but also to shape AI competition with China and other adversaries for years to come. The federal government is recruiting candidates for the committee and submitted a formal call for nominations in the Federal Register last week. TOP STORIES Republican points to 'leaked' Biden call, accuses administration of 'manipulating' Taliban intel 'No SALT, no deal': Vulnerable Dems threaten revolt unless $3.5T bill cuts blue-states taxes CNN poll: America turns irate, glum “AI presents an enormous opportunity to tackle the biggest issues of our time, strengthen our technological competitiveness, and be an engine for growth in nearly every sector of the economy,” said Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo in a statement. “But we must be thoughtful, creative, and wise in how we address the challenges that accompany these new technologies. She said that approach “includes, but is not limited to, ensuring that President Biden’s comprehensive commitment to advancing equity and racial justice extends to our development and use of AI technology.” The idea for the committee was created in a proposal during then-President Trump’s tenure, but became law through Congress’ overriding Mr. Trump’s veto of a 2021 defense bill. The priorities and emphasis of the committee under Mr. Biden are likely to look different than under Mr. Trump. White House science adviser Eric Lander said new AI capabilities must be matched by the government’s ability to provide fairness. “We must be sure that these [artificial intelligence] advances are matched by similar progress in ensuring that AI is trustworthy, and that it ensures fairness and protections for civil rights,” said Mr. Lander in a statement. During the Trump administration, the federal government convened a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence authorized through a 2018 defense bill. The commission issued a final report earlier this year to Congress that recommended spending billions of taxpayer dollars to foster AI innovation. The commission, led by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, is set to expire later this year. The new committee set to be staffed by Mr. Biden promises to focus on a wider range of issues. According to the government’s notice in the federal register, the committee will be tasked with giving Mr. Biden guidance on such things as how to prepare the American workforce for the “integration of artificial intelligence systems across all sectors of the economy and society.” Nominations for personnel to serve on the committee must be submitted to the National Institute for Standards and Technology by 5 p.m. Eastern time on Oct. 25.

The predictive accuracy of the new tool was comparable to that of video analysis that uses motor tasks to detect Parkinson’s, pinpointing facial expressions as a potential digital, diagnostic biomarker of the disease. This type of biomarker could allow remote diagnosis without the need for personal interaction and extensive testing. This would be particularly relevant in situations such as a pandemic, in cases of reduced mobility, or in underdeveloped countries where few neurologists exist but most people have access to a phone with a camera, researchers noted. The study, “ Facial expressions can detect Parkinson’s disease: preliminary evidence from videos collected online ,” was published as a brief communication in the journal npj Digital Medicine . Parkinson’s-associated motor symptoms, such as tremors and muscular rigidity, affect facial muscle movements, leading to overall reduced facial expression, also known as facial masking or hypomimia. Recommended Reading April 22, 2021 Columns by Lori DePorter The Many Masks We Wear With Parkinson’s Disease An increasing number of studies suggest that reduced facial expressions may be an “extremely sensitive biomarker for [Parkinson’s disease], making it a promising tool for early diagnosis,” the researchers wrote. In addition, facial expression analysis is a non-invasive tool that only requires a webcam or a phone with a camera, in contrast to the expensive, non-scalable, wearable sensors currently used to analyze movements during motor tasks as digital biomarkers of Parkinson’s. Now, a team of researchers at the University of Rochester, New York, showed that analyses of facial micro-expressions using an AI tool can accurately detect Parkinson’s. The study involved the analysis of 1,812 videos, collected online through a web-based tool (Park test) , of 604 people (61 with Parkinson’s and 543 without the disease). In these videos, participants were asked to make three facial expressions — a smiling, disgusted, and surprised face — each followed by a neutral face. Participants’ mean age was 63.9 years, and most of them were white and living in the U.S. Patients with Parkinson’s had been living with a diagnosis of the disease for a mean of 8.4 years. Changes in muscle movements in each of the three facial expressions were objectively measured and computed in terms of nine action units, or micro-expressions. In agreement with previous research, the analysis showed that Parkinson’s patients had fewer facial muscle movements than people without the disease. This was particularly significant for three micro-expressions: raising cheeks and pulling the lip corner — typically observed when people smile — and lowering the brows, usually seen when people express a disgusted face. According to the team, “the smiling facial expression has the greatest potential in differentiating individuals with and without” Parkinson’s, the researchers wrote. The team then used these differences in micro-expressions to train a machine learning tool to distinguish between individuals with and without Parkinson’s. Machine learning is a form of AI that uses algorithms to analyze data, learn from its analyses, and then make a prediction about something. They found that their AI tool could correctly identify Parkinson’s patients based on their facial expressions with an accuracy of 95.6%, which is comparable to the 92% prediction accuracy reported for existing state-of-the-art video analysis that relies on limb movements. “We show that an algorithm’s ability to analyze the subtle characteristics of facial expressions, often invisible to a naked eye, adds significant new information to a neurologist,” the team wrote. As such, facial expressions, especially smiling, “may become a reliable biomarker for [Parkinson’s disease] detection,” they added. Recommended Reading March 22, 2021 News by Forest Ray PhD Facial Recognition Program IDs Parkinson’s Patients as Older, Expressionless This type of diagnostic biomarker does not require in-person examination and diagnosis, which may be “potentially transformative for patients need of remote diagnoses due to physical separation (e.g., due to COVID) or immobility,” the team wrote. In addition, “many underdeveloped areas and underrepresented populations can also benefit from such method that utilizes facial expressions without worrying about direct access to a neurologist,” the researchers added. They noted that in 23 African countries, the mean population per neurologist exceeds half a million, but about 75% of people in Africa have access to a mobile phone, and that similar situations exist in Asia and South America. Moreover, the authors hypothesized the potential value of an app, that, with the user’s permission, could automatically analyze the micro-expressions of the user’s smile (from a short video) and provide a referral in case there were signs of Parkinson’s risk.

Watch Out for These 5 Artificial Intelligence Problems in HR Artificial Intelligence (AI) can truly relieve some of the hiring and evaluation burdens of HR. But, there are several areas where it's just not ready to take the place of actual humans. By John Boitnott September 						13, 2021 Opinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own. You're reading Entrepreneur United States, an international franchise of Entrepreneur Media. Artificial intelligence (AI) might be the way of the future in tech, gaming and smart-device industries. When applied effectively, AI can save on human employment costs and, in some cases, can accomplish tasks even better than humans can. It would make sense for other industries to try to capitalize on AI’s efficiency , versatility and overall power, but for entrepreneurs, applying AI to human resources (HR) poses some challenges. Related: Hire Your Next Remote Team Member from One of These 20 U.S. Tech Hubs Understanding AI and the challenges it creates in HR departments HR professionals may want to put AI to use, at least partly because it can offer predictive analysis for recruiting. When a company is swamped with resumes, AI can scan resumes for those that best fit the skills and responsibilities required for that specific job. In this sense, AI can save HR teams days of sifting through resumes and cover letters. But applying AI to HR departments isn’t always that simple, and in many cases AI can create more challenges than the problems that it solves. Here are some of those issues, and how you can deal with them. 1. AI won’t understand your company like you or a recruiter can Although AI might help recruiters quickly scan through a pile of resumes, it lacks the global understanding of a company that recruiters possess. When hiring ideal employees, a recruiter researches a company and develops an understanding of that company’s positioning, direction within the market and even company culture. AI lacks that same understanding, so when it comes to identifying employees who might be a good fit given the wider global view of the company, AI technology falls short. AI also lacks the knowledge and intuition that recruiters develop from decades in their jobs. AI won’t necessarily spot important connections in an applicant’s past work that might hint that applicant could be an important candidate. For instance, a recruiter might see that an applicant has worked for a company that underwent rapid growth in the past. That could mean the applicant might be comfortable and flexible enough to grow with a quickly expanding startup. AI won’t make that same connection. Related: Could This Robot Actually Be Your Marketing Writer? The key here is to consider mixing these solutions, so you receive the benefits of both. For example, you can use AI to help candidates more easily send you their credentials (automatic web forms and the like), but use recruiters and your own experience to narrow down the applicants who may actually be the best fit. 2. You might miss out on hiring outliers Job applicants who don’t fit all of the strict hiring criteria a company has established might also be overlooked by HR. Some of these outliers could make a strong contribution to a company but might not get an interview because of AI technology used to screen resumes. Similarly, because AI lacks a human touch, it might approve resumes of applicants who meet all of the required criteria, but who still aren’t ideal applicants for a position. Although it’s smart to use AI to cast a wide net, watch the process closely to keep an eye out for certain characteristics that you want in a new hire. If necessary, schedule time for you and your team to personally assess any candidate if needed. Related: Nervous About Meeting Employees in Person for the First Time? Try These 5 Tips 3.  AI can’t account for human emotion When hiring, companies don’t base their decision-making process on only hard skills. Emotional and psychological traits are important, too, including ambition and passion. AI cannot currently monitor or evaluate human emotion, and it can’t account for how emotion affects human behavior. AI also cannot account for personalities and how emotion can affect teams. If tasked with finding a new team member to add to an existing team, AI can’t recognize the nuances of team dynamics and how personalities work together. That’s where you and the team come in. Because AI operates without the background understanding of complex human emotions, it makes for a flawed hiring and employee evaluation process. Use it sparingly for actual employee evaluation, and let team members do that themselves. 4. AI can’t ‘read’ people HR is a human-based, personal operation. AI can’t replace an individual manager’s unique viewpoint or ability to “read” people in person, whether they’re job applicants or current employees. Although companies might incorporate AI solutions into their business models, the technology isn’t ready to take over significant face-to-face responsibilities in an HR department just yet. As mentioned, the technology might be useful in resume screenings, but it needs to be monitored closely and can’t replace talent evaluators (no matter what Elon Musk's plans are).

AI lacks ethical responsibility Ethical responsibility is key for HR teams today, especially when it comes to hiring minorities, taking action after sexual assault and other hot-button issues. AI lacks the ethical responsibility that HR needs to uphold, and AI can unknowingly become biased , too. AI technology “learns” from the algorithms that it processes. If AI’s machine learning process is programmed by a human, it can take on the biases of its programmer, even though he or she might be unaware of their biases. With biased technology, a company’s talent acquisition process might unintentionally also be biased. If the hiring process is ever challenged or questioned, the technology cannot be held accountable for the bias, so HR leaders and the HR team need to take on ethical responsibility. In order to prevent or remedy these occurrences, HR pros have to communicate about such problems to company leadership and programmers. Then, different departments should work together to identify bias, and prevent it from influencing hiring processes. On another ethical note, if AI can replace a certain number of workers at a company, HR might face the challenging question of deciding which employees to let go. AI might save a company money, but replacing employees with technology can be a touchy ethical dilemma. Also, certain AI tech can help by actually picking which people to lay off. Discuss whether these types of solutions feel ethically right to you and your team or not. Just who will select the technology, who needs to be retrained or who might be fired in the end? Go carefully and thoughtfully as you deal with AI and how it affects all of these matters.

Using the AI software, all organizations, from large enterprises to small businesses and schools to health care providers, can fully verify, track and manage vaccinations to prevent, control and mitigate Covid-19 in the workplace. Employees of these institutions no longer need to fear Covid-19 and can now safely return to work and live life as it was meant to be. Even with tremendous progress in vaccinations, an unbiased examination of the data will reveal that there is still much reason to fear in the here and now. There are more weekly infections now than at any other time since the start of the pandemic, excepting the peak period of Dec and Jan. As travel and mask restrictions are removed, newer and more deadly strains are popping up. Studies based on scientific research have shown that no amount of hygiene theater or workplace re-engineering can fully prevent the airborne transmission of Covid-19, particularly in indoor spaces. There is certainly a risk of contagion indoors and the valid concerns of workers about workplace safety is not being heard. Below citations are from just two of many such studies: Study I: https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/71/9/2311/5867798 Study II: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-16/covid-is-airborne-scientists-say-now-authorities-think-so-too Qare Inc. saw this coming and put data/smarts to work. Qare's AI solution ASGARD™ automatically collects and processes consent-based employee health data from smart health cards to verify vaccination and track Covid-19 risk dynamically at each location with pinpoint accuracy. And prevention and control measures can be initiated in real-time with highly granular access control measures. Says Kate Beckett , an early Beta customer from a midsize business, ""It's the new silver bullet, the next best thing since the vaccine. So now, we can be sure of an infection free work environment, instead of merely wishing or hoping for one"". Just as President Joe Biden is unveiling new vaccine mandates to combat Covid-19 and save lives, Qare Inc. has come up with the perfect new advanced AI solution to implement it. Qare's ASGARD™ can verify, track, monitor and manage vaccinations automatically with a touch-free workflow as well as intelligently control risks and mitigate vulnerabilities. However, this tool was not opportunely conceived overnight, but is a product of meticulous research and development for well over a year. Details on how companies big and small can access and deploy these silver bullets in the raging war against Covid-19 can be found at https://qare.ai About Qare Inc.

Hollings director Raymond N. DuBois, M.D., Ph.D., will serve on the American Association for Cancer Research's new Cancer Prevention Working Group. Photo by Sarah Pack The American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) today announced the formation of its eighth and newest scientific working group. This working group will specifically be dedicated to supporting cancer prevention research. Raymond N. DuBois, M.D., Ph.D. , director of MUSC Hollings Cancer Center and dean of the College of Medicine at the Medical University of South Carolina, is one of the 28 members appointed to the group. A dedicated advocate for the promotion and support of cancer prevention, DuBois said he’s excited to serve on this working group as part of a prestigious team of members serving from across the nation, Canada and Europe. The mission of the AACR Cancer Prevention Working Group is to establish cancer prevention as a global priority through innovative science, integration of the latest technologies, improved levels of funding and delivery of effective public education and awareness strategies. “This is an important part of the mission of Hollings and of our Cancer Control Program. I applaud the formation of this group and the priority it sets in shifting more of the focus to cancer prevention,” said DuBois, who also serves as an editor-in-chief of the AACR Cancer Prevention Research journal. The AACR Cancer Prevention Working Group will provide a forum for communication and collaboration among basic, translational and clinical scientists; physicians, nurses and other health care providers; and cancer prevention experts in academia, industry and government. The members of the working group will work together to facilitate basic, translational and clinical transdisciplinary research aimed at promoting the understanding of cancer prevention science. The AACR Cancer Prevention Working Group will strive to accomplish its mission by: Fostering transdisciplinary approaches to the study of cancer prevention. Promoting the incorporation of molecular and biochemical concepts and techniques as well as novel data science tools into well-designed cancer prevention studies. Providing an ongoing forum for the scholarly discussion and development of effective approaches to the conduct and interpretation of cancer prevention studies. Fostering collaborations with individuals and with relevant AACR scientific working groups engaged in other scientific disciplines. Recommending scientific and educational programs that will serve to advance the field. Assisting with the professional advancement of early- and mid-career investigators engaged in cancer prevention research. Establishing a community of cancer prevention experts and additional individuals interested in advancing progress in cancer prevention. Margaret Foti, M.D., Ph.D., chief executive officer of the AACR, said that following the inception of the AACR’s Molecular Epidemiology Working Group in 1999, the number of their scientific working groups has continued to expand to meet the needs of the cancer research community. “We are now proud to announce this working group dedicated to the vital area of cancer prevention research. The field of cancer prevention has been an area richly supported by the AACR since the organization’s founding in 1907, with the leadership of several AACR past presidents. This new working group will ensure that the AACR remains at the leading edge of scientific advancements in cancer prevention, early detection and interception.” For a complete list of all the members of the working group, visit the AACR website .

Keeping these machines at peak health is critical as wear-and-tear is inevitable. However forecasting and predicting maintenance is not straight-forward and varies from one indutry to another. To effectively schedule maintenance, it is necessary to predict how a detected abnormal condition is likely to develop in the future. Only then can valuable insight into the probable future consequences be gained The hybrid approach being used by ABB combines machine learning (ML) models and Failure Modes and Effect Analysis (FMEA) to provide accurate information about actual asset health. Successful predictive maintenance requires a three-pronged process: • Condition monitoring that can provide early detection of faults • Identification of specific failure mode(s) related to the fault detection • Quantification of the extent of fault development to support maintenance planning Despite the availability of various popular ML approaches to develop models for asset condition, eg, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Local Outlier Factor (LOF), One Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM), ML approaches are black box approaches and fully dependant on asset data; they make no assumptions about the asset or its failure modes. Practical industrial experiences indicate that such approaches are not always successful and often lead to several types of false positives and false negatives. Raising an alarm when the asset is completely healthy or vice versa increases unplanned costs.

The online condition monitoring data is combined with data science uses one of two techniques, either detection of anomalies where online measurements deviate from normal operating behaviour or the identification of known failure characteristics where online measurements closely match a “fault signature” Both techniques use a data model: the former represents “good health” and the latter captures the “data signature” present under fault conditions. The former is often the best approach to use because there is almost always sufficient historical data available that represents good health. This health data enables the model to be trained. Conversely, there is usually no- or insufficient data available to represent all possible failure conditions. The second model also relies on equipment characteristics, and these depend on the installation and operating conditions. This means the data that relates to a specific machine is usually insufficient to train an accurate fault model. With the hybrid approach, an engineering model is used to quantify the extent of the deviation of the online measurements from the health model. A Failure Mode Analysis model is used. FMEA is a core component of Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) programs that already exist for the most commonly encountered equipment and systems. It defines the potential detection and identification of a fault.

It offers countless solutions across all industries. Artificial intelligence is a major market player in the business world. AI plays a key role in data analysis, marketing, finance, business, advertising, medicine, technology, science and engineering where machines are learning from stimuli and reacting in ways more human than ever before. Artificial intelligence has several advantages and disadvantages, so it's important to know how to use it to maximize its potential within your organization. What Exactly is Artificial Intelligence and Its Subsets? Artificial intelligence is intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the natural intelligence displayed by humans or animals. It applies to computing systems designed to perform tasks usually reserved for human intelligence using logic, if-then rules, and decision trees. AI recognizes patterns from vast amounts of quality data providing insights, predicting outcomes, and making complex decisions. Over the past few years, more and more companies have been experimenting with AI, advancing their data-related capabilities, acquiring new technologies and talent, and integrating AI into their business processes. In coming years, AI will likely become even more pervasive. Just as we no longer talk about isolated mobile strategies (they’re just part of doing business), AI will soon become standard and routine—maybe even faster than we expect. Here are 4 of its most popular subsets: Machine learning (ML): With machine learning technologies, computers can be taught to analyze data, identify hidden patterns, make classifications, and predict future outcomes. Deep learning (DL): Deep learning is a subset of machine learning based upon a conceptual model of the human brain called “neural networks.” It’s called deep learning because the neural networks have multiple layers that interconnect. Natural language processing (NL): Natural language processing is the ability to extract or generate meaning and intent from text in a readable, stylistically natural, and grammatically correct form. Computer vision (CV): Computer vision is the ability to extract meaning and intent from visual elements, whether characters (in the case of document digitization) or the categorization of content in images, such as faces, objects, scenes, and activities. Artificial intelligence has many advantages, but also disadvantages, and everything will depend on how AI will be used or misused. Artificial intelligence has massive potential for creating a better world to live in. The most important role for humans will be to ensure that the rise of the AI doesn’t get out of hand. What Are The Advantages of Artificial Intelligence? 1) Less Human Errors: There is less room for error with artificial intelligence. 2) Doing More Complex Tasks: Artificial intelligence can perform a more laborious task with extra hard work and with greater responsibility. 3) Available 24/7: Educational Institutes and Helpline centers are getting many queries and issues which can be handled effectively using AI. 4) Providing Digital Assistance: Virtual assistants inside smartphones, PCs, or connected home speakers, like Apple’s Siri, Microsoft’s Cortana, Google’s Google Now, Samsung’s Galaxy S8’s Bixby and Amazon’s Alexa, provide contextual information. 5) Assisting Humans in Repetitive Tasks: In banks, we often see many verifications of documents to get a loan which is a repetitive task for the owner of the bank. Using AI Cognitive Automation the owner can speed up the process of verifying the documents by which both the customers and the owner will be benefited. 6) More Productive : Emotions are not associated with artificial intelligence robots and therefore the mood doesn’t hamper the efficiency. Thus they are always productive. 7) Educating The Next Generation: Nowadays, medical professionals are trained with artificial surgery simulators. It uses applications which help in detecting and monitoring neurological disorders and stimulate the brain functions. 8) Right Decision Making: The integration of AI tools in the business world has improved the efficiency of organizations. What Are The Disadvantages of Artificial Intelligence? 1) It's An Expensive Technology: It’s true that artificial intelligence comes with a high cost, but there is no such thing as a free lunch either. It requires huge costs as it is a complex machine. Apart from the installation cost, its repair and maintenance also require huge costs. 2) Lack of Emotion and Moral Values: No matter how smart a machine becomes, it can never replicate a human. Machines are rational but very inhuman as they don’t possess emotions and moral values. They don’t know what is ethical and what’s legal and because of this, don’t have their own judgment making skills. 3) No Feelings: Artificial intelligence doesn’t have feelings and because of which there is nothing like working with a whole heart or with full passion for them. There is no sense of belonging or togetherness or a human touch. 4) Still Not Creative Enough: The current artificial intelligence is still narrow and isn't creative. They can only do what they are being taught or commanded. Though they help in designing and creating, they can’t match the power of a human brain. 5) Destroying Jobs: If in the future, human beings don’t add to their skills, then in no time, we can see that they will be replaced with machines. 6) Relying Too Much on AI Leads To Addiction : As we rely on machines to make everyday tasks more efficient, we risk technology addiction. 7) Making Humans Feel Lazy: Artificial intelligence applications automate the majority of tedious and repetitive tasks. Since we do not have to memorize things or solve puzzles to get the job done, we tend to use our brains less and less. This addiction to AI can cause problems to future generations. 8) No Ethics: Ethics and morality are important human features that can be difficult to incorporate into an AI. The rapid progress of AI has raised a number of concerns that one day, AI will grow uncontrollably, and eventually wipe out humanity. This moment is referred to as the AI singularity. How To Use Artificial Intelligence in Your Business? Businesses can use artificial intelligence to simplify the work of their employees in the following ways: Automated insights Spam filters Email categorisation Voice to text features Automated responders and online customer support Process automation Sales and Business forecasting Cybecurity surveillance Fraud detection and prevention for online transactions Dynamic price optimisation What Are the Most Popular Applications of Artificial Intelligence? There are a vast number of things that artificial intelligence can do on a daily basis: Interpreting video feeds from drones carrying out visual inspections of infrastructure such as oil pipelines. Organizing personal and business calendars. Detecting fake news. Identifying audios, videos and images Classifying objects to avoid collisions and a better navigation experience Preventing cybersecurity attacks Responding to simple customer-service queries. Improving internet of things devices. Coordinating with other intelligent systems to carry out tasks like booking a hotel at a suitable time and location. Reporting faulty products. Assisting financial services organizations with high frequency trading Helping radiologists to spot potential tumors in X-rays. Speeding up production. Flagging inappropriate content online, detecting wear and tear in elevators from data gathered by IoT devices. Generating a 3D model of the world from satellite imagery. Why Should Your Organization Invest in Artificial Intelligence in the Near Future? Why Do More Companies Invest in Artificial Intelligence? Many business executives are thinking about AI in terms of cost savings and efficiency. Organizations also invest in many artificial intelligence solutions to enhance their IT department, cybersecurity, production, manufacturing, engineering, construction and product development. Business functions such as marketing, human resources, legal, and procurement can also be enhanced thanks to artificial intelligence. Automate a process or function that would normally be done by a human —for example, automating back-end operations, managing cloud and IT networks, or detecting patterns in video Optimize the efficiency of a process or function —for example, preventing fraud, identifying defective products, finding errors in software code, or personalizing advertising placement Enhance the ability of individuals to accomplish tasks or enable them to do something they typically could not —for example, forecasting demand, improving compliance, augmenting threat detection by security analysts, diagnosing a patient, identifying a problem with a mechanical system, or drawing out new customer insights How To Strike The Right Equilibrium With Artificial Intelligence? Over the past few years, more and more companies have been experimenting with AI, advancing their data-related capabilities, acquiring new technologies and talent, and integrating AI into their business processes. In coming years, AI will likely become even more pervasive. Just as we no longer talk about isolated mobile strategies (they’re just part of doing business), AI will soon become standard and routine—maybe even faster than we expect. As a result, companies that already have an AI-powered edge should continue differentiating themselves. Companies that haven’t yet adopted AI technologies should begin to accelerate efforts across their products, processes, and talent. As late entrants begin to catch up with industry leaders, AI adopters should consider focusing on three actions to maintain their edge (see figure 3): Pursue creative approaches: unlocking value beyond efficiency and becoming more creative with their AI applications, balancing evolution and transformation Become a smarter consumer: with more AI vendors, platforms, and technologies available, becoming better at evaluating buying options Actively address risks: not allowing the perceived risks of AI to derail efforts by becoming more conscientious about how AI gets used, and by building trust with customers and partners Conclusion Whether we realize it or not, artificial intelligence is all around us and playing an active role in our daily lives. Every business and every professional should carefully evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of artificial intelligence . It has served us pretty well and has made life easier in various ways, but it's important to strike the right balance.

David Thompson Sep 13, 2021 02:17 PM EDT Facebook Twitter Linkedin Comment Mail Close (Photo : Photo by Mikael Blomkvist from Pexels) Is Artificial Intelligence the future of CRM? Artificial intelligence is quickly becoming a hot topic, but what does it have to do with CRM? The answer may surprise you. AI is the future of customer service and will change how we interact with customers in the next few years. It's no longer an option for businesses that want to stay competitive. Companies are investing heavily in AI because they see that it has potential for increased productivity, better quality work, and reduced costs. The Benefits of Combining Artificial Intelligence with CRM List of benefits. Number one benefit is first bolded, followed by bullet points for the other three benefits. Increased productivity AI allows employees to spend more time focusing on value-added activities while customer relationship management system chatbots handle repetitive tasks like answering FAQs and helping customers with problems that are easy to solve (for example, ""I forgot my password""). Better quality work Replacing human interactions with artificial intelligence can improve the overall experience for businesses and their clients because it removes any frustration or confusion caused by miscommunications between employees and customers. For example, suppose a live agent is dealing with multiple chats at once. In that case, they may not be able to answer questions as thoroughly as an automated bot would be able to simply by virtue of having more time to devote to each inquiry. Reduced costs Implementing AI into customer service is a lot cheaper than hiring new employees or outsourcing agents, saving businesses money in the long run. Accurate Client Insights Through Artificial Intelligence Artificial intelligence is also useful for giving businesses actionable insights about their customers. AI can gather data and analyze it to give companies a better idea of what works, what doesn't work, and how they should progress in the future, all while doing it faster than humans could ever hope to accomplish on their own. Ai Within Marketing Artificial intelligence isn't just useful for customer service; it can also be used to help marketing teams gather insights and make better decisions. For example, AI could monitor a company's social media presence and determine which posts are the most impactful so that marketers know what content is worth producing more of in the future. AI will bring about drastic changes within the next few years as companies begin adopting this new technology into their existing strategies. The time to start thinking about how you're going to implement artificial intelligence into your own business practices is now; otherwise, you'll fall behind when all of your competitors have already achieved greater success than they were able to before due to increased productivity, improved quality work, and reduced costs thanks in part to AI integration. How To Integrate Artificial Intelligence Into CRM? List step-by-step instructions on different ways you can integrate artificial intelligence into CRM without having an advanced degree in computer science or being a developer yourself. There are several options when deciding whether or not your business wants to implement artificial intelligence into its customer service operations: Build your own chatbot from scratch using third-party tools like Chatfuel. Use prebuilt chatbots like ManyChat. Use a CRM platform that comes with built-in AI features such as Salesforce. While the first two options are good for businesses on a budget, using an entire system designed to help you work smarter is likely your best bet. Conclusion It's clear that artificial intelligence will play an increasingly important role for companies of all sizes in the coming years, especially when it comes to customer service and CRM systems. Although chatbots can't replace live agents entirely yet (at least not without sacrificing some benefits), they are becoming extremely sophisticated every day, so we expect this trend to continue growing at breakneck speed over the next few decades.

By Laura Lovett September 13, 2021 11:50 am Share Photo: Longhua Liao/Getty Images With an eye on the oncology space, Israeli startup Medial EarlySign has inked a deal with pharma giant Roche Diagnostics International to commercialize an artificial intelligence tool that helps detect cancer early. As part of the collaboration agreement, the pair will develop, clinically validate and then commercialize the product. Initially the companies will focus on the gastric cancer space. The clinical decision support tool will use EarlySign’s software that incorporates lab results, EHR data and other clinical care. WHY IT MATTERS According to the American Cancer Society , stomach cancer accounts for roughly 1.5% of all new cancers diagnosed in the U.S. In fact, in 2021 the society estimates that there are 25,560 new cases of gastric cancer, and 11,180 deaths associated with the condition. The companies are pitching this new deal as a way to help catch gastric cancer early. The pair note that the condition often develops slowly and goes undetected for some time. ""Our next steps are to help bring new diagnostics methodologies to the global market through better management and utilization of vast amounts of data in ways that were previously unimaginable,” Ori Geva, CEO and cofounder of EarlySign, said in a statement. “By coupling our proven machine learning infrastructure and data science expertise with the global leadership of Roche, we are looking forward to bringing forth a new class of predictive tools to make a significant contribution to improve human health."" THE LARGER TREND This isn’t the first partnership for Medial EarlySign. In March, the company signed a deal with Datos Health in order to offer an integrated platform that pinpoints high-risk patients who could benefit from remote care. Medial EarlySign has a history of working in the oncology space. A 2018 study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology CCI found the company’s AI tool flagged 8% of patients in a large trial group that were later diagnosed with cancer or precancerous lesions. Roche Diagnostics has also been interested in the digital health space for some time. In 2020, the company teamed up with investment firm aMoon to launch an early-stage investment program dubbed StarFinder Lab that is focused on novel diagnostic technologies, and AI data analysis and digital health in particular.

(Getty Images) After penning a major funding round earlier this year, the artificial intelligence-powered drug designer Exscientia is showing no signs of slowing down, with the announcement of plans to go public. The Oxford, U.K.-based developer confidentially filed for a $100 million Nasdaq IPO in late June, shortly after posting a $225 million series D that could include an additional $300 million in equity. The offering's exact pricing terms have not yet been disclosed, according to Renaissance Capital , and could climb higher. Those proceeds will come alongside a recent $35 million equity investment from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which will support at least five small molecules aimed at COVID-19, influenza and other viruses that may spur the next global pandemic. Exscientia is set to provide matching funds for the effort. The company’s pipeline is spearheaded by three AI-designed drug candidates that have begun phase 1 clinical trials, including one immuno-oncology agent for solid tumors in partnership with Evotec and two psychiatry-focused assets being co-developed with Sumitomo Dainippon. RELATED: SoftBank leads funding that could net up to $525M for Exscientia's AI drug platform Behind them are more than 25 active projects in cancer, inflammation and rare diseases, Exscientia said in its prospectus , including four potential drugs lined up for IND submissions with biopharma partners such as Bristol Myers Squibb and Aperion Biologics. Using its AI programs to speed up design and discovery work, Exscientia claims it can cut the total amount of time needed by 70%—its most advanced programs have reportedly gone from target identification to candidate selection in less than 18 months, down from the industry average of four-and-a-half years. That pitch attracted the attention of SoftBank this past April, with its Vision Fund 2 leading the company’s $225 million series D round. That fundraising also included the international conglomerate's commitment to an additional $300 million in equity funding, available for Exscientia to tap at its discretion. RELATED: Bristol Myers' $1.2B discovery pact with Exscientia strikes gold as first drug candidate selected Since then, Exscientia collected a $20 million payout in its $1.2 billion drug design partnership with BMS after landing on an immune-system modulating candidate while chasing a previously hard-to-hit target. BMS has in-licensed the drug and is set to take command of its clinical and commercial development. This past summer also saw Exscientia spend some of its haul on the $60 million acquisition of Allcyte , an Austrian AI developer looking to predict how well cancer therapies perform in individual patients. Exscientia also inked a collaboration with EQRx to find low-cost options for cancer treatments. Meanwhile, Exscientia’s contemporaries in AI-powered drug discovery have also seen their wallets swell: Recursion posted a $436 million IPO on the heels of a $239 million series D, while insitro and Insilico Medicine have collected $400 million and $255 million rounds, respectively.

A new dashboard , launched today by the Johns Hopkins Center for Communication Programs , unpacks that survey data to help explain why—and how experts can work to increase acceptance rates. The researchers found that the primary reasons around the world for resisting vaccination include fears about side effects, a desire to wait until more people have had the shots so they know they are safe, and a lack of confidence in whether the vaccine really works. ""Our analysis of this large trove of data finds that while vaccine hesitancy is real, there are many people around the globe who can be encouraged to get their doses—if public health officials can build and share their messages to address their concerns."" Dominick Shattuck Johns Hopkins Center for Communication Programs These latest survey results, based on responses gathered between Aug. 16 and 31, can be found in the new COVID Behaviors dashboard , an interactive tool created with data collected from more than 12 million people from 115 countries. The survey—believed to be the world's largest daily survey of global COVID knowledge, attitudes, and practices—has been fielded every day since May 20, 2021. It is expected to continue until the end of this year, and new data will become available every two weeks. The dashboard is intended to be used by policymakers, government officials, and public health practitioners at national and sub-national levels to better understand the behavioral drivers behind vaccine uptake, masking, and physical distancing that can prevent the spread of COVID-19. ""Our analysis of this large trove of data finds that while vaccine hesitancy is real, there are many people around the globe who can be encouraged to get their doses—if public health officials can build and share their messages to address their concerns,"" says Dominick Shattuck, CCP's director of monitoring evaluation and learning and one of the leaders of the COVID behaviors project. Adds Marla Shaivitz, CCP's director of digital strategy: ""The dashboard can be used as a roadmap for policymakers to identify and engage with citizens to encourage them to be vaccinated to protect themselves and their families from COVID-19. In many countries, this dashboard fills an important data gap. It offers the most comprehensive data some governments have access to on how COVID behaviors are changing and what they can do to intervene."" The dashboard is the product of a collaboration among CCP, the World Health Organization's Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, and Facebook. The data are generated from the COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey, which is administered in the United States by the Delphi Group at Carnegie Mellon University and in other countries by the University of Maryland Social Data Science Center . The two universities collect the survey data from a random sample of Facebook users and CCP analyzes the responses. A previous COVID behaviors dashboard, also led by CCP, was based on smaller, less frequent surveys from June 2020 through March 2021. Image caption: A woman works in a face mask manufacturing shop in a factory in Harare, Zimbabwe. Image credit :  International Labour Organization In this latest survey, reasons for vaccine hesitancy vary by country. In Senegal, the two most common reasons for hesitancy are concerns about side effects and whether the vaccine will work. Education around vaccine science and side effects could work to encourage vaccine uptake in Senegal. In the Netherlands, however, unvaccinated respondents were most likely to say that they don't believe they need a vaccine. When asked why not, their main reasons were because they are not a member of a high-risk group, or they don't believe COVID-19 is a serious illness. Each underlying perception requires a different messaging response. The dashboard sheds light on how other behaviors have evolved over the last four months as well. In the United States, for example, 65% of those who responded to the survey between Aug. 16 and 31 said they had been shopping indoors in the previous 24 hours, and two-thirds those who had been shopping said they wore masks. Mask wearing steadily decreased in the U.S. until the middle of July but has been rising since the highly transmissible Delta variant became the dominant strain, and case counts and hospitalizations began rising again to record levels in many states. In India, where an outbreak has fallen from its May peak, only 29% of respondents had been shopping indoors in the previous 24 hours and the vast majority of them (87%) were wearing masks, suggesting there is a long way to go before things get back to normal. Since March 2020, a staggering 223 million COVID cases—and 4.6 million deaths—have been reported around the world, according to Johns Hopkins University's COVID-19 dashboard . More than 5.3 billion vaccine doses have been administered globally, though just over 2% of those doses have been administered in Africa. USAID has sent more than 110 million doses to low- and middle-income countries and COVAX, a worldwide initiative aimed at equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines, has distributed more than 236 million doses. As vaccine access increases, governments will need to develop strategies to sensitize citizens to accurate information and the benefits of vaccines. In addition to findings about vaccine hesitancy, the dashboard also features data on why many people who want vaccines can't seem to access them. In Brazil, for example, where 65% of the unvaccinated respondents in the Aug. 16-31 survey period said they probably or definitely want a vaccine, 23% of those who want one said they couldn't get a shot because they are not eligible for one, and 34% said there were no appointments available. Armed with knowledge from the dashboard, officials in those countries can aim to work with local communities to make vaccine appointments more accessible—once vaccines are widely available—and to better spread the word about appointments that are available and when, where, and how to secure them. ""We are at a critical time for global COVID-19 vaccine rollouts, yet populations are oversaturated with information, disinformation, and rumors,"" says Jeni Stolow of WHO's Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network. ""Continuously producing timely evidence-based and effective health communication is a major challenge in this second year of the pandemic. This dashboard can support public health practitioners around the globe in their endeavors to tailor, target, and reinvigorate their local COVID-19 vaccine outreach efforts."" While many unvaccinated people around the world say they are unlikely to get vaccinated, in many countries, large percentages of the population say they would choose to get their children vaccinated once a vaccine becomes available. In India and Guatemala, well over 90% of survey respondents said they would definitely or probably vaccinate their children. Data from Aug. 16 through 31 show the figure was 86% in Mozambique, 72% in the United States, and 47% in Serbia. ""The volume of data that has and will continue to be collected on COVID-19 will be of great value to policymakers and health practitioners, if the data are strategically used,"" says Douglas Storey, CCP's director for communication science and research. ""This dashboard offers deep insights into behaviors around the world and will be a guide for those aiming to stop the spread of this devastating disease."" CCP will host a webinar about the new dashboard with experts from the center and WHO's Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network on Tuesday, Sept. 21, at 9:30 a.m. EST.

Photo by John Griffin Data science and artificial intelligence (AI) have become powerful tools for generating new knowledge, fueling innovation, and dealing with some of society’s most pressing problems. However, “big data” and machine learning tools can perpetuate biases that advantage some people, while disadvantaging others. Now, a new National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award of nearly $3 million will enable Stony Brook University to provide interdisciplinary cross-training to PhD students in the data sciences alongside PhD students in the human-centered sciences to detect and address biases in data, models, people, and institutions. This innovative five-year training project spans eight departments in Stony Brook’s College of Arts and Sciences (Departments of Psychology, Linguistics, Economics, Sociology, Political Science, and Neurobiology and Behavior) and the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences (Departments of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics and Statistics ). Human-centered scientists will master cutting-edge computational methods that empower their research; they will take bridge courses in computer science as well as data science graduate courses and will earn a graduate certificate in AI. Data science students will earn a certificate in the human-centered sciences; they will learn theories and practices within these disciplines including study designs, associated limitations, and ethical issues. Together, trainees from both tracks will collaborate on convergent research projects that unite deep disciplinary knowledge in human-centered sciences with techniques in data science and AI. They will develop strong identities as computational human-centered scientists capable of addressing the impacts of data-driven technology upon human beings and society. The project will fund qualifying trainees with NSF-level stipends of $34K and will also train non-funded trainees, including international students. It will be led by principal investigator Susan Brennan, Department of Psychology, with co-PIs C.R. Ramakrishnan, Department of Computer Science; Wei Zhu, Department of Applied Math and Statistics; Bonita London, Department of Psychology; and Jeffrey Heinz, Department of Linguistics. “Our science students tend to gather in distinct siloes, with much higher proportions of women in the human-centered sciences than in the data sciences,” said Brennan. “The lack of diversity in today’s AI workforce is concerning because addressing bias and solving hard societal problems demands bringing together different perspectives. We want our trainees to learn how to recognize and deal with bias where it can do harm.” Other SBU faculty participants and senior personnel (listed alphabetically by department) include Adryan Wallace (Departments of Africana Studies, Women’s, Gender and Sexuality Studies, and Political Science); H. Andrew Schwarz, Klaus Mueller, Niranjan Balasubramanian, and Steven Skiena of Computer Science; Marina Azzimonti (Economics); Mónica Bugallo (Electrical & Computer Engineering); Owen Rambow (Linguistics); Il Memming Park (Neurobiology and Behavior); Reuben Kline (Political Science); Christian Luhmann (Psychology); and Jason Jones (Sociology). Psychologist Catherine Good of Baruch College, CUNY will serve as Evaluator. The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The program is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary or convergent research areas through comprehensive traineeship models that are innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs.

But at eBay, optimizing the software to run on a particular piece of hardware using distillation and quantization techniques was absolutely essential to ensure scalability. eBay ’s head of machine learning and NLP Selcuk Kopru described how the company optimizes its machine learning models in support of its AI-driven marketplace in a presentation made earlier today at the AI Hardware Summit , a hybrid event that’s taking place virtually and at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California this week. “[I]n order to build a truly global marketplace that is driven by state of the art and powerful and scalable AI services,” Kopru said, “you have to do a lot of optimizations after model training, and specifically for the target hardware.” eBay certainly is no stranger to scale. With 1.5 billion active listings from more than 19 million active sellers trying to reach 159 million active buyers, the ecommerce giant has a global reach that is matched by only a handful of firms. Machine learning and other AI techniques, such as natural language processing (NLP), play big roles in scaling eBay’s operations to reach its massive audience. For instance, automatically generated descriptions of product listings is crucial for displaying information on the small screens of smart phones, Kopru said. eBay trains its version of the BERT transformer model using a 64 GPU system (image courtesy eBay) “The full item description is too big to display on mobile screen, and generation of a description summary is essential in this experience,” he said. “Feature extraction from product reviews, filtering of product reviews, shipping and delivery estimation, and payments and fraud detection in member-to-member communications – they are all benefiting from AI.” eBay uses a host of AI and ML techniques to glean insight from listings and other data that it possesses. That includes neural network-based transformer models, like BERT, GPT-2, and GPT-3, for inferring information from text, as well as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), a supervised machine learning algorithm, for image classification. For text understanding and summarization, eBay uses a custom version of the large BERT transformer model, called eBERT. As Kopru explained, the company starts by developing a similarity function that presents the titles of the product entries as vectors in a shared space. In his presentation at AI Hardware Summit, the product entry space was limited to two-dimensions. “Of course, real applications can increase to hundreds of dimensions,” he said. Finding the similarity between item titles helps in matching the listings to products in the catalog and can also be used to find duplicate products. “Having a clean catalog is very important in any ecommerce experience,” Kopru said. eBay trains eBERT on a cluster composed of 64 Nvidia V100 GPUs. According to Kopru, it takes two weeks to complete a round of training for the eBERT model. Because training eBERT is such an expensive task, the company takes pains to ensure eBay researchers and engineers can access the trained model in a very efficient way, with just a few lines of Python code. eBay uses a NUMA setup to speed neural inference for its eBERT model (image courtesy eBay) But because of its size, eBert is not suitable to use online for inferencing purposes. “You cannot just put it into production,” Kopru said. “Therefore, we use techniques like model distillation and quantization to improve the throughput of the models.” Distillation is a way to compress a model by using a smaller “student” model to match a large pre-trained “teacher” model. It includes specific techniques aimed at minimizing the loss of precision. Quantization, meanwhile, is a method used to execute some of a model’s operations on tensors with integers rather than floating point values. The accuracy tradeoff from using distillation and quantization are worth it to eBay, Kopru said. “We can train 3x faster models and 3x more throughput can be achieved by giving up 3% of the accuracy,” he said. “This tradeoff is a good one based on the results we are getting. We are willing to continue to do that.” While eBay does all of its deep learning training purely on GPUs, for inference, it uses a hybrid approach that includes CPUs. For inference tasks, eBay uses Intel ’s Deep Learning Boost (DL Boost) technology, which implements Vector Neural Network Instructions (VNNI) on Intel’s AVX-512 instruction set. It also utilizes 8-bit integer quantization, Kopru said. The system is deployed and scaled horizontally on a Kubernetes cluster configured using NUMA, he said. “Our custom implementation doubled the throughput with half of the latency compared to a non-VNNI implementation,” he said. eBay uses some of the same techniques to optimize the kNN setup, which is used for image classification. The company has paired its kNN image classification system with a Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) library to optimize search in the kNN space. For inference, it also brought in 8-digit integer quantization and Intel’s DL Boost library. Selcuk Kopru is head of machine learning and NLP at eBay The use of HNSW enables kNN search to perform at a high level and maintain low latency and high throughput on a catalog that contains a billion items, each with up to 768 dimensions, according to Kopru. “Compared to the existing implementation, we have observed up to 2.5X speed up in terms of latency, from 17 milliseconds to 7 milliseconds,” he said. Kopru left his audience with a few thoughts on how they might apply his learnings to their particular problems. For starters, similarity is a powerful tool that can be used to solve many AI problems in e-commerce and in other disciplines, Kopru said. “My second message is for latency and throughput,” he said. “Many optimizations need to be done, almost at every step of the machine learning lifecycle. Whether it is in training or inferencing, we have to make sure that we are using the right optimization methods, such as distillation and quantization on those platforms.” Finally, Kopru encourages practitioners to consider using a hybrid approach for inferencing to achieve utilization and cost efficiency goals. eBay also keeps a watchful eye on TPUs for benchmarking purposes. “These are well-known techniques and I really suggests everyone is using those techniques,” he said.

Updated: 13 Sep 2021, 10:42 PM IST Dattaraj Rao Zero-shot AI can save hours spent on searching for the needle in a haystack Read Full Story Artificial intelligence (AI) is being looked upon as the next frontier to make cyber-defence robust and scalable. The key aspects that make AI and particularly machine learning (ML) attractive in cybersecurity is the ability to learn from large volumes of telemetry data and find patterns of abnormal behaviour. ML algorithms can be used to find anomalies in different parts of the enterprise like application logs, network flows, user activities and authentication logs. As enterprises adopt models like zero-trust with strict identity verification and explicit permissions, augmenting these with ML algorithms to monitor user behaviour patterns becomes critical. Modern security information and event management and intrusion detection systems leverage ML to correlate network features, identify patterns in data and highlight anomalies corresponding to attacks. Security researchers spend many hours understanding these attacks and trying to classify them into known kinds like port sweep, password guess, teardrop, etc. However, due to the constantly changing attack landscape and the emergence of advanced persistent threats (APTs), hackers are continuously finding new ways to attack systems.

A static list of classification of attacks will not be able to adapt to new and novel tactics adopted by adversaries. Also, due to the constant flow of alarms generated by multiple sources in the network, it becomes difficult to distinguish and prioritize particular types of attacks—the classic alarm flooding problem. A possible solution would be if we had a smart system that could auto-label alarms and categorize them so that the analyst can focus on particular alarm types. We propose a dynamic classification system using a zero-shot classification approach to ML. What exactly is this? The traditional approach to applying ML is supervised, where labelled data points are used to train models to make predictions. For example, a classifier model may process a record logged by a network monitor and classify it as an attack. While this is useful, these models can only learn from previously known attacks; so, a human would need to annotate the network flow for the attack data and feed it to build the model. The other approach becoming popular is unsupervised, where models learn to observe “normal"" behaviour and flag any anomalies. This approach can highlight unknown attack patterns but only provide anomaly information to the security analyst. One approach to tackle this is an upcoming research area in AI/ML called Explainable AI (XAI). Here, the models are either redesigned or enhanced to provide an explanation along with the prediction. So, when the model predicts an anomaly, it will also mention which feature values made it make that decision. XAI and zero-shot learning can be applied to different areas of a cybersecurity ecosystem. Let’s take an example of an ML model that monitors network traffic in an office network. Say, it flags a data transmission above 100MB happening from a network computer to a Google drive account as an anomaly—different from normal network flows. If we show the security operation centre analyst additional parameters that made us flag this as anomaly, like size of data files and destination domain, this information can save the analyst valuable time in classifying this as a data exfiltration attack. The system can further take feedback from the analyst and start auto-labelling new such attacks as data exfiltration. Extrapolate this to a network with thousands of nodes and users, explainability and zero-shot learning can save hours of valuable time spent by analysts in searching for the needle in the haystack. In today’s world, enterprises face APTs, which are well-funded attackers that focus on a high-value target and can stay undetected inside networks for days. Behavioural analytics becomes key to understand patterns and identify tactics, techniques and procedures used by attackers. Zero-shot learning models that decipher tactics like reconnaissance, privilege escalation and exfiltration can be extremely valuable to prevent major damage. Over time, this active learning system can learn from feedback. TRENDING STORIES See All Premium Flipkart announces Big Billion Days sale, teases discou ....

The European Commission outlined its plans to regulate AI, including medical devices and in vitro diagnostics that feature the technology, earlier this year. Under the proposal, the European Union would require high-risk AI systems to ""comply with certain mandatory requirements"" before coming to market. The Commission acknowledged a risk of overlap with existing regulations but envisioned the framework complementing requirements such as the Medical Devices Regulation. However, MedTech Europe contends the proposal falls short of that vision. In feedback to the Commission, the EU medtech trade group highlighted multiple examples of perceived ""misalignment"" between MDR and IVDR and the Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA). MedTech Europe sees the misalignments having serious consequences. ""There are concerns that the AIA would in effect create the need for manufacturers to undertake duplicative certification/conformity assessment, via two Notified Bodies, and maintain two sets of technical documentation, should misalignments between AIA and MDR/IVDR not be resolved. Duplication of this kind would lead to unnecessary overlaps in the regulatory approval of AI as/in medical technology, which could have a negative effect on the timely access of citizens and patients to highly innovative and fairly priced AI medical technology in the EU,""  MedTech Europe wrote. The feedback covers a handful of specific areas in which MedTech Europe believes the regulations are misaligned. MedTech Europe's concerns about duplicative certification stem from a ""very possible scenario"" it sketched out in its feedback. If a notified body that is designated for MDR or IVDR lacks AI capabilities, ""the risk of needing two separate technical documentation submissions, leading to two separate conformity assessments and certifications, must be avoided."" MedTech Europe also sees a lack of clarity about the designation of notified bodies for ""AI-specific competencies,"" the time required to ramp up the availability of notified bodies with AI and medtech capabilities, and the roles and responsibilities of notified bodies as areas needing clarification. A further set of potential problems are tied to the interaction between AIA and EU rules on data protection and privacy. MedTech Europe highlighted several areas in which AIA may conflict with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). One example is the AIA requirement that datasets used to train, validate and test high-risk AI systems are ""relevant"" and ""representative."" MedTech Europe contends restrictions imposed by GDPR may make it difficult to comply with the requirement. Risk classification is another perceived issue. As MedTech Europe sees it, AIA would put most healthcare uses of AI in its highest risk class in a ""clear deviation from how medical technologies are regulated in Europe and around the world."" The deviation will cause confusion among regulators and ""create additional, unnecessary complexity in the regulatory approval process,"" the trade group wrote. MedTech Europe's expectation that medical devices and IVDs will fall into AIA's high-risk category is underpinned by ""the proposed broad definition of AI and risk classification."" The criticism of the definition follows an early response by a senior research scientist at the Flatiron Institute's Center for Computational Mathematics, who said it ""feels hopelessly vague with phrasing like 'wide variety of methods' and the inclusion of 'statistical approaches'."" Other groups have since taken shots at the proposal. The Center for Data Innovation found AIA could cost the EU economy up to €31 billion ($37 billion) over the next five years and cause investments to contract by up to 20%. The analysis found AIA will cost European businesses €10.9 billion a year by 2025. A business with a turnover of €10 million that deploys a high-risk AI system would see profits fall by 40%. The analysis is based on the Commission's own impact assessment and projections of the growth of AI investment in the EU. Absent AIA, the EU expects investment in AI to grow to almost €70 billion by 2025, up from €16 billion today. The Center for Data Innovation sees AIA as a major headwind to that forecast. In feedback to the Commission, the Center said that ""AIA is too broad in its attempt to regulate an entire stack of technologies and applications at such an early stage in the development of AI."" Other groups have made similar points to the Center and MedTech Europe, with the Japan Business Federation warning AIA could ""hinder the appetite for investment in Europe"" and Digital Poland Foundation calling the AI definition ""too broad."" However, other groups have responded more favorably. An EU mapping trade group called the proposal ""a good start"" and a group that works to ensure the digital world caters to young people hailed parts of AIA as ""ground-breaking legislation."" The breadth of organizations that have already responded to the proposal points to the challenges the EU will face in trying to come up with a version of AIA that works for medtech and all of the other stakeholders affected by the regulation. MedTech Europe wants more time to adapt to whatever AIA brings, arguing that at least 48 months, rather than the 24 months proposed by the Commission, are needed for ""the entire ecosystem to be ready and compliant with a new regulatory framework."" post share tweet print email Filed Under: Medical Devices, Policy & Regulation, Legal, Diagnostics, Digital Health, Imaging Editors' picks Brian Tucker/MedTech Dive Remote monitoring, wearable companies look to capitalize on virtual care boom: JPM21 Diabetes players Dexcom and Insulet both projected business growth and market expansion for this year during presentations.

The grant, awarded by the National Institutes of Health, is one of the largest ever to the medical school. It will support the work of the Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, led by Muredach Reilly, MBBCh, MSCE, professor of medicine and associate dean for clinical and translational research.  The Institute works in partnership with researchers and clinicians across Columbia University Irving Medical Center, NewYork-Presbyterian, and the New York State Psychiatric Institute to support all phases of clinical and translational science. The infusion of federal funding addresses a critical need in medical research. In labs at Columbia and at other universities across the nation, important scientific discoveries are made almost every day. But it typically takes a decade or more for a new scientific discovery to result in a new drug, medical device, or diagnostic tool. In 2006 the NIH launched a nationwide effort to identify and overcome scientific and organizational barriers that slow the movement of discoveries from the lab bench to the patient. The program, called the Clinical and Translational Science Award Program, today funds translational research “hubs” at more than 50 universities. The funding has enabled the Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research to establish more than 70 services and programs to help Columbia researchers translate medical discoveries into treatments, including: Training, mentoring, and one-on-one consultation to researchers. The Irving Institute trained over 2,200 individuals and provided more than 3,300 consultations to researchers since 2016. Access to research facilities, infrastructure, and specialized equipment that may not be available in a researcher’s own lab or department. Seed funding, including $4 million for pilot projects that enable researchers to generate preliminary data that can be used in applying for larger grants. Assistance in launching clinical trials to test new therapies and diagnostic tools. The Irving Institute also provided funding for the development of RecruitMe, an online registry for people interested in volunteering for clinical trials led by Columbia researchers. More than 30,000 people have signed up to participate. The new infusion of funding from the National Center for Advancing Translational Science at the NIH will enable the Irving Institute to develop new programs, including a Research Navigation System to help match the needs of individual researchers and research teams to resources and services available at Columbia. The Institute will also offer expanded training opportunities and a “data concierge service” that will link researchers with experts in biostatistics, biomedical informatics, and data science. They will also engage community leaders as “ambassadors” to promote research that improves community health. Columbia University was first awarded a CTSA grant in 2006, and the grant has been renewed every five years since then, with funding totaling over $200 million through 2026. This year’s application for funding renewal received a perfect overall score from the NIH’s review committee. Comments on the funding award: Muredach P. Reilly, MBBCh MSCE, Principal Investigator and Director, Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research : “On behalf of all our partners, I am delighted and honored that we achieved a perfect score at peer review for this 5-year renewal cycle of our CTSA. I am proud of our outstanding team and our partners at the Medical Center, NewYork-Presbyterian, New York State Psychiatric Institute, and across the University, as well as our regional and national collaborators, for their support and future commitments. Standing on the shoulders of the institution and building on our prior success, we have established innovative plans for the next five years to create novel scientific advances, through multiple programs, trainings, multidisciplinary initiatives and more. A key focus will be expansion of our interdisciplinary team approach across the hub, expanded participatory engagement with communities in Washington Heights, Inwood, South Bronx, and Harlem, along with new partnerships regionally and nationally, to achieve our goal to translate research to practice locally, nationally and across the world.” Lee C. Bollinger, President, Columbia University : “The pace and breadth of discovery in biomedical research has the potential to transform medicine. To deliver on that promise, we must expand our capacity to translate new knowledge into new tools and treatments. We’re deeply grateful to the National Institutes of Health for their support of this vital work.” U.S. Senator Charles E. Schumer (NY) : “I am thankful that Columbia University's Irving Institute, one of the nation's leading centers for clinical research, has received this well-deserved additional funding. The Institute has gained national recognition for its programs, and the grant will continue the Institute's mission to improve the health and well-being of our State's communities through innovations in clinical and translational science."" U.S. Congressman Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) : “The Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC) has been a leader in clinical research, development of biomedical technologies, and advancements in translational science. Renewal of the Clinical and Translational Science Award to the Herbert and Florence Irving Institute for Clinical and Translational Research, a partnership of CUIMC and NewYork-Presbyterian, recognizes the scientific advancements of talented scientists and researchers and confidence that CUIMC will continue to shape the health and wellbeing of my constituents and patients around the world.” Anil K. Rustgi, MD, Interim Executive Vice President and Dean of the Faculties of Health Sciences and Medicine : “Under Dr. Reilly’s leadership, the Irving Institute has established a world class program to accelerate the application of medical discoveries, and especially to engage underserved populations in the clinical research process. These efforts are fundamental to our mission to integrate research, teaching, clinical care, and community service at Columbia.” Steven J. Corwin, MD, President and Chief Executive Officer, NewYork-Presbyterian : “The Irving Institute is advancing research that saves lives and improves the quality of life for our patients and the communities we serve. We are proud to partner with Columbia to help develop new innovative treatments for complex medical problems and bring these advances from the lab to the bedside faster. This grant will allow us to continue the important work of accelerating medical innovation for all.” Nabila El-Bassel, PhD, the Willma and Albert Musher Professor of Social Work : ""The Irving Institute engages in outstanding impactful research for the most vulnerable members of our society, and I value its promotion of multidisciplinary research collaboration within Columbia. Collaborating with the Irving Institute with the HEALing Communities Study (HCS) provided important insights for both HCS and for our new Center for Healing of Opioid and Other Substance Use Disorders – Enhancing Intervention, Development and Implementation (CHOSEN), helping inform both their community-based strategies and implementation research.""

Read this first If your deceased loved on (the decedent) left appreciated capital gain assets — such as real property and/or securities held in taxable brokerage firm accounts, the federal income tax basis of those assets are increased to reflect fair market value (FMV) as of: (1) the decedent’s date of death or (2) the alternate valuation date of six months later if the executor of the estate chooses to use the alternate valuation date.  Then, when an inherited capital gain asset is sold, federal capital gains tax is only owed the appreciation (if any) that occurs after the applicable magic date.  This pro-taxpayer rule can dramatically lower or even eliminate the federal income tax hit when an inherited asset is sold. 12h ago Motley Fool Why Crescent Point Energy Stock Rallied 14.4% Today Shares of Crescent Point Energy (NYSE: CPG) soared on Sept. 13, closing the day up 14.4% after the oil stock unexpectedly announced a big dividend raise.

Learn why this has hundreds of software teams building their applications in the cloud across multiple use cases and industries. Register here The Transform Technology Summits start October 13th with Low-Code/No Code: Enabling Enterprise Agility. Register now! In 2015, representatives from more than 196 countries met in Le Bourget, France to sign the Paris Agreement. The legally binding treaty limits global warming to a rise of well below 2 degrees Celsius compared to preindustrial levels, preferably capping warming at 1.5 degrees. While the Paris Agreement doesn’t spell out how the undersigned are expected to achieve this goal, some countries have pledged to cut their net climate emissions to zero by 2050. For these and other steps to be successful, reliable data is key. While the ability to evaluate companies’ carbon footprints will be critical for countries seeking to comply with the measures, only a fraction of companies currently disclose their greenhouse gas emissions. But researchers at Bloomberg Quant Research and Amazon Web Services claim to have successfully trained a machine learning model to estimate the emissions of businesses that don’t disclose their emissions. The researchers say investors could use this model to align their investments with international regulatory measures and achieve net-zero goals. Some regions, including the European Union, require investors to apply a “precautionary principle” that penalizes non-disclosing companies by overestimating their emissions. “Merely 2.27% of companies filing financial statements are disclosing their [greenhouse gas] emissions according to our environmental, social, and governance (ESG) datasets,” the coauthors wrote in a paper. “In order to make a meaningful change, we need to measure who is contributing [greenhouse gases] into the atmosphere and monitor their claims to decarbonize.” Training the model Prior work attempted to estimate companies’ carbon emissions using a combination of conventional statistical approaches and machine learning. But according to the researchers, these approaches relied on assumptions that don’t always hold true in reality, like the idea that companies in the same industry emit roughly the same level of emissions. To train their model, the researchers identified more than 1,000 features and 24,052 rows of disclosed emissions from datasets containing company financials (like balance sheets and income statements), corporate locations, and ESG records. The ESG records had over 500 metrics alone, covering areas like carbon emissions and resource and energy use; human rights and diversity and inclusion; and criteria based on management structure, executive compensation, and employee relations. In an experiment designed to evaluate the model’s accuracy, the researchers say the model closely estimated the emissions of companies in industries including health care, technology, financial, materials, real estate, utilities, energy, communications, and more. In future work, the team plans to add more features from datasets across areas like corporate policy, supply chain, and factory data. “By training a machine learning model on disclosed … emissions, we are able to estimate the emissions of other companies globally who do not disclose their emissions,” the researchers wrote. “In this paper, we show that our model provides accurate estimates of corporate … emissions.” While studies suggest some forms of machine learning contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, the technology has also been proposed as a tool to combat climate change. For example, an IBM project delivers farm cultivation recommendations from digital farm “twins” that simulate the future weather and soil conditions of real-world crops. Other researchers are using AI-generated images to help visualize climate change, and nonprofits like WattTime are working to reduce households’ carbon footprint by automating when electric vehicles, thermostats, and appliances are active based on where renewable energy is available. Facebook chief AI scientist Yann LeCun and Google Brain cofounder Andrew Ng, among others, have argued that mitigating climate change and promoting energy efficiency are worthy challenges for AI researchers.

Become an Insider and start reading now. Joaquin Quiñonero Candela has left Facebook after serving as its head of Responsible AI. Candela was tapped by CEO Mark Zuckerberg to battle misinformation on Facebook. Misinformation is still widespread on the largest social-media platform. Joaquin Quiñonero Candela, who most recently led Facebook's Responsible AI team, has left the company. Candela's work, and hardships leading the team tasked with reining in Facebook's artificial intelligence, was the subject of an MIT Tech Review feature earlier this year, to which the company strongly objected. The researcher announced his departure on his LinkedIn profile and on the Partnership on AI website , where he still serves on the board of directors. MIT Tech Review described Candela being forced into an impossible situation of fixing AI at Facebook after he helped build a lot of the tools the company relied on. ""I am taking a break to fully support my wife with rebuilding her career, and to enjoy our kids before they all leave the nest,"" the former distinguished technical lead wrote on LinkedIn. ""I recently resigned from Facebook after 9.5 amazing years in order to create the space I need."" In an earlier Facebook post, he said he was taking an ""internet sabbatical."" Facebook confirmed his departure and denied that it was related to the MIT Tech Review story. Candela worked on AI at Facebook for more than nine years, starting with advertising optimization using machine learning and ending his career at the company leading the Responsible AI team. He was critical in building Facebook's machine-learning pipeline , which was used to spin up new ML algorithms for projects around the company. He was also a part of the company's use of AI to monitor live videos streaming on Facebook. In 2016, Candela said he envisioned Facebook's video platform as a custom TV channel that would automatically show users live videos of what they were most interested in, based on their Facebook interactions. MIT Tech Review reported Candela had direct access to Mark Zuckerberg as a member of the Applied Machine Learning team, which sat in close proximity to the CEO. Zuckerberg also relied heavily on Candela's expertise in arranging the company's response to misinformation on the site, which it still struggles to contain. Sign up for notifications from Insider!

Among other tech-related subjects, the series has tackled artificial intelligence or AI. AI regulation has recently become the focus of discussion globally as AI is being rapidly deployed in various sectors.  A recent example is the use of AI by Moderna to speed up the development of the Covid-19 vaccine. While many countries are gearing up to roll out regulations on the use of AI, SA lags behind. The closest South Africa has come to regulating AI is in creating the Presidential Commission on the 4 th Industrial Revolution (4IR) in 2019, which recommended, among other things, establishing the National Artificial Intelligence Institute. Since a legally binding set of rules to govern AI is yet to be passed in South Africa, we have considered recent developments in the regulation of AI in the UK and the EU to determine whether South African regulators should follow their example. Regulatory developments on AI in the UK In June 2021, the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) (the UK’s watchdog in charge of upholding information rights and protecting personal information), published an opinion on the use of Live Facial Recognition Technology (LFRT).  LFRT collects biometric information, such as fingerprints, irises, or facial features of individuals, in real-time. The ICO’s opinion focuses on the applicability of data protection law to the use of LFRT. Data protection law applies to the processing of LFRT, given that it involves the processing of several types of personal data under the GDPR (the EU’s equivalent of POPIA, South Africa’s data protection law), including personal, biometric and criminal offence data. LFRT can be used for many purposes. At the time of publishing the opinion, the ICO had completed investigations into six examples of planned or actual use of LFRT in public places. The examples included the use of LFRT for surveillance, marketing and advertising. The opinion emphasises the ICO’s data protection concerns about the use of LFRT. These include: the automatic collection of biometric data at speed and scale without justification (in many examples, the organisation processing data could not show that the processing was necessary and proportionate to the purpose of the collection of the data); and the lack of choice or control by those people whose data was being collected. Other concerns raised by the ICO include the lack of transparency afforded to those people on how, when and why their data was being processed, as well as the potential for bias and discrimination.  (LFRT works with less precision for some demographic groups, including women, minority ethnic groups and disabled people, owing to design flaws or deficiencies in training data). To address its concerns, the ICO emphasised that organisations must ensure that their use of LFRT meets the requirements of lawfulness, fairness and transparency, and a robust evaluation of necessity and proportionality should be conducted. These requirements are based on GDPR principles, which are also present in POPIA. While the ICO set out these obligatory requirements for the lawful use of LFRT, it concluded that any investigation into the use of LFRT should be circumstance- and fact-specific. Regulatory developments on AI in the EU In April 2021, the EU Data Protection Board and EU Data Protection Supervisor published a joint opinion on the European Commission’s set of proposals for the introduction of harmonised rules on AI (Proposal). The purpose of the Proposal was to achieve legal certainty within the AI industry, to ensure that AI systems are safe and respect EU laws and values. However, the Board and Supervisor highlighted various concerns with the Proposal. These include: the exclusion of international law enforcement co-operation from the scope of the Proposal, which might risk circumvention by third party countries and international organisations using AI systems within the EU; and the need for clarification that the GDPR and the Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive (an EU directive on data protection and privacy in the digital age) shall apply to the use of AI Systems. While the Board and Supervisor welcomed the risk-based approach to AI adopted by the European Commission, they highlighted the need to ensure that AI systems, including those that do not involve the processing of personal data but still impact the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals, also fall within the scope of the Proposal. A further concern highlighted by the Board and Supervisor is that the Proposal requires the providers of AI systems to perform a risk assessment. However, in most cases, the controllers (as defined in the GDPR) or the responsible party (as defined in POPIA) will be the users, rather than the providers, of the AI systems. While it is clear from these two opinions that the UK and EU are still grappling with how to regulate AI, these opinions may provide South Africa’s regulators with a guideline on what may be important in a local data protection context in regulating AI. With the rapid growth in SA’s tech sector, the country is in in desperate need of AI regulation. After all, a Black Mirror-esque future may not be too far off.

This $177 million deal, which was initiated back in July, is aimed at expanding Omnicell’s Advanced Services portfolio. The acquisition particularly adds a comprehensive and differentiated suite of SaaS financial management, analytics, and population health solutions to Omnicell’s EnlivenHealth division. According to Omnicell, this acquisition will enable new clinical services and expand growth and profitability opportunities. The Acquisition and Strategic Synergies Omnicell’s EnlivenHealth provides patient engagement solutions for retail pharmacies and health plans. It targets to provide advanced digital solutions to measurably improve patient health outcomes and also drive growth and profitability. The ongoing pandemic situation has accelerated some major healthcare trends like digitizing care delivery including telehealth and shifting the point of care to a broader range of settings, including innovative hospital-at-home programs and local pharmacies. According to Omnicell, in such a situation, the FDS Amplicare acquisition is expected to enable it and its EnlivenHealth division to gain from the industry-wide trends, banking on comprehensive offerings of digital technologies, SaaS solutions, and tech-enabled services. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The acquisition of FDS Amplicare’s differentiated financial management, analytics, and population health solutions, along with its nationwide network of more than 15,000 independent retail pharmacies has broadened EnlivenHealth’s industry footprint. Further, Omnicell noted that at present Direct & Indirect Remuneration (DIR) fees continue to challenge the business health of the retail pharmacy industry, especially independent pharmacies. FDS Amplicare’s offerings are playing a crucial role in helping retail pharmacies manage, forecast, and mitigate their DIR fee exposure. Omnicell claims that when combined with EnlivenHealth’s clinical and data science capabilities, this differentiated, multi-pronged offering will enable retail pharmacies to bend the DIR growth curve. Favorable Industry Trend Going by an imarc report , the global patient engagement solutions market exhibited strong growth during 2015-2020. The market is expected to witness a CAGR of around 13% during 2021-2026. Looking at this market’s huge growth potential, we believe the latest acquisition of FDS Amplicare to be well-timed. Notable Developments On Sep 7, 2021, Omnicell announced the opening of a new software development center through its subsidiary based in Bangalore, India. The company’s new center will focus on product innovation to advance its strategy to deliver the cloud-based infrastructure in order to support the Autonomous Pharmacy. This new center is likely to expand the company’s cloud-based solutions portfolio. In August 2021, Omnicell announced the latest enhancements to its industry-leading portfolio of medication management solutions. These new capabilities, included in the company’s Summer 2021 Release, focus on superior customer experience and innovation to drive maximum value sooner; and deliver improved workflow efficiency, expanded automation, and enhanced medication management intelligence. In July 2021, Omnicell’s long-time partner Spartanburg Regional Healthcare System selected the company’s medication management platform to enhance efficiency, control, and safety across the care continuum. Through this collaboration, Omnicell’s Central Pharmacy Dispensing and IV Compounding Services will aid Spartanburg Regional in its journey toward zero-error medication management and the fully autonomous pharmacy. Share Price Performance The stock has outperformed its industry over the past year. It has rallied 116.4% against the industry’s 15.4% decline. Zacks Rank and Other Key Picks Currently, Omnicell carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Why its days are numbered. R.I.P Covid! It's the new silver bullet, the next best thing since the vaccine PALO ALTO, Calif. (PRWEB) September 13, 2021 Qare Inc., today announced the launch of ASGARD™, the first, comprehensive, cloud-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) solution that removes all barriers to safely return to work post-Covid-19. Using the AI software, all organizations, from large enterprises to small businesses and schools to health care providers, can fully verify, track and manage vaccinations to prevent, control and mitigate Covid-19 in the workplace. Employees of these institutions no longer need to fear Covid-19 and can now safely return to work and live life as it was meant to be. Even with tremendous progress in vaccinations, an unbiased examination of the data will reveal that there is still much reason to fear in the here and now. There are more weekly infections now than at any other time since the start of the pandemic, excepting the peak period of Dec and Jan. As travel and mask restrictions are removed, newer and more deadly strains are popping up. Studies based on scientific research have shown that no amount of hygiene theater or workplace re-engineering can fully prevent the airborne transmission of Covid-19, particularly in indoor spaces. There is certainly a risk of contagion indoors and the valid concerns of workers about workplace safety is not being heard. Below citations are from just two of many such studies: Study I: https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/71/9/2311/5867798 Study II: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-16/covid-is-airborne-scientists-say-now-authorities-think-so-too Qare Inc. saw this coming and put data/smarts to work. Qare's AI solution ASGARD™ automatically collects and processes consent-based employee health data from smart health cards to verify vaccination and track Covid-19 risk dynamically at each location with pinpoint accuracy. And prevention and control measures can be initiated in real-time with highly granular access control measures. Says Kate Beckett, an early Beta customer from a midsize business, ""It's the new silver bullet, the next best thing since the vaccine. So now, we can be sure of an infection free work environment, instead of merely wishing or hoping for one"". Just as President Joe Biden is unveiling new vaccine mandates to combat Covid-19 and save lives, Qare Inc. has come up with the perfect new advanced AI solution to implement it. Qare's ASGARD™ can verify, track, monitor and manage vaccinations automatically with a touch-free workflow as well as intelligently control risks and mitigate vulnerabilities. However, this tool was not opportunely conceived overnight, but is a product of meticulous research and development for well over a year.

If you have heard the crackle of stale, yellow grass beneath your feet this summer, you’re not alone. Nearly 100% of Oregon is currently in severe drought, according to the United States Drought Monitor . Since 2015 Oregon has experienced drought each and every summer, the severity of which continues to increase as global temperatures rise. Gov. Brown has responded to Oregon’s drought by ordering government agencies to stop watering lawns. Large institutions like Oregon State University have also cut back on water consumption by installing low-flow faucets and toilets; watching water-meter usage to spot leaks; and installing rainwater-catch basins in newer buildings and an irrigation control system across campus to measure humidity, temperature and evaporation rate. “All Oregon State University employees and students can contribute by conserving the state’s dwindling water supply within the operation of our campuses, centers and offices,” said OSU Interim President Becky Johnson in a prepared statement. “At the same time, OSU researchers are engaged in efforts to understand and address the many impacts of the drought and ensuing wildfires, and OSU Extension agents are providing support in communities experiencing hardships.” Oregon’s drought issues are only going to get worse as time goes on. Sophisticated irrigation technologies and predictive analytics could mean the difference between Oregonians merely feeling annoyed during the summer months or feeling the pain of ecological and economic collapse. Not only is drought murder on lawns, it’s incredibly costly. An estimate from the National Center for Environmental Information found drought cost $9 billion for businesses every year. Oregon farmers and ranchers have a particularly difficult time with drought. Not only do these businesses depend on water consumption to produce output, but farm workers are less able to function in the heat. Livestock also need to drink more water and spend more time in cooling stations when temperatures are high. Dave Mackie, CEO of Austin-based startup Olea Edge Analytics, says water management is spurring an arms race of aqua-tech. Using sensors, artificial intelligence and predictive algorithms, Olea Edge hopes to make a splash in Portland and other cities losing money on drought. According to Mackie, cities lose 20% to 30% of their water on average due to runoff, leakage and other maintenance issues resulting from use. While his technology doesn’t create more water, the process — called Hydraulic Modeling — monitors and adapts quickly to leaks and stuck turbines, and predicts future problems using AI. The process could save cities and companies millions of dollars in water bills and increased production. A city water meter hooked up to an Olea Edge Analytics sneson. Photo: Olea Edge Analytics . “We’re computerizing what hasn’t been computerized before,” says Mackie. “The majority of the meters we install are for predictive technology. We identify problems that are going to be there and fix them effectively.” Just like a leaky faucet or a drip under the kitchen sink, water-loss issues are usually not identified until they have already caused a significant amount of damage. Mackie estimates a city like Portland could save 3 billion gallons of water each year. For reference, the city consumes approximately 8.7 billion gallons annually. The system is also doubly sustainable, as it runs off solar power. RELATED STORY: Robots on the Farm In the meantime, Oregon universities are taking their own steps to conserve water. This year 13 researchers from OSU’s College of Engineering — in partnership with the University of Washington — are participating in AgAID , a $20 million federal effort to develop artificial intelligence to address farming’s biggest problems, including diminishing water supplies caused by climate change. One thing OSU’s program and Olea Analytics has in common? Big data. “We are bringing in algorithms and data science as part of the puzzle,” says Alan Fern, professor of computer science and lead investigator representing Oregon State. “Water management is one of the most significant thrusts. A lot of it is setting up good data pipelines for what is there.” To subscribe to Oregon Business , click here .

Video Azure Visual Studio Visual Studio Code Blazor/ASP.NET .NET C#/VB/TypeScript Xamarin/Mobile AI/Machine Learning News New Open Source ONNX Runtime Web Does Machine Learning Modeling in Browser By David Ramel 09/13/2021 Microsoft introduced  a new feature for the open source ONNX Runtime machine learning model accelerator for running JavaScript-based ML models running in browsers. The new ONNX Runtime Web (ORT Web) was introduced this month as a new feature for the cross-platform ONNX Runtime used to optimize and accelerate ML inferencing and training. It's all part of the ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) ecosystem that serves as an open standard for ML interoperability. Microsoft says ONNX Runtime inference can enable faster customer experiences and lower costs, as it supports models from deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow/Keras along with classical ML libraries like scikit-learn, LightGBM, XGBoost and more. It's compatible with different hardware, drivers and OSes, providing optimal performance by leveraging hardware accelerators where applicable, alongside graph optimizations and transforms. The JavaScript-based ORT Web for the ONNX Runtime isn't a brand-new product, however, as it replaces Microsoft's ONNX.js Javascript library for running ONNX models on browsers and on Node.js, supposedly providing an enhanced user experience and improved performance. Specifically, the new tool is said to provide a more consistent developer experience between packages for server-side and client-side inferencing, along with improved inference performance and model coverage. Key to all that is a two-pronged back-end approach to accelerate model inference in the browser with the help of both machine CPUs and their graphics-oriented GPU counterparts. That involves WebAssembly back-end functionality on the CPU side (it lets C++ code be used in the browser instead of JavaScript), whereas the GPU side of things leverages WebGL, a popular standard for accessing GPU capabilities. [Click on image for larger view.] ORT Web Overview (source: Microsoft). ""Running machine-learning-powered web applications in browsers has drawn a lot of attention from the AI community,"" Microsoft said in an announcement early this month. ""It is challenging to make native AI applications portable to multiple platforms given the variations in programming languages and deployment environments. Web applications can easily enable cross-platform portability with the same implementation through the browser. Additionally, running machine learning models in browsers can accelerate performance by reducing server-client communications and simplify the distribution experience without needing any additional libraries and driver installations."" Microsoft is soliciting developer feedback on the project, which can be provided on the ONNX Runtime GitHub repo . As it continues to work on and improve the tool's performance and model coverage and introduce new features, one possible enhancement being considered is on-device model training.

Share Article A patient receiving radiation therapy. Credit: Mark Kostich / Getty Images Need to Know: GlobalData’s proprietary model uses a combination of machine learning and an algorithm to calculate an individual drug’s Phase Transition Success Rate (PTSR) and Likelihood of Approval (LoA). While LoA provides the probability of a drug ultimately receiving market authorization, PTSR indicates the probability of a drug’s advancement to the next stage of clinical development. The model uses data points from the individual drugs, clinical trials, regulatory milestones, company, and financial databases. Ology’s cervical, vaginal cancer asset bolstered after suspended Phase III resumes Ology Bioservices’ cervical and vaginal cancer asset NTO-1151 (triapine) saw its LoA jump after its suspended Phase III trial resumed recruitment. Triapine’s LoA increased by 24 points to 43% in cervical cancer and 23 points to 47% in vaginal cancer. The LoA changed on 6 September after the Phase III trial’s ClinicalTrials.gov entry was updated on 2 September. The 450-patient trial was suspended on 1 June due to drug supply issues. Triapine inhibits ribonucleoside reductase; it blocks enzymes relevant for tumor cell growth. The Phase III is combining triapine with cisplatin chemotherapy during radiation therapy. It has a primary endpoint of overall survival within a five-year timeframe. MaxCyte focus shift negatively impacts Phase I ovarian cancer asset MaxCyte’s mesothelin-targeting chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) therapy MCY-M11 had its PTSR plummet in fallopian tube, ovarian, and peritoneal cancers. This is on the back of a Phase I basket trial termination. MCY-M11’s PTSR dived by 26 points to 31% in fallopian tube cancer, 24 points to 27% in ovarian cancer, and 27 points to 31% in peritoneal cancer. The PTSR update occurred on 6 September. On 30 August, the Phase I trial’s ClinicalTrials.gov listing was updated to state the trial was terminated due to MaxCyte shifting its focus. The trial was anticipated to enrol 27 patients when it started recruiting in August 2018 but accrued only 14 participants. The dose-escalation study was designed to investigate MCY-M11’s feasibility, safety, and tolerability. It recruited patients with recurrence after prior chemotherapy, administering MCY-M11 as an intraperitoneal infusion for three weekly doses. MCY-M11 is an mRNA-based anti-mesothelin CAR-PBMC cell therapy manufactured using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Its LoA also dropped to 1% in all three indications. Takeda’s Ninlaro in hematologic cancers boosted by positive Phase II data Takeda Pharmaceutical’s Ninlaro (ixazomib) had its PTSR jump in several hematologic cancers on the back of a Phase II basket trial data reveal. Its PTSR jumped by 23 points to 48% in chronic myelogenous leukemia, 19 points to 50% in acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and 17 points to 39% in Hodgkin’s lymphoma, as of 3 September. The next day, it also had an 8-point increase to 14% in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Results from the investigator-led Phase II trial were posted on ClinicalTrials.gov on 1 September. In the primary endpoint, 10 out of 25 patients (40%) relapsed or progressed at one-year post-treatment. Patients first undergo stem cell transplant (haploidentical transplantation) with a conditioning regimen of chemotherapy and radiation treatment. After which, patients were given Ninlaro weekly for three weeks, every 28-day cycle up to 12 cycles. Ninlaro is a proteasome inhibitor. It garnered FDA approval on November 2015 in combination with two other therapies in multiple myeloma patients who received at least one prior therapy. Ninlaro’s LoA also jumped by 7 to 8 points in all four hematologic cancers, with ALL having the highest LoA at 21% and CLL the lowest at 12%. Pliant’s fibrotic lung disease asset transition to next trial rise by five points Pliant Therapeutics’ PLN-74809 saw its PTSR in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) rise five points to 40% following the release of positive interim Phase IIa results. The PTSR change went live on 9 September, two days after Phase IIa data was reported (7 September). The 12-patient Phase IIa uses PET scans to evaluate the target engagement of four PLN-74809 dose levels in patients with mild or moderate IPF, the trial’s primary endpoint. All patients achieved more than 50% target engagement, which a previous study established as a benchmark for a predicted clinical antifibrotic effect. Stanford University is listed as a collaborator. PLN-74809 is a dual selective inhibitor of integrin beta 6/integrin beta 1, with the Phase IIa using an integrin beta 6 PET ligand to evaluate target engagement. The trial data also resulted in a two-point bump to PLN-74809’s LoA, which rose to 14%.

The vInsight platform also includes the vInsight™ Developer tool, which enables customers to create AI-based VHM algorithms, and the vInsight™ Edge embedded inferencing engine, which enables efficient execution of vehicle health monitors onboard the vehicle. Fleet operational efficiency is impacted by multiple factors including vehicle health conditions, driver behavior, drive cycle, mission planning, and more. Although ample data is available today to fleet managers, the complex relationships between these factors make it difficult to identify, isolate, and prioritize the contributing factors and drive effective actions. Generating actionable insights often requires manual analysis of reports by experienced individuals, which delivers limited results. Existing fleet management solutions use telematics data to track each vehicle’s location, fuel use, engine status, and driver behavior to make sure that rules are followed and best practices are kept. They also interpret diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs) to initiate repairs and create maintenance reminders based on mileage and hours of service. These capabilities are primarily reactive and inefficiently preventative. vInsight Fleet uses state-of-the art machine learning and deep learning technology to learn the complex relationships between multiple contributing factors within the vehicle and across the fleet by utilizing telematics data and vehicle health indicators that are proactively generated by the vInsight platform. The AI identifies and isolates factors that impact operational efficiency, fuel consumption, and maintenance costs. SafeRide’s AI technology advances fleet management with predictive capabilities and operational insights that were not available before. It helps reduce maintenance costs, minimize diagnostic and repair time, optimize fuel consumption, mitigate roadside repairs, and minimize downtime. SafeRide also announced today a partnership with Traffilog , a leading provider of telematics, advanced diagnostics, and predictive maintenance services for commercial fleets. Traffilog will integrate SafeRide’s new solution to provide its fleet customers cutting-edge advancements in predictive maintenance and fleet operational efficiency. ”Traffilog’s advanced telematics and data acquisition capabilities provide access to valuable vehicle data”, said Yossi Vardi, SafeRide’s CEO and Co-Founder. “Integrating SafeRide’s deep learning and big data analytics technology together with Traffilog’s platform enables us to deliver best-in-class diagnostics and predictive maintenance services to commercial fleets worldwide.” “SafeRide’s deep learning technology enables us to further increase the value we deliver to our fleet customers”, said Erez Lorber, CEO of Traffilog. “Integrating vInsight Fleet into our platform provides our customers with unprecedented capabilities to optimize their fleet’s performance and reduce their vehicles’ total cost of ownership.” vInsight Fleet integrates with telematics and fleet management solutions using open APIs, which enable the use of data from multiple sources and the delivery of insights to each fleet’s preferred management system. The vInsight Fleet software can run on public or private cloud or on premises. SafeRide is demonstrating the vInsight Fleet solution this week at the American Trucking Association’s Technology and Maintenance Council Fall Meeting in Cleveland, Ohio.

Continuing the mission of educating and empowering Bay Area youth, 49ers EDU presented by Chevron has announced a new partnership with SAP. Driven by a shared vision of increasing awareness and interest in data science and technology career paths, the two global brands will collaborate on a series of initiatives that will integrate such topics into the 49ers EDU curriculum. SAP first joined the 49ers family in 2014 by signing on as a corporate partner and Official Business Solutions Provider and Analytics Partner. Then in 2018, the organizations partnered to unveil the Executive Huddle, a first-of-its-kind venue management system providing real-time data visualizations spanning multiple data sources. The suite allows the 49ers business strategy and analytics team to monitor and respond to certain operational areas on major event days at Levi's Stadium, including NFL gamedays, concerts, international soccer fixtures, and more. Now, after three years of intensive planning, the 49ers and SAP are using Executive Huddle to not only improve the fan experience, but grow the next generation of STEAM professionals. The Executive Huddle and SAP will be integrated into the 49ers EDU Virtual Lesson Series with a dedicated lesson on data science and analytics, including math vocabulary and concepts frequently used by company employees. Capable of being adjusted to fit accordingly with K-8 academics, the Virtual Lesson Series features other lessons covering art, math, environmental sustainability, and career path exploration. An extension of the program's in-person offerings, the Virtual Lesson Series brings the Levi's® Stadium field trip experience directly to students in a distance learning format via remote teaching and instruction. SAP will also provide company personnel as guest speakers to further explain the material and provide examples of what data science jobs can look like. Once registering for the 49ers EDU Virtual Lesson featuring SAP, educators will receive a recorded introductory video, setting the stage for their scheduled live Virtual Lesson. This video will also be made available on-demand as a way for students and families to learn about math and data science in a condensed manner that fits their schedule. ""We have one of the best tools in the world to visualize data science, so we think it makes perfect sense to partner with SAP and use the Executive Huddle to teach students how important, and fun, these topics really are,"" said Jesse Lovejoy, Director of 49ers EDU. ""Having support from such a well-known partner like SAP really helps with creating material that will be respected and compelling for learners across the region. Upon resumption, the 49ers EDU STEAM Education Field Trip Program will expand by opening high school registration for the first time. High school programming will take students directly to the Executive Huddle suite at the stadium, where they will partake in educational activities mimicking data science scenarios that 49ers executives might see on gamedays. For all field trips to the Executive Huddle, a 49ers and/or SAP employee will be present to share first-hand experience using the technology. ""SAP is committed to building the digital skills of the next generation,"" says Max Wessel, Chief Learning Officer of SAP. ""By partnering with 49ers EDU to design a curriculum that inspires exploration of data science and analytics, we hope to create opportunity for all learners – no matter their future career paths."" Earlier this year, the 49ers and SAP also partnered to join the Data Science for Everyone coalition . By joining industry leaders, schools, universities, policymakers, funders, and individuals, the two brands committed to elevating the importance of data literacy through their work.

Automatic live transcriptions / closed captions in English were announced to be coming to free Zoom accounts in February 2021 . Now Zoom says it “plans to provide real-time transcription for (as many as 30 additional languages) by the end of next year.” As part of that push, Zoom will also offer translation services for paid accounts, with the plan “to support real-time translation across as many as 12 languages by the end of next year.” Zoom wasn’t able to share details about which languages will be supported and when, but did say these improvements are a direct result of the machine learning know-how it gained by acquiring German translation company Kites . Zoom Whiteboard, as accessed through the Zoom app. Image: Zoom The other major change is coming to Zoom’s whiteboard feature. Zoom currently lets you create and share whiteboards during meetings to doodle together while you talk, but a planned expansion launching in beta later this year will make Zoom Whiteboard available outside of meetings in Zoom apps and the web. The basic drawing tools don’t appear to be different from what Zoom currently offers, the main change is how Zoom is treating Whiteboard as a product alongside video calls, rather than a feature that lives inside of them. You’ll be able to add sticky notes, drawings, and comments on your boards and view them whenever you want. A meeting in Horizon Workrooms. Image: Facebook Early next year, Zoom is coming to Facebook’s Horizon Workrooms . The shared VR meeting space will be able to host video meetings and connect to Zoom Whiteboard, according to Zoom. In VR, you can pin a Zoom Whiteboard to your virtual desk or to the wall for everyone to see, and draw along with colleagues attending a meeting through a traditional computer. The Zoom Widget.

Innovation I am a Forbes Fellow writing for the Health & Science vertical. Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Aoi Senju Colabra Colabra - a company working to provide scientists a platform to share research and other data with each other - announced Monday that it has raised $1.5 million from an oversubscribed pre-seed funding round. Investors in the round include Village Global, Longtail Health Ventures, Builders VC, BoxOne Ventures, and others. The San Francisco-based company was established to help bring the scientific method to a digital space by offering scientists a platform where they can look at the work of other scientists on their teams. Its platform enables scientists to comment on experiments, track work being done and integrate DNA sequences, molecular structures and microscopic images. “Scientists are able to build on the work of others, instead of trying to find all of this data,” cofounder and CEO Aoi Senju says. The idea of Colabra came into fruition after Senju met his fellow cofounder Philip Seifi at a Launch House event last October, which is a residency program where entrepreneurs network. At the event, the two were paired as roommates and after getting to know each other and participating in hackathons together, they realized they worked well together. They enjoyed that partnership so much that by the end of their time at the event, the duo was already entertaining the idea of starting a company. Before shifting his focus into software and data science, Senju had studied chemical engineering. As he learned more about data science, he found that practices such as “code review and agile project management” were missing from the scientific field. That inspiration is what  led to the company being founded in January 2021. “The basis of Colabra was to take many of the best practices that exist in other fields and bring it into scientific research in a familiar format,” Senju says. “There’s a massive problem in science today of redundant work - experiments have already been done or dead ends that other people have run up against.” Matthew De Silva, syndicate lead and angel investor for Longtail Health Ventures, has seen scientists use various solutions to effectively conduct and analyze experiments at his California-based company Notable Labs - that finds the most effective treatment to specific cancers. “We've had folks try traditional paper lab notebooks, general-purpose tools like Evernote, and enterprise-grade lab notebooks like Benchling,” De Silva says. “When I was introduced to Colabra and met Aoi and Philip, their product felt novel — it was the first time I'd seen a clean, powerful, intuitive, tool purpose-built for day-to-day scientific work.” MORE FOR YOU Russian Telecom Operator MTS Launches $100 Million Venture Fund ‘This Is Europe’s Moment’: Lightspeed Venture Partners Hires Paul Murphy To Lead Europe Push This Startup Just Raised $6 Million For An App That Helps Treat Addiction “As a scientist and entrepreneur, I've experienced firsthand the lack of tools designed for scientists when trying to plan, execute, and analyze experiments,” Milad Alucozai, Head of Bio & Deep Tech at BoxOne Ventures. “I see Colabra becoming the go-to collaboration and data integration platform for scientists.” Currently the company is in closed beta with the intention to publicly release the product in late October. “Within the first week of launching their private beta, Colabra was getting feedback from  their scientists, telling the team how much further they'd be in their research if Colabra had existed years ago,” partner at Village Global, Anne Dwane says. The market for electronic lab notebooks has seen growth as the field becomes digital - leading to an increase in need for faster, more accurate results. The market size last year was reportedly over $550 million, according to Verified Market Research . With its seed funding in place, the company looks to grow its engineering team. In doing so, the company plans to be better equipped to add more features to the platform as well as better meet the needs of clients. The company will be looking to integrate with companies such as Slack, Trello and Asana to improve its project management software. “In the future we want to aggregate scientific data, not only to come up with meaningful conclusions from the experiments themselves, but to derive deeper insights that the scientist would have otherwise missed in the past,” Senju says. “And what we see with Colabra is enabling… scientific organizations to leverage and build on the brainpower of every scientist at that organization” Jair Hilburn Print Reprints & Permissions"

Read for deep dives into the unmissable ideas and topics shaping our world. Sponsored by Sep 13, 2021 TODAY It’s here. On our streets and in our neighborhoods. From traffic control to CCTVs to water-monitoring systems , artificial intelligence and machine-learning technologies are already among us. But, as the song goes, you ain’t seen nothin’ yet. Many argue that smart technology is making our cities safer, with facial detection able to spot and locate wanted criminals or people who violate public health restrictions. Others believe the presence of near ubiquitous CCTV cameras on the streets of many modern cities, from London to Beijing, amounts to intrusion on a massive scale. Either way, the role played by AI in shaping our urban environments is only going to grow and spread. In today’s Daily Dose, we look at global cities that are offering us an early glimpse of what the future might look like. Listen Toyloy Brown III and Stephen Starr dubai and abu dhabi: safer streets 1 - Put on Your Mask! In Dubai, United Arab Emirates, if you’re not wearing a mask and hear a low buzzing noise above your head, chances are you’re in trouble with the law. Police in the city have been using drones equipped with facial recognition capabilities and loudspeakers to dissuade locals from congregating in large numbers amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The drones reportedly detected 4,400 criminal violations, including 518 instances of people not wearing a mask, in the first three months of 2021. Among the other criminal activities recorded were sales of contraband goods, allowing law enforcement officers to make arrests without having to spend too much time patrolling some of the world’s hottest streets. 2 - ‘Emotion Recognition’ As a global crossroads for travel and trade of both legal and illicit stripes, border police in Abu Dhabi, Dubai’s neighboring city, face huge challenges in finding and stopping drug traffickers. But in November, three men were arrested for trafficking 100 pounds of heroin using Minority Report levels of AI. While details of the exact technologies used appear to be under wraps, “The dealers were caught using advanced policing techniques, including crime prediction and emotion recognition,” reports The National . The police force’s so-called Ghost AI system is also being deployed across the city in an attempt to predict what types of crimes will take place when and where. 3 - Police Cars With Facial Recognition Last year, Abu Dhabi equipped its already outlandish fleet of law enforcement vehicles with live biometric facial recognition systems , according to news reports. How does it work? A “smart bar” attached to the roof of a police car can identify the faces of known criminals, then interact with the city’s central police command system to check for outstanding warrants. But will the mass-tracing campaign impinge on the civil liberties of citizens? The UAE already has a questionable human rights record. Deploying AI in the law enforcement sphere could add to those concerns. real talk, real change It’s time for #RealTalkRealChange . OZY and Chevrolet are teaming up for a thought-provoking discussion on the generational wealth gap. The growing income divide, shaped by centuries of policies, has systematically disadvantaged Black Americans when it comes to wealth. How do we close the gap?

Put aside the shouting matches and talking heads and be an ally: Join us now for a real conversation you won’t want to miss. Learn More shenzhen: predicting pollution 1 - The Cost of Air Pollution It kills 7 million people around the globe every year. An estimated 1.24 million of those deaths occur in China , mainly in major cities. The huge growth in urban development across swaths of eastern and southern China has contributed enormously to the ill health not just of its residents, but also to the residents of other Asian countries. While air-monitoring systems have been around for years, China has been accused of misreporting air quality . 2 - Predicting Bad Air So what’s the solution? At the U.K.’s Loughborough University, researchers have built a program that can predict unhealthy levels of particulate smog in the air within hours by forecasting pollution events and their expected severity. Such advance notice is an urgent matter for vulnerable populations, with research showing that everything from coughs to cancer could begin with the ingestion of particulate matter. With the global urban population set to grow from 55% to 68% by 2030 , this technology could well be the canary in our planet’s coal mine. 3 - To Shenzhen Scientists who initially used air pollution levels in Beijing to “train” smog-monitoring AI are now looking at another Chinese city 1,300 miles to the south — Shenzhen — to see if it can be rolled out on a major scale. A coastal city of 13 million people, Shenzhen has suffered bad air for decades, though in recent years the city has tried to clean up its act . As the city that spearheaded China’s economic drive four decades ago, Shenzhen is set to lead the country again. Read More markham, ontario: spot that hole 1 - Pothole Predicaments As a suburb of Toronto, the fourth-largest city in North America, Markham’s roads see their fair share of vehicular traffic on top of winter wear and tear. The local climate — a freeze-thaw swing that occurs dozens of times each winter — is particularly damaging to roads and fuels a major pothole problem. Across the country, subpar road infrastructure costs motorists an estimated $2.4 billion every year in vehicle repairs and maintenance. Markham, with 343,000 people and with 684 miles of roads, has deployed artificial intelligence to locate potholes before they get bigger — and costlier to repair. 2 - The Solution The City of Markham created an AI-driven fix called ROVER. Cameras are attached to municipal vehicles. Potholes are identified and mapped using GPS. Not having to stop and mark each missing chunk of road or pavement by hand saves time, the City of Markham’s Alice Lam tells the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation , adding, “It also eliminates human error.” 3 - The Result The technology, now developed as an app, has increased pothole detection rates by 200% to 400%. After the succes of the pilot project, ROVER is now being used in five vehicles. With it gaining recognition among North America’s more clever infrastructure advances, you can expect to see similar efforts on your own streets in the near future. And that, for car and driver alike, can’t come soon enough. barcelona: artificial intelligence for all 1 - The Ethical Way In a place where AI and la bona vida are set to collide, city authorities in Barcelona are putting together a plan for machine learning that supports their own management needs while simultaneously respecting citizens’ digital rights . Spain’s second city is constructing an open source, public access AI system that makes available all algorithms that impact or involve its 1.6 million residents. To monitor beach occupancy amid the COVID-19 pandemic last summer, for instance, the city deployed thermal imaging systems instead of using controversial facial recognition systems. And instead of counting the number of people hitting the beaches, it estimates the total area of sand that is absent of people. 2 - Learning to Be Diverse You might not be surprised to hear that AI as a field lacks diversity . Women make up just 15% of AI researchers at Facebook and 10% at Google. Barcelona’s leading the way in trying to make the field more representative by making machine-learning tools available to anyone through an initiative called Saturdays.AI. Barcelona-based developer Jan Carbonell co-founded the company, which now offers educational programs in dozens of cities around the globe. 3 - Heavy Hitters Are Taking Note If you’re a country trying to level up in the AI playing field, it helps if you can pique the interest of giants. After Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez traveled to the West Coast of the United States and met with Apple CEO Tim Cook in July, it looks like the one-on-one time has paid off. Apple is set to expand its existing AI investment in Barcelona. The tech conglomerate has reportedly acquired a Barcelona-based AI company, Vilynx , which has created technology that could potentially be applied to Siri, Apple’s virtual assistant. Vilynx has made major advances in analyzing the audio, text and visual components of videos to identify their content. the global city: racist? 1 - Profiling For all its advantages, AI has a credibility problem and for good reason: It’s been shown to misidentify people of color. According to a 2019 study by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology, a plethora of top facial recognition algorithms suffer major inaccuracies when attempting to identify people based on characteristics such as race, ethnicity and age. Some systems deployed in the U.S. report a rate of misidentifying Black people five to 10 times more often than white people. In July, a Black teen in suburban Detroit was barred from a roller-skating rink after being misidentified by facial recognition software. And in January 2020 in Farmington Hills, Michigan, Robert Julian-Borchak Williams was incorrectly flagged by facial recognition technology as a shoplifting suspect and detained for 30 hours. 2 - ShotSpotter: Nothing to See Here, Folks ShotSpotter, a gunshot detection system that uses microphones in public spaces to locate and notify law enforcement officers of gunfire, has recently drawn its own fire. The system, used in dozens of cities across the U.S., has become known for frequent inaccuracies. In Chicago, 86% of ShotSpotter-prompted “gunfire” deployments turned out to be wild goose chases. More than 40,000 “dead-end deployments” to shooting alerts were registered between July 2019 and mid-April of this year. Activists argue that such tech tools are ineffective shortcuts rather than long-term changes that will reduce gun violence. 3 - The Answer Is Inclusion There’s a reason AI-based surveillance tech is often racially biased: It’s built on data drawn from discriminatory systems. It’s replete with systemic racism , even when it comes to something as simple as soap and hand sanitizer dispensers that darker-skinned hands don’t activate . Yet there are potential solutions. One is to establish inclusive AI design in which algorithms are actually tested on people from various races, cultures and genders. And another is to be aware of implicit bias that could be creeping into the algorithm. More on OZY Follow OZY on Twitter Why was there so little resistance when Afghanistan collapsed?

Martech startup Marpipe automates digital ad testing to tell marketers which are most effective. It just raised $8 million in Series A for a total of $10 million. The company shared the pitch deck it used to attract investors like Samsung and Math Capital. See more stories on Insider's business page . Marketing technology startup Marpipe just announced an $8 million Series A funding round for a total of $10 million raised to date. Part of the fast-growing creative software space, Marpipe automates the testing of hundreds of variations on Facebook and Instagram ads to tell marketers which are most effective. Founder and CEO Dan Pantelo said in his experience, around 90% of social media ad campaigns are shut down after one week or less due to underperformance. He said the ads' content is the biggest factor in their success but agency creatives often lack the data that could help them determine which version of an ad will perform best. ""Everything we do benefits from data science and automation except creative, which is the most important part of the whole puzzle,"" Pantelo said. ""It doesn't matter what creatives or clients think looks good; all that matters is what consumers want to see and hear from us."" Pantelo said he initially approached several ad-focused VC funds like Math Capital, which came together on a pre-seed round. The latest fundraising round was part of Marpipe's effort to get out in front of a growing field that includes platforms like Smartly.io , Celtra , and VidMob . Below are key slides from the investor pitch deck Marpipe used to raise the Series A. Marpipe asks potential investors if any of their portfolio companies struggle to create effective ad campaigns. Marpipe Marpipe says its technology can help resolve the tension between marketers who want better ads and creatives who lack the tools to test their work at scale. Marpipe Marpipe's key selling point is the data collected from consumers' responses to hundreds of different ads. Marpipe After years of focusing on ad-buying and selling software, investors have begun pouring money into design platforms. Marpipe New data privacy regulations have created an opening for companies like Marpipe that focus on the ads themselves rather than targeting technology, said investor Brandon Hoffman of Samsung Next. Marpipe Creative software companies like Smartly.io and VidMob have raised millions and attracted M&A interest, but Marpipe says no clear leader has emerged. Marpipe The company works with Facebook and Instagram and wants to sign deals with other ad platforms like Adobe and The Trade Desk. Marpipe Marpipe's primary focus will be growing its engineering team. Marpipe The company plans to move into video and audio ads and expand its data services.

As demand for digital training solutions explodes, many learning technology companies are reporting 50 per cent growth in a market estimated to be worth $25B by 2025. LearnExperts will use this investment to accelerate their market lead within the sector. After 20 years working at technology companies such as Cognos, IBM, PTC, and Kinaxis, LearnExperts founder Sarah Sedgman decided in 2019 to leave the comforts of corporate life and fulfill a mission to disrupt the learning technology space. “Years ago, when I was head of course development, I received a call from the CEO who needed my help because we were acquiring customers and releasing new features quickly, but our training lagged six to nine months after product release, which meant we couldn’t train our customers fast enough to get immediate value from our software and we risked losing them as customers,” said Sedgman. While she was able to reengineer the course development process to ensure launch alongside the product release, which had a positive impact on customers, it was still a manual process and very time-consuming, taking months to develop the content and release the courses. Sedgman’s experiences led to the development of a digital course creation platform that automatically transforms existing content into a course. LearnExperts guides the user to create a complete course with best practices applied through proprietary artificial intelligence. Starting with existing content that wasn’t purpose-built for learning, the output is a consistent, ready-to-use course that looks just like an expert built it. LearnExperts cuts the time to create and launch a new course from months to days. Story continues “We saw the value in LearnExperts immediately and knew that we wanted to be the lead investor,” said Ryan Henry, Partner at Sand Hill North. “We look for innovative technology companies that are reshaping the future of work for the better. The LearnExperts platform saves course creators days of effort and empowers them to easily build high-quality consistent courses.” LearnExperts Secures Large Enterprise Customers within First Year When LearnExperts began demonstrations of the platform, the interest was overwhelming, and customers wanted the solution right away. Originally planning to bootstrap the business, Sedgman decided to accelerate and raise capital. Now, the company is backed by an oversubscribed investment round and achieving steady customer acquisition. “We were impressed by the team’s deep domain expertise coupled with a unique solution to address the challenge of developing content at a rapid pace,” said Kevin Madill, Investment Director, MaRS IAF. “We are excited to participate in this latest funding round, support the team, and be part of the LearnExperts journey.” “What I love about Sarah is her passion, her thought leadership and energy. What I love about her and her team is that they’ve done this before within large technology corporations,” said Julia Elvidge, board member for Capital Angel Network. “We are excited to support LearnExperts and believe they have the right solution at the right time to deliver differentiated value to large companies around the world.” “I have been selling software solutions for many years and when I met Sarah and her team, I saw a large opportunity for their platform to provide immediate value in an exploding market,” said Jim Brown, active Georgian Angel Network investor. “Their system is unique and their go to market strategy is strong, and I look forward to partnering alongside Sarah and her team with any advice needed.” “I want to thank the Canadian Investor Community, Invest Ottawa, and several industry experts for the tremendous support,” said Sedgman. “Our investors Sand Hill North, MaRS IAF, Capital Angel Network, Maple Leaf Angel Network, Georgian Angel Network and the independent investors are strategic, savvy investors and have already become great partners.” Learn more at LearnExperts.ai .

Machine learning is very effective for making predictions or calculating suggestions based on vast quantities of data, which is the trendiest topic in the tech sector right now. In this article, we will discuss the top 10 ML algorithms for newbies. What are machine learning algorithms? Any other algorithm in computer programming can be connected to a machine learning method. An ML algorithm is a data-driven process for developing a production-ready ML model. If you consider ML as a train that will get you to your destination, then ML algorithms are the engines that will get you there. The sort of ML algorithm that works best is determined by the business challenge at hand, the dataset’s structure, and the available resources. Types of Machine Learning Algorithms Supervised ML Algorithms Unsupervised ML Algorithms Reinforcement ML Algorithms Best ML Algorithms Decision Tree The decision tree is a decision-making aid that employs a tree-like graph or model of options, as well as their potential consequences, such as chance-event results, resource costs, and execution. Decision trees are the top pick for categorizing both categorical and continuous dependent variables since they are supervised learning algorithms. The population is divided into two or more homogenous datasets using the most significant features or independent variables in this technique. Principal Component Analysis When data contains several dimensions, dimension reduction methods are among the most essential algorithms in ML. Consider a dataset with “n” dimensions, such as a data profession list that works with financial data with features such as credit score, personal information, staff compensation, and so on. He or she may now utilize the dimensionality reduction approach to identify the relevant labels for creating the needed model, and PCA is the ideal algorithm for decreasing dimensions. Deep Learning Algorithms Deep learning algorithms are based on the neurological system of a person and are usually built on neural networks that have a lot of computing power. To execute certain tasks, all of these algorithms employ various forms of neural networks. Deep learning algorithms are frequently used in areas such as healthcare, entertainment, eCommerce, and advertising to training computers by learning from instances. Naive Bayes Classifier The occurrence of a selected feature in a class is unrelated to the appearance of any other feature, according to a Naive Bayes classifier. Even though one attribute is connected to the others, it considers all of them independent when computing the likelihood of a specific result. There are two sorts of probability in the model: Probability of each class Conditional Probability Both probabilities may be computed directly from training data, and the probability model can then be used to forecast fresh data using the Bayes Theorem. Ordinary Least Square Regression The least-square is the technique for doing linear regression in statistics. The traditional least-squares approach is to draw a clear line between an independent variable and a dependent variable, then compute the vertical distance between the spot and the line for each data set, and add them up. Linear Regression Linear regression describes the effect on the dependent variable when the independent variable is changed; as a result, the independent variable is referred to as the explained variable, and the dependent variable is referred to as the factor of interest. It depicts the relationship between an independent and a dependent variable, as well as predictions and estimates in continuous values. It may be used, for example, in the insurance industry to assess risk and determine the number of applications for users of various ages. Logistic Regression A useful statistical method for modeling a binomial output including one or more explanatory factors is logistic regression. It calculates the relationship between the categorical dependent variable and one or even more independent variables by using a logistic function to measure probabilities. The logistic regression algorithm works with discrete data and is ideally suited to classification models, where an event is categorized as 1 if it happens successfully and 0 if it does not. As a result, the likelihood of a given event occurring is calculated using the specified predictor factors. Support Vector Machines In SVM, a hyperplane is used to correctly divide the data points throughout the input variable space by their corresponding class, which is either 0 or 1. Essentially, the SVM method calculates the coefficients that result in a reasonable separation of the different classes through the hyperplane, with the margin referring to the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points. The line with the biggest margin, on the other hand, is the best hyperplane for separating the two classes. Clustering Algorithms Clustering is a data analysis method of finding meaningful data patterns, such as groupings of consumers based on their behavior or geography, because it is an unsupervised learning issue. Clustering algorithms relate to the job of grouping an assemblage of items in such a manner that each entity in the same group is more similar to each other than those in different groups. Gradient Boosting & AdaBoost When dealing with large amounts of data, boosting algorithms are employed to make very accurate predictions. It is an ensemble learning method that mixes the different susceptible and mediocre predictors to produce strong predictors or estimators by combining the predictive power of varied base estimators in order to improve resilience. Conclusion Machine learning algorithms assist automate manual processes to make our lives easier, from simple day-to-day operations to making systems smarter. Machine learning’s importance has increased even more, which is why eager data scientists and engineers are eager to acquire new approaches to improve their abilities.

Learn why this has hundreds of software teams building their applications in the cloud across multiple use cases and industries. Register here The Transform Technology Summits start October 13th with Low-Code/No Code: Enabling Enterprise Agility. Register now! Google today announced TensorFlow Similarity, a Python package designed to train similarity models with the company’s TensorFlow machine learning framework. Similarity models search for related items, for example finding similar-looking clothes and identifying currently playing songs. As Google explains, many similarity models are trained using a technique called contrastive learning. Contrastive learning, in turn, relies on clustering algorithms, which automatically identify patterns in data by operating on the theory that data points in groups should have similar features. Contrastive learning allows a model to project items into an “embedding space” when applied to a dataset, such that the distances between embeddings — mathematical representations of the items — are indicative of how similar the input examples are. Training with TensorFlow Similarity yields a space where the distance between similar items remains small while the distance between dissimilar items is large. For instance, training a similarity model on the Oxford-IIIT Pet dataset leads to clusters where similar-looking breeds are close by and cats and dogs are separated. Training similarity models Once a model is trained, TensorFlow Similarity builds an index that contains the embeddings of the various items to make them searchable. According to Google, the library enables searches over millions of indexed items, retrieving the top similar matches within a fraction of second. Moreover, TensorFlow Similarity can add an unlimited new number of classes to the index without having to retrain, instead computing only the embeddings for representative items of the new classes. While the initial release of the library is focused on providing components to build contrastive learning-based similarity models, Google says it’ll add support for additional types of models to TensorFlow Similarity in the future. “The ability to search for related items has many real world applications,” Google’s Elie Bursztein and Owen S. Vallis wrote in a blog post. “More generally, being able to quickly retrieve related items is a vital part of many core information systems such as multimedia searches, recommender systems, and clustering pipelines.” TensorFlow Similarity is available in open source via GitHub. In addition, Google has released a programming notebook with a tutorial on basic usage. The release of TensorFlow Similarity follows the launches of other TensorFlow extensions focused on particular kinds of models and use cases. In 2019, Google debuted TensorFlow Privacy , a library intended to make it easier for developers to train AI models with “strong privacy guarantees.” And last year, the company released an experimental module that tests the security of AI models.

(Photo Illustration by Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images Roku stock (NASDAQ NDAQ : ROKU) dropped almost 16% in the last one month and now trades at under $320 per share. The company’s shares tumbled following the Q2 2021 financial results in early August, as investors became concerned about a sequential dip in usage and a warning that margins will come under pressure as supply chain constraints and cost increases eat into its bottom-line performance for the next couple of quarters. Streaming hours in Q2 2021 were at 17.4 billion, marking a decrease of 1 billion hours from Q1 2021. This was mainly because of more people venturing out as the Covid-19 crisis seemed to be initially subsiding Q2, before the Delta variant surge brought many back to home confinement. After the results, a couple of analysts downgraded the target price for Roku. Initially the stock was also affected as Cathie Wood, the founder and CEO of ARK Investment Management PZN , sold Roku shares from ARK?s exchange-traded funds. Wood had off loaded half a million shares of Roku since the end of June 2021, with total sales amounting close to $239 million. This sale assumed significance as just a month before it, Wood had said that investors were making a mistake by selling so-called stay-at-home stocks like Roku. But, after the recent decline, will ROKU’s stock continue its downward trajectory over the coming weeks, or is a recovery in the stock more likely? According to the Trefis Machine Learning Engine, which identifies trends in a company’s stock price data for the last four years, returns for ROKU stock average more than 14% in the next one-month (21 trading days) period after experiencing a 16% fall over the previous one-month (21 trading days) period. Also, there is a 66.5% probability that the stock will give a positive return in the next one month. But how would these numbers change if you are interested in holding ROKU stock for a shorter or a longer time period? You can test the answer and many other combinations on the Trefis Machine Learning Engine to test ROKU stock chances of a rise after a fall and vice versa. You can test the chance of recovery over different time intervals of a quarter, month, or even just one day! MACHINE LEARNING ENGINE try it yourself: IF ROKU stock moved by -5% over five trading days, THEN over the next 21 trading days, ROKU stock moves an average of 10 percent. Also, there is a 56% chance that the stock will give positive return in the next one month following a 5% drop over the previous week. Roku stock Trefis Some Fun Scenarios, FAQs & Making Sense of ROKU Stock Movements: Question 1: Is the average return for Roku stock higher after a drop? MORE FOR YOU War With China? The Economic Factor That Could Trigger It These Are The ‘Altcoins’ Everyone Loves Right Now Is Ethereum’s DeFi Boom Setting Itself Up For DeFi Bust? Answer: Consider two situations, Case 1: Roku stock drops by -5% or more in a week Case 2: Roku stock rises by 5% or more in a week Is the average return for Roku stock higher over the subsequent month after Case 1 or Case 2? ROKU stock fares better after Case 1 , with an average return of 9.9% over the next month (21 trading days) under Case 1 (where the stock has just suffered a 5% loss over the previous week), versus, an average return of 7.8% for Case 2. In comparison, the S&P 500 has an average return of 3.1% over the next 21 trading days under Case 1, and an average return of just 0.5% for Case 2 as detailed in our dashboard that details the average return for the S&P 500 after a fall or rise . Try the Trefis machine learning engine above to see for yourself how Roku stock is likely to behave after any specific gain or loss over a period. Question 2: Does patience pay? Answer: If you buy and hold Roku stock, the expectation is over time the near-term fluctuations will cancel out, and the long-term positive trend will favor you - at least if the company is otherwise strong. Overall, according to data and Trefis machine learning engine’s calculations, patience absolutely pays for most stocks! For ROKU stock, the returns over the next N days after a -5% change over the last five trading days is detailed in the table below, along with the returns for the S&P500: Question 3: What about the average return after a rise if you wait for a while? Answer: The average return after a rise is understandably lower than after a fall as detailed in the previous question. Interestingly, though, if a stock has gained over the last few days, you would do better to avoid short-term bets for most stocks - although ROKU stock appears to be an exception to this general observation. ROKU’s returns over the next N days after a 5% change over the last five trading days is detailed in the table below, along with the returns for the S&P500: It’s pretty powerful to test the trend for yourself for Roku stock by changing the inputs in the charts above.

The impacts could be mitigated by module recycling, repair and reuse; however, previous studies of PV circularity omit the consideration of critical social factors. Here we used an agent-based model to integrate social aspects with techno-economic factors, which provides a more realistic assessment of the circularity potential for previously studied interventions that assesses additional interventions that cannot be analysed using techno-economic analysis alone. We also performed a global sensitivity analysis using a machine-learning metamodel. We show that to exclude social factors underestimates the effect of lower recycling prices on PV material circularity, which highlights the relevance of considering social factors in future studies. Interventions aimed at changing customer attitudes about used PV boost the reuse of modules, although used modules can only satisfy one-third of the US demand during 2020–2050, which suggests that reuse should be complemented by recycling. Download PDF Main Soaring global deployment of solar photovoltaics (PV) could mitigate problems related to energy generation, but may exacerbate other issues. PV manufacturing depletes scarce resources, such as silver, tellurium and copper 1 , 2 . For instance, silver production could peak by 2030, with a risk of demand outstripping supply around 2075 3 . Although minerals and metals are essential for the transition to a low-carbon society, increased use could aggravate social and ecological problems 4 . Large-scale PV deployment also will produce substantial amounts of end-of-life (EOL) PV materials. By 2050, a cumulative 80 Mt of PV modules are expected to reach EOL globally, with 10 Mt in the United States alone 5 . Outcomes associated with increased PV deployment depend on the economic approach applied. In today’s predominantly linear economy, resources are extracted to manufacture goods, which are later discarded. The alternative circular economy (CE) model could mitigate resource and ecological challenges 6 by encouraging dematerialization and the recovery and reuse of products and materials 6 , 7 . Challenges to a PV CE include low recycling rates 3 , 8 , non-specialized PV recycling 9 , which results in low material recovery rates and profits 8 , difficult separation of module components 3 and product reuse limited by consumer awareness and attitude towards used products as well as to the current policy 10 . Adopting a social viewpoint to complement other perspectives could increase the effectiveness of circularity-promoting interventions. Social behaviours could play a critical role in developing secondary PV markets and managing EOL PV, because psychological and behavioural traits often undermine the viability of technical solutions 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 . Sovacool and Griffiths, for instance, report that culturally rooted driving behaviours influence the adoption of fuel-efficient vehicles and ride-sharing services 14 . However, current studies of material circularity (that is, the degree to which materials are recirculated in the economy) are limited to the technical and economic material efficiency potentials and do not account for consumer behaviour 13 , 15 . This assessment means that major changes in the way CE is analysed need to be undertaken 12 , 16 , 17 . We help fill this gap by incorporating social considerations into an exploration of the techno-economic, market and policy conditions that may improve the material circularity of the dominant crystalline-silicon (c-Si) PV module technology. We applied an agent-based model (ABM) to represent multiple actors involved with the PV life cycle as well as social factors (attitude and peer influence) that constrain CE strategies, and built a machine-learning (ML) metamodel (that is, a model of a model) to conduct a global sensitivity analysis. An ABM is well-suited to a study of the CE transition because it considers temporal aspects, adopts a systemic view, accounts for human decisions and interactions between actors 16 , and exploits recent advances in behavioural economics and psychology 16 , 18 , 19 , 20 . ABMs are used to study CE scenarios in relation to waste management 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 , but no previous model has included secondary market dynamics that underlie the reuse CE strategy. Many ABM studies have addressed PV adoption 19 , but the method has not been used to investigate renewable technologies through EOL. By integrating social considerations, we not only analyse the factors that affect PV CE scenarios more comprehensively than previous studies have, but we also explore types of CE interventions—such as strengthening warranties for used PV modules and ‘seeding’ used modules to encourage secondary-market development—that cannot be assessed using techno-economic analysis alone. The result is a fuller picture of the options available to promote PV circularity and a fuller picture of the potential effectiveness of those options separately and in combination. However, given the exploratory nature of our work, the results should be viewed as estimates of how CE principles could affect EOL management of PV modules in the future, rather than robust predictions. ABM of PV circularity In our ABM, four types of agents (PV owners, installers, recyclers and manufacturers) and five EOL management options (repair, reuse, recycling, landfilling and storage) are defined (Supplementary Fig. 1 ), with a focus on CE strategies that have been proposed by stakeholders as likely to contribute most to the CE in the future 25 . Landfilling and storage are included because those options are reported in the United States 26 , 27 . Two purchasing options are also modelled: the purchase of new or of used PV modules. For each type of agent, behavioural rules are defined to model the adoption of CE strategies. For instance, for PV owners, the ABM projects the cumulative amount of PV modules in use as well as the waste generated at their EOL. Then, the PV owner agents make decisions about whether to comply with a particular CE strategy according to the theory of planned behaviour (TPB), which is one of the most influential theories used to explain human behaviour 13 and accounts for various factors that affect human decisions, such as economics and peer influence. Details are presented in Methods and Supplementary Table 1 . Our ABM simulates the current US conditions, although changing several rules and other parameters would enable it to simulate EOL decisions for PV modules anywhere in the world. The European Union, where PV modules must be recycled at the EOL based on waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) regulations, is the most constrained region because only a few pathways are allowed. The United States is projected to have the second-largest amount of EOL modules by 2050 5 , and landfilling is considerably cheaper than recycling 26 . In this challenging environment for a PV CE, it is vital to identify the most effective and cost-efficient strategies or combinations of strategies to improve material circularity. To do so, we assessed not only the fraction of EOL mass that avoids being landfilled (and stored), but also societal costs (that is, the net costs of manufacturers, recyclers and installers) and recyclers and installers net revenue, because these metrics are relevant to assuring the sustainability of the CE. The dynamic factors considered include the PV module failure rate and the learning effect for module recycling—that is, the decrease in recycling costs with increasing recycled volumes due to factors such as economies of scale and technological advancement 28 . Our ABM is also stochastic to account for variability in some parameters, such as landfill costs, and to enable advanced sensitivity and uncertainty analysis (Supplementary Table 1 ). We ran 30 simulations for each scenario from 2020 to 2050 and present the means in this article; we selected the number of simulations based on a stability analysis reported in Supplementary Fig. 2 . The ABM differs from similar waste-management models as it includes decisions related to the demand and supply sides of reuse, accounts for technical factors, such as the recycling learning effect, and extends the reported metrics 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 . Our approach also differs from current literature on PV EOL management in that behavioural aspects are captured to better characterize the CE transition. We start by providing an overview of CE scenarios, and show that many interventions besides regulations could promote circularity (Fig. 1 , Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4 ). In the subsequent sections, we further explore several of the interventions from Fig. 1 . Fig. 1: Various interventions could improve material circularity in the PV sector. a – i , Landfill ban ( a ), high material recovery (96%) and US $18 per module recycling costs ( b ), lower recycling costs (US $18 per module) ( c ), higher landfill costs (US $2.75 per module) ( d ), improved learning (from 30 to 60 yr in 2050) ( e ), improved learning effect (learning parameter = 0.6) ( f ), reuse warranties (equal new/used attitude) ( g ), seeding reuse (5% of population per year) ( h ) and baseline ( i ). Some interventions, which include improved warranties ( g ) and seeding used modules ( h ), particularly boost module repair and reuse. Other interventions, such as lower initial recycling costs ( c ) and higher landfill costs ( d ), boost recycling. Full size image The baseline scenario reflects the current US conditions, calibrated to the available evidence (through iterations of full factorial experiments, the unknown PV owners’ attitudes towards CE behaviours were set to values that reproduced today’s low recycling and reuse rates 8 , 29 ). The baseline scenario also reproduces projected cumulative PV capacity and EOL modules based on the literature 5 . In this scenario, 500 GW of PV will be installed in the United States between 2020 and 2050, which generate 9.1 Mt of PV waste during the same period (Supplementary Fig. 5 ). The average initial recycling costs are US $28 per module, the average repair costs are US $65 per module, the used module prices are 36% of the new module prices on average and the average landfill costs are US $1.38 per module (Supplementary Table 1 ). In this scenario, most modules are landfilled (83%), with 1.2% reused and 9.5% recycled (here, the percentages are mass fractions of the total generated waste). Only 80% of a given module’s materials is recovered through recycling in the baseline scenario, because the assumed recycling process entails simple mechanical separation, which recovers only the aluminium frame and glass sheets from EOL modules 9 . Thus, the material recycling rate is 7.7%, equivalent to 0.7 Mt cumulatively through to 2050 (Fig. 1i ). In the following, we express all the EOL rates as the mass percentage of materials and represent cumulative amounts in 2050 unless otherwise specified. In this baseline scenario, recycling is not profitable in any year, even when the learning effect and the revenue from recovered materials is accounted for, so PV owners must pay a recycling fee (Supplementary Fig. 5 ). Techno-economic interventions could improve PV materials circularity. Research and development in recycling technologies could yield lower costs (Fig. 1c ), better performance or both (Fig. 1b,f ). Research and development to improve module durability would lower the amount of PV EOL materials generated (Fig. 1e ). Market interventions, such as better warranties for recovered modules (Fig. 1g ), higher landfill costs (Fig. 1d ), ‘seeding’ of used modules to encourage secondary market development (Fig. 1h ) and existing regulatory policies, such as a landfill ban 11 (Fig. 1a ) could also increase circularity. We also examined two existing business models of PV module manufacturers: extended producer responsibility and waste-generator responsibility (Supplementary Fig. 6 ). In Fig. 1 , the reuse of EOL PV modules is limited by customer willingness to purchase used modules, which explains the circularity rate decline around 2035 in some scenarios, as EOL PV modules move from the reuse pathway to other EOL pathways. Although the simulations start in 2020, the generation of EOL PV modules is assumed to start from modules installed in 2000. Effect of lower recycling costs on the recycling rate One barrier to recycling EOL PV modules is the lack of profitability 11 , 26 , 30 . Module materials are difficult to separate and, for the most part, have low values 30 . For example, silver accounts for half of the material value but represents less than 1% of the module mass 5 . Thus, recycling costs are not offset by revenues from recovered materials in the current simple mechanical processes of glass and metal recyclers in the United States, which leads to recycling fees of US $25–30 per module that PV owners or installers must bear in the absence of enhanced product responsibility or take-back programmes 26 . Some states, such as Maryland and Washington, have proposed tax incentives to overcome this issue 31 , 32 . Figure 2a (blue line with circles) shows the effect of varying the initial (year 1) recycling costs in the ABM. The percentage of recycled EOL modules increases steeply with the falling initial recycling costs before it plateaus and reaches 73% recovery at zero cost. The plateau is due to several factors: part of the materials from recycled modules is still landfilled (for example, silicon), for some PV owners storage costs are null, so storage competes with free recycling and some cliques of agents reinforce each other into non-recycling behaviours through peer influence (these agents are tightly connected in the social network and therefore strongly influence each other’s decisions). Owing to the learning effect (Fig. 2b ), recycling is profitable by 2050 for each value of the initial recycling costs below US $21 per module (Fig. 2a , red line with circle markers). With the current PV installed capacity and volumes of EOL modules, module recycling can still be considered in its infancy, and the learning effect will probably drive recycling costs down during 2020–2050. For instance, at an initial recycling cost of US $18 per module (similar to the processing costs of high-recovery mechanical processes reported in the literature 30 ) instead of US $28 per module in the baseline scenario, the recycling rate increases from 7.7 to 44% (or 4.0 Mt) in 2050 (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 3 ). With the learning effect, this initial recycling cost enables recycling to be profitable by 2050 with a net income of US $0.09 kg –1 . The material recycling rate is also higher when recycling processes recover more materials, for example, with the full-recovery end-of-life photovoltaic (FRELP) process. In this process, 94% of the silver and 97% of the silicon in c-Si PV modules are recovered 26 , which greatly enhances the value of the recovered materials (Fig. 3a , blue lines, and Supplementary Fig. 4 ). Fig. 2: The influence of recycling costs on the material recycling rate. a , In the baseline scenario, the volume of materials recycled (cumulative total in 2050) quickly increases with falling initial recycling costs until it reaches a plateau. Not accounting for economic factors (costs of recycling for PV owners) and social factors (attitude and peer influence) misrepresents the effect of lower initial recycling costs on the volume of materials recycled. Recycling is profitable (provides negative net costs, that is, recycling costs minus value of recovered materials) by 2050 for initial recycling costs of US $21 per module or less (black dashed line). Shaded areas represent 95% confidence intervals, blue and red lines correspond to the left and right y axes, respectively. b , Recycling costs (without accounting for the value of recovered materials) decrease with the amount of PV modules being recycled. Shaded areas represent 95% confidence intervals, blue and red lines correspond to the left and right y axes, respectively (see Supplementary Fig. 7 for a y axis in US $ kg –1 ). c , High initial subsidies (initial recycling costs of US $10 per module, yellow) boost recycling and help recyclers be profitable (due to the learning effect) more quickly than low subsidies do (initial recycling costs of US $18 per module, green), which results in lower overall costs for the subsidy provider (US $16 million per year instead of US $56 million per year to reach a 40% recycling rate). Full size image Fig. 3: The effect of the material recovery rate and initial recycling costs on material circularity and recyclers’ net income. a , Cumulative materials from EOL PV modules and recycler net income assuming the use of the FRELP process and an initial recycling cost of US $18 per module; in this scenario, the recycler cumulative net income reaches US $1.6 billion and the net income is US $0.42 kg –1 in 2050. b , Cumulative recovered material value in 2050 as a function of the material recovery rate and initial recycling costs; high materials recovery and low initial recycling costs have a synergistic effect on value generation. Full size image When costs alone are included in the model, the recycling rate is always null as long as recycling is more expensive than landfilling (that is, when the initial recycling costs are above US $3 per module)—see the ‘No social factors’ line in Fig. 2a . However, when social factors that influence the PV owner decisions, such as peer influence and attitude towards recycling, are included, the recycling rate increases with falling recycling costs. When social factors alone are included (the ‘No costs factors’ line in Fig. 2a ), the recycling rate is overestimated or underestimated. These results demonstrate the relevance of accounting for social aspects in the techno-economic analysis, because they may explain how and why a technology or behaviour is adopted. In our case study, the positive effect of social factors on circularity when the initial recycling costs are high shows the potential importance of nurturing early adopters of recycling behaviours who create a trend for other PV owners to follow. One strategy to increase recycling is to provide a subsidy until the recycling rate target is achieved. Our simulations indicate that a larger initial subsidy can be less costly than a smaller subsidy, because it engages more PV owners to recycle earlier (Fig. 2c ). Moreover, the learning effect supports recycling behaviours by lowering costs further, which leads to more PV owners adopting the recycling pathway. Overall, if the stream of EOL modules that reaches recyclers keeps increasing (which is likely), the learning effect could spur profitable recycling without subsidies. In our simulations, a 20% recycling target can be reached earlier with an US $18 per module subsidy (12 years) than with a US $10 per module subsidy (18 years), which limits the period over which subsidies must be provided. The simulations show that a yearly recycled volume above 15,000 t of EOL modules could make recycling profitable owing to the learning effect, a threshold value in line with the literature 33 . High subsidies to encourage recycling and exploit the learning effect are a relevant strategy, but the results depend strongly on the presence of a sufficient learning effect. Thus, a subsidy programme could benefit from establishing performance targets that verify the continuous improvement of recycling processes, which ensures that recycling costs do not return to original levels once subsidies stop. Economic benefits of a higher material recovery Recycling profitability could be increased through research and development in technologies that enable the recovery of more valuable materials—such as silver, copper and silicon—from EOL modules. High-recovery mechanical processes can enable a higher material recovery, up to 97% of the total mass using the FRELP process 26 ; however, in contrast with thermal recycling processes, such mechanical processes typically recover lower-quality materials with less value and usefulness than they had in the original module 3 . Figure 3a shows shares of modules in each EOL pathway and recycler net income assuming materials recovery fractions from the FRELP process 26 and an initial recycling cost of US $18 per module 30 . FRELP recovers 20% more materials per module than that in the baseline scenario and substantially increases the recovered material value owing to the silver and silicon recovery (Supplementary Table 1 ). This economic benefit is likely to weaken in the future, however, as innovation causes silver and silicon to constitute progressively smaller mass fractions in c-Si PV modules 5 ; our analysis does not consider this trend because of the high associated uncertainty. Recycler cumulative net income in 2050 increases from US $296 million in the simple mechanical process scenario to US $1.6 billion in the FRELP scenario. Moreover, recycling becomes profitable earlier (2032 instead of 2037), with recycler net income reaching US $0.42 kg –1 in 2050 (the dip in recycler net income in Fig. 3a (blue lines) is due to initially unprofitable recycling). Figure 3b shows the synergistic effect on the recovered material value of lower initial recycling costs (which spur recycling among PV owners) and higher total material recovery fractions. For instance, at an initial recycling cost of US $16 per module, a 13% increase from an 80% material recovery fraction roughly doubles the recovered material value. The synergy between the two factors diminishes as the initial recycling costs are very high or very low. Our simulations also show that some EOL modules are stored for a short period, which leads to the small, relatively constant share of stored modules in Fig. 3a (purple wedge) as PV owners and installers wait for cheaper and more accessible recycling options or the accumulation of quantities that are more economical to ship and recycle 26 . Strategies to improve PV module reuse Improved warranties for used modules could promote secondary markets 11 . The reuse rate increases from 1.2 to 23% (by 2.1 Mt) when it is assumed that warranties give PV owners an equivalent attitude towards used and new modules 10 (Figs. 1g and 4a ). However, this assumption also decreases the recycling rate from 7.7% to less than 1%. Figure 4b shows that a 23% reuse rate (that is, the result from Fig. 4a ) only covers a small portion of projected PV demand. Even with an ambitious 89% reuse rate—set by removing all the constraints to reuse except that modules can only be reused once in the ABM—only one-third of PV demand is met with used modules, which highlights the reuse strategy’s limitation. This result is explained by the projected growth of PV demand and the imperfect substitution of used modules for new modules (due to a lower power efficiency and lifetime 34 ) (see Supplementary Table 1 ). Once reused, modules still must be managed at the end of their second life, so developing other circular pathways, such as recycling or lifetime extension, is critical. Fig. 4: Reuse rate under different scenarios and the resulting displacement of new modules. a , Cumulative materials from EOL PV modules and installer net income assuming that improved warranties give PV owners an equivalent attitude towards used and new modules shows substantial module reuse. Installer cumulative net income is US $3.5 billion and net income is US $2.2 kg –1 in 2050. After 2025, the net income per module decreases as innovation reduces the PV module costs. b , Cumulative installed capacities of used (brown) and new (blue) modules in 2050 for various reuse rates obtained with our simulations; red diamonds (correspond to the right y axis) represent the average fraction of used modules. In an ideal reuse case (the 89% reuse bars), modules landfilled after their second life represent almost 10% of the cumulative EOL PV modules in 2050. Error bars are 95% confidence intervals. Full size image In practice, improved warranties may be insufficient to improve PV owner attitudes towards used modules, because other factors, such as safety concerns or aesthetic preferences, may intervene. Thus, other strategies to promote secondary markets should be considered. For instance, short-term ‘seeding’—providing free modules and installation to some PV owners—has proved to be an effective strategy 35 that could develop secondary markets for PV through the peer effect (Fig. 1h ). Such a seeding strategy applied to 5.0% of PV owners (that is, at least 5.0% of PV owners have used modules each year) enhances the reuse rate from 1.2 to 6.9% but lowers the recycling rate from 7.7 to 4.8% (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 3 ). A similar strategy, in which 10% of PV owners pay a lower initial recycling fee (US $18 per module), increases the material recycling rate to 21% (Supplementary Fig. 8 ). Sensitivity analysis and combined interventions We used a ML metamodel of the ABM to conduct a variance-based sensitivity analysis and explore the ABM parameter space at a higher speed. In this approach, the ABM is used to generate both the training and cross-validation data of the ML metamodel, whereas the latter provides expected outputs of the ABM for a given parameter combination. Figure 5 presents the first- and total-order Sobol indices (which measure the main effects and interaction effects, respectively) for some parameters that underlie the techno-economic and social interventions presented thus far. Initial recycling costs, landfill costs and the learning effect are most important to the module circularity rate, with contributions of 48, 33 and 4% to the total variance in results, respectively (Supplementary Table 3 ). The attitude towards used modules has a smaller but notable effect. Although some parameters present higher-order effects, the parameters rank similarly. However, the rankings change when examining output metrics other than the material circularity rate, such as the reuse rate or societal costs (Supplementary Table 3 and Supplementary Figs. 9 – 11 ). Finally, notable second-order interactions exist between the initial recycling costs and other parameters (Supplementary Table 4 ). Fig. 5: Parameter importance for EOL PV module circularity in the ABM. Categorical parameters, such as the landfill ban, are excluded. The y axis shows the first- and total-order Sobol indices on the effect of a parameter on the EOL PV module circularity. Error bars are 95% confidence intervals. Full size image Figure 6 presents the interaction effects between the initial recycling costs and four other parameters: landfill cost, attitude towards used modules, learning parameter and number of recycling facilities. Increments of the landfill cost and learning parameter boost the effect of decreasing the initial recycling costs on the material circularity (Figs. 6a,c , respectively). For instance, with initial recycling costs of US $10 per module, raising the landfill cost from US $1.38 to 2.76 per module increases the material circularity rate from about 60 to 70% (Fig. 6a ). As the reuse and recycling pathways compete, combining a more positive attitude towards used modules with lower recycling costs does not enhance the volume of PV materials diverted from landfills and storage (Fig. 6b ). Transportation costs are negligible compared with recycling costs, so having fewer facilities increases the material circularity rate slightly owing to an enhanced learning effect (Fig. 6d ). Finally, as with the sensitivity indices (Fig. 5 ), the results are different when examining other output metrics (Supplementary Figs. 12 and 13 ). Fig. 6: Fractions of PV module materials in circular pathways in 2050 as a function of the initial recycling costs. a – d , Landfill costs ( a ), attitude towards used modules ( b ), learning effect parameter ( c ) and number of recycling facilities ( d ). Full size image Figure 6 also highlights that different intervention combinations may yield the same results (that is, equifinality). For instance, initial recycling costs of US $18 per module combined with landfill costs of US $2 per module yield a 45% circularity rate, as do initial recycling costs of US $13 per module combined with 48 recycling facilities. Using the ML metamodel, we designed an experiment to identify the parameter combinations that maximize the circularity rate while minimizing societal costs (Supplementary Table 5 ). Overall, combining low recycling costs, high landfill costs and a high learning effect yields the best result in the ABM, which suggests that combining interventions might be the most promising strategy to increase PV circularity at the lowest costs. Discussion Our results should be understood as estimates of how applying CE principles could affect the EOL management of PV modules, and not as robust predictions. The ABM uses various sources as inputs, which include some outside the PV sector (for example, electronic waste literature) owing to the limited availability of primary data. For instance, the initial recycling and reuse rates are dated to 2016, and more recent estimates could yield slightly different results. Moreover, as some data variability is unknown, we approximate it using probability distributions, which adds uncertainty to the results (Supplementary Table 1 ). In practice, there are regional geopolitical and demographic differences, which could lead to various degrees of adoption of CE practices. Although we use the TPB to better represent human decisions related to EOL management, factors not included in the theory may affect stakeholder decisions. The parameters of the TPB model were also taken from a meta-analysis on recycling behaviours, which may not directly apply to the PV context (Supplementary Table 6 ). In addition, we simplify stakeholders as constituting four broad categories (PV owners, installers, recyclers and manufacturers); in the real world, the decisions of intermediary actors (for example, brokers and insurers) may also affect PV circularity. We limited the number of PV owner agents to one thousand, whereas more than one million real-world PV systems are in the United States 36 . Moreover, PV owners are not geographically characterized, albeit related through a social network. Although we use distributions to represent some geographical disparity, we distribute total installed PV capacity evenly between agents. Combining this ABM with a distributed PV model with a better spatial resolution, such as the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s Distributed Generation Market Demand model, could yield useful insights (for example, regarding geopolitical and demographic regional differences) 37 . Our study yields several implications for PV circularity. First, our results suggest that CE strategies compete, in line with the literature 38 . Thus, CE programmes should be based on the adoption rates for all circular pathways rather than focus on one CE strategy. Second, for reuse to be effective, the used product supply must match demand, and therefore secondary markets must be mature 39 . For example, only when PV owner attitudes towards used modules improve (for example, through warranties) does demand grow and start to substantially absorb used module supplies. Improving reuse is critical from an energy perspective, because recycling destroys most of the embedded energy of products 40 , 41 . However, owing to the growing PV demand as well as the lower efficiency and lifetime of used modules, even a 100% reuse rate could not satisfy PV demand, so recycling must be developed in concert with reuse initiatives. Our results also highlight the critical roles of the total recovery fraction of materials and the learning effect to achieve profitable recycling (Fig. 1b,f , respectively), in line with existing literature 30 . Interestingly, the storage pathway acts as a buffer, which provides time for recycling processes to become more economical and ultimately diverts some modules from landfills (Fig. 3a , purple wedge). This result suggests that encouraging recycling may be particularly critical where storage space is more limited (for example, Japan). Exploiting the ABM approach, we extended the traditional techno-economic analysis to include social factors, such as conformity to peers and general attitude towards a specific behaviour. Accounting for attitude is especially relevant for PV, because households and businesses may be inclined to environmental protection and thus recycling 42 , 43 . Our ABM can also be used to study interconnections and dynamics among different factors, as suggested by Lapko et al. 38 . Our results confirm the importance of factors such as the learning effect, research and development to reduce recycling costs, and public engagement 38 . Interestingly, the importance of the factors changes with the focus on different output metrics. The attitude towards used PV modules, for instance, seems less important considering the overall material circularity rate because the number of reused modules is low compared with the number of overall modules. However, this factor is the most influential regarding the overall societal cost because reuse retains more value within the economy than material recovery through recycling. Thus, ignoring social factors (such as attitude) may misrepresent the efficacy of CE interventions. Although there are currently no manufacturers of silicon wafers in the United States 44 , recycling modules in a facility near the manufacturing line is a competitive advantage, because it makes manufacturing more resilient to supply restrictions and potentially facilitates the recycling of manufacturing waste, such as silicon kerf. Recycling manufacturing waste is critical to improve the circularity, because scrap materials are less contaminated and have compositions that are better known, compared with those of postconsumer materials 45 . Such a strategy is already used by First Solar, a cadmium–telluride PV module manufacturer (Supplementary Fig. 6 ). The results also show that a landfill ban, such as the one in Washington State 31 , could increase PV circularity substantially (Fig. 1a ). However, legislation alone may be insufficient. Current European legislation, for instance, encourages mass recycling, but not necessarily high-quality multimaterials recycling 26 . Finally, our results show that high subsidies for a few years could be among the most efficient solutions to encourage recycling. In contrast with Deng et al., who found that landfill costs have the most potent effect, followed by recycling costs, we found that the initial recycling costs have the most substantial effect, followed by landfill costs 30 . This difference may occur for different reasons, for instance, because of different data used in the analysis or because the proposed model includes social factors, which impact recycling and purchasing behaviours and, thus, the results. Moreover, when looking at output metrics other than the material circularity rate, the ranking of the most influential factors changes (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Figs. 12 and 13 ). In summary, this work highlights the importance of considering social factors in future CE studies. When such factors are ignored, the results may be overestimated or underestimated as they may not represent what happens in the real world. Moreover, the key to improve PV material circularity and retain maximum value in the economy may be in social interventions that aim to improve customer attitudes towards used PV modules (for example, with better certifications and warranties). Could it be possible to have a secondary market for used PV as strong as the market for used cars 34 ? In future work, the ABM could be used to study other scenarios, such as the effect of public information campaigns on recycling rates. Moreover, although a design-related intervention is briefly presented (Fig. 1e ), more scenarios related to the design stage, such as modules with different backsheet materials 46 , could be explored. This approach, combining ABM and ML, could also be developed further to study the circularity of other technologies, such as consumer electronics, or to include environmental considerations. Methods Overview Our ABM represents the main actors of the US PV sector that are involved in the transition to a more circular PV industry. Its objective is to find the techno-economic and social conditions that improve materials circularity for EOL PV modules. The ABM’s primary outputs are the mass volumes of modules that reach each EOL pathway (that is, amounts that are reused, repaired, recycled, landfilled or stored), the net revenue and cost for each CE actor, the value from recovered materials and the number of years it takes to reach a specific objective. The overview, design concepts and details protocol is used to describe the ABM in this section 47 , followed by details on the ML approach used to build a metamodel of the ABM and the sensitivity analysis method. The purpose of the ABM is to study the implementation of CE strategies within the PV industry and identify the conditions that improve circularity. Four types of agents are defined: PV owners, installers, recyclers and manufacturers. Agents of a specific type behave similarly, but have heterogeneous characteristics represented by probability distributions (for example, recyclers may have different recycling costs). Agents are related to each other according to a social network that represents the real-world relationships among the CE actors. In the simulation, a time step represents a year. The start of the simulation is 2020, with 30 time steps chosen because many installations will reach their EOL around 2050 5 . The ABM builds on several existing models (referred as submodels in Supplementary Table 1 ). At each time step, the submodels are used in coordination to generate the output metrics. The ABM starts by modelling the cumulative amount of PV modules in use (that is, the stocks), following an approach from the literature 5 . Then, the amount of EOL PV modules is computed from a model and data from the same source 5 . We apply another submodel to represent how agents make decisions regarding a particular CE strategy. The modelled CE strategies include repair, reuse (of a repaired and/or refurbished product) and recycle, and the two other options landfill and storage. Agent decisions are based on techno-economic factors—which include technical feasibility, such as whether the modules can be repaired, and costs, such as landfill costs—and market factors (such as attitudes and social norms). The parameters used in this submodel were taken from meta-analyses on recycling and purchasing behaviours, in which it was reported that consumers influence each other’s behaviours in addition to being influenced by behaviours’ costs 48 , 49 . To compute the material circularity and the societal costs (that is, net costs of manufacturers, recyclers and installers), the ABM uses a submodel of PV module efficiency growth 5 , the mass fraction of material in the modules 5 , the different recycling processes’ material recovery fractions 26 , 50 and prices of virgin and scrap materials. The recycler learning effect also uses a model and data from the literature 28 . Another submodel estimates the transportation costs related to the different EOL pathways (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 14 ). The resulting volumes of repaired, reused, recycled, landfilled and stored change with each time step of the simulation. Supplementary Fig. 1 presents an overview of the model, Supplementary Table 1 and the sections below provide more methodological details. Design concept The ABM is designed in a modular fashion to ensure it can be used for different case studies; different types of agents may be defined and easily added to the model. Each agent type is defined as a Python module. In these modules, agent types are defined as Python classes, and it follows that each agent is an instance of the class of its type. A Python model module contains all the user-defined inputs, activates the agents and collects the outputs of the simulation. This modular structure is per the Mesa Python package 51 . This package is used to facilitate the activation of the agents and set up batch runs of simulations. The NetworkX Python package is also used to build the social networks relating the agents 52 . Interactions between actors of the CE are captured at several levels in the ABM (that is, within agents of the same type and between agent types). First, because interactions between PV owners may influence their decisions regarding EOL management 22 , 48 , 53 , they are accounted for in the model. Second, information flows between agents of different types. For instance, PV owners have access to recyclers’ recycling costs, and installers access the amount of PV modules being sold by PV owners. As another example, manufacturers know the amounts of materials being recovered by recyclers and compute the economic benefits of using those materials rather than virgin materials. The model also contains several stochastic elements. First, the Watts–Strogatz algorithm, which is widely used to build small-world networks, requires us to rewire each edge of a regular graph with a certain probability 52 , 54 , 55 . Small-world networks are recognized as representing many real-world networks, which include social networks 54 , 55 , 56 , 57 . Second, some of the agents’ characteristics are drawn from probability distributions to model their variability or uncertainty (for example, recycling or landfill costs may be different across the United States). Finally, the system’s overall behaviour emerges from the agents’ interactions and decisions during the simulation. Details At the beginning of the simulation, the network of agents is created. The stocks of PV modules from 2000 to 2020 are reported in the ABM and divided among PV owner agents. We chose stocks from 2000 to 2020 to account for the existing installed capacity, assuming that, before 2000, the cumulative installed capacity was negligible. From there, several submodels are used to represent various dynamics of the hypothetical circular PV sector. The environment of the ABM is the United States. Various interventions may be enacted in the environment to see their effects. For instance, scenarios that study the implementation of a tax or a ban may be modelled as part of the environment agents that evolve within. Moreover, agents’ interactions are dependent on a social network that represents the real-world relationships between the PV industry actors (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 15 ). In contrast with aggregated models, the ABM enables the modelling of different social network structures and provides insights into the social network role in the overall behaviour of the system 54 . Different network structures are adapted to different real-world situations. For instance, a fully connected network is more adapted to describing small groups and tight communities. For sociotechnical systems, such as the power grid or cities, the small-world or scale-free networks are more realistic 54 , 56 . In the ABM, a small-world network is drawn using a rewiring probability and the average number of neighbours of 0.1 and 10, respectively. These parameters are close to those of other works and real-world networks such as email communications 54 , 58 . Owing to computational limitations, the number of PV owners was restricted to 1,000 agents. Although it limits the representativeness of the ABM, this number of agents enables the capture of network effects and the existing variability of PV owners (for example, regarding landfill costs across the United States or attitudes towards CE pathways). The PV owners make two decisions: to purchase a new or a used product, and to manage the EOL of their products (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 16 ). Several processes also occur in the PV owners’ module. First, the amount of product purchased each year is determined according to a piecewise function, following previous work 5 , and thus similar results for the projected installed capacity are obtained, although we only consider US c-Si PV modules. Values for the model’s parameters can be found in Supplementary Information , Supplementary Tables 1 , 7 and 8 . Still following the literature, the efficiency growth of PV modules is accounted for with an exponential function 5 . Next, a Weibull function (from which the parameters are based on empirical data 5 ) is used to generate the amount of PV modules of agent i that reaches EOL at time t , \({\rm{ELPV}}_i^t\) (equation ( 1 )): $$\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {{\rm{ELPV}}_i^t = \mathop {\sum }\limits_t {\rm{RPA}}_i^t \times \left( {1 - {\rm{e}}^{ - (t/T)^\alpha }} \right)} \end{array}$$ (1) In the equation, T is the average lifetime of the PV modules, α the shape factor (which controls the typical S shape of the Weibull curve) and \({\rm{RPA}}_i^t\) is the remaining amount of PV modules installed by agent i at time step t . The Weibull function is appropriate to model the PV waste generation 5 . The TPB 59 is used to model the PV owners’ decisions to purchase used or new modules and the EOL management of these modules. The TPB stipulates that human behaviours are influenced by the attitude A individuals hold towards the behaviour (that is, how the behaviour is perceived as favourable or unfavourable), the subjective norm SN, which refers to the perceived social pressure to perform or not perform the behaviour and the perceived behavioural control (PBC), which relates to the perceived ease or difficulty of performing the behaviour (equation ( 2 )): $$\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {{\rm{BI}} = w_AA + w_{{\rm{SN}}}{\rm{SN}} + w_{{\rm{PBC}}}{\rm{PBC}}} \end{array}} \end{array}$$ (2) In the equation, BI is the intention to perform the behaviour, and w A , w SN and w PBC are the weights of each factor in the overall decision. The TPB is often used in ABMs of sociotechnical systems because it explains the process of individual decision making straightforwardly 21 , 24 , 60 and has been applied in many waste-management ABMs 21 , 22 , 24 . The theory explains consumers’ decisions 49 , 61 as well as decisions within companies 13 , 62 , 63 , 64 . In our ABM, a score is attributed to each EOL pathway according to the TPB. The attitude level of each agent regarding the CE pathways (repairing, reusing and recycling) is normally distributed between 0 (negative attitude) and 1 (positive attitude). The attitude level towards linear pathways (landfilling and storing) is simply assumed to be one minus the attitude held for CE pathways. Although this distribution of agents is rather simple when compared with that in the literature 21 , it is deemed sufficient for this exploratory analysis. As the parameters of the truncated normal distribution were unknown, they were calibrated. Thus, an iterative process was undertaken to find the values that reproduce low recycling 3 , 8 and reuse 65 rates, as they represent today’s situation. The second element of the TPB, the subjective norm \(SN_{ip}^t\) of agent i and pathway p at t , is defined as per equation ( 3 ): $$\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {{\rm{SN}}_{ip}^t = \mathop {\sum }\limits_n \frac{{{\rm{Path}}_{np}^t}}{N}} \end{array}$$ (3) with \({\rm{Path}}_{np}^t\) being 1 if agent i ’s neighbour n has selected path p and zero otherwise, and N being the total number of neighbours of agent i . Thus, the subjective norm takes values between zero (no peer pressure) and one (maximum peer pressure). In the ABM, although neighbours designate nodes that share an edge in the small-world network, they may represent various relationships among PV owners in the real world (for example, friends, family, co-workers and actual neighbours). The third element of the TPB, the perceived behavioural control (that is, the perceived economic or cognitive ability to perform the behaviour), \({\rm{PBC}}_{ip}^t\) of agent i and pathway p at t is given by equation ( 4 ): $$\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {{\rm{PBC}}_{ip}^t = - {\rm{max}}\left( {0;\frac{{{\rm{Cost}}_{ip}^t}}{{|{\rm{max}}\left\{ {{\rm{Cost}}_{ip}^t\forall \,p} \right\}|}}} \right)} \end{array}$$ (4) where \({\rm{Cost}}_{ip}^t\) is the cost of choosing the pathway p at t for agent i . Finally, the behavioural intention \({\rm{BI}}_{ip}^t\) of agent i for pathway p at t is defined by equation ( 5 ): $$\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {{\rm{BI}}_{ip}^t = w_AA_{ip}^t + w_{{\rm{SN}}}{\rm{SN}}_{ip}^t + w_{{\rm{PBC}}}{\rm{PBC}}_{ip}^t} \end{array}} \end{array}$$ (5) In equation ( 5 ), the values for the attitude, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control factor coefficients ( w A , w SN and w PBC , respectively) are taken from an existing meta-analysis on factors that affect EOL management decisions 48 . Given the high uncertainty of the coefficients’ values (Supplementary Table 9 ), the agents could behave differently than described in this work. Supplementary Table 6 shows the results of a sensitivity analysis on the TPB’s coefficients. Alternatively, the coefficients’ values could be calibrated (however, the lack of empirical data on current and projected PV EOL management prevents us from conducting such extensive calibration). The agent then selects the EOL pathway with the highest score (and the amount of EOL modules \({\rm{ELPV}}_i^t\) is recorded as following the selected pathway for further use by other agents and the output metrics). The TPB is also used to model the purchase decision, similar to how the EOL decision is modelled. Two options are represented in this ABM, the purchase of a new or of a used module. Another meta-analysis is used to determine the TPB coefficient values for the purchase decision 49 . The TPB may be interpreted in terms of material efficiency potentials. If one defines w A and w SN to be 0, the techno-economic potentials of the recycling, repairing and reusing CE strategies may be studied on their own. Otherwise, the social factors of the model (the subjective norm and attitude) may be added, which enables study of the achievable (or market) potential of material efficiency 15 . Installers are the second type of agent (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 17 ). In the PV sector, installers may be in charge of collecting the EOL PV modules and eventually sorting them before selling them on the secondary market 66 (Supplementary Information , Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 18 ). They may also repair failed modules if PV owners opt for that EOL pathway. If there is insufficient demand for used modules or if they are too damaged or cost too much to be repaired (equations ( 6 ) and ( 7 )), installers send them to a recycler or landfill, or they store them (for a limited period defined in Supplementary Table 1 ) until another decision is made depending on the cheapest decision at the time of the simulation (using equation ( 4 )). Although installers’ repairing costs may decrease due to the learning effect, it is assumed that handling used PV modules bears the same repair costs (whether the modules are repaired directly for PV owners or sold as used products), regardless of the possible damage to the EOL modules: $$\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {V_j^t = \frac{{{\rm{RR}} \times (\mathop {\sum }\nolimits_i V_i^t + \mathop {\sum }\nolimits_k V_k^t)}}{{\mathop {\sum }\nolimits^ j}}\,{\rm{for}}\,i\,{\rm{and}}\,k\,{\rm{such}}\,{\rm{that}}\,{\rm{RC}}_i^t \le {\rm{RP}}_j^t\,{\rm{and}}\,{\rm{RC}}_k^t \le {\rm{RP}}_j^t} \end{array}$$ (6) $$\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} {{\rm{RA}}_j^t = \left\{ {\begin{array}{*{20}{l}} {V_j^t\,{\rm{if}}\,\mathop {\sum }\limits_j V_j^t \le \mathop {\sum }\limits_i {\rm{DU}}_i^t\,{\rm{for}}\,i\,{\rm{such}}\,{\rm{that}}\,{\rm{PU}}_i^t = 1} \hfill \\ {0\,{\rm{otherwise}}} \hfill \end{array}} \right.} \end{array}$$ (7) In the equations, \(V_j^t\) is the volume of modules available for sale on the secondary market by installer j . Next, RR is the module repair rate, \(V_i^t\) and \(V_k^t\) are the volume of modules that flow from the PV owner i and recycler k at time t , respectively, \({\rm{RC}}_i^t\) and \({\rm{RC}}_k^t\) are the repair costs of modules from PV owner i and recycler k at time t , respectively, and \({\rm{RP}}_j^t\) is the price at which agent j is selling the used modules on the secondary market at time t . Finally, \({\rm{RA}}_j^t\) is the amount of used modules handled by installer j that is sold on the secondary market at time t ; it depends on the demand for used modules from PV owners ( \(\mathop {\sum }\limits_i {\rm{DU}}_i^t\) ). In equation ( 7 ), \({\rm{PU}}_i^t\) is a Boolean that is one when the PV owner i has decided to purchase a used module at time t and zero otherwise. Installers also improve their repair processes owing to the learning effect, and thus decrease repair costs. The learning effect can be characterized by several mechanisms, such as technology advancement, increased labour productivity, economies of scale and improved material and energy efficiency 28 . As the volume of EOL PV modules dealt with by an installer increases, at least three of these mechanisms may apply: increased labour productivity, economies of scale and energy efficiency. In the ABM, the learning effect is modelled as a function of the repaired volume, following the literature 28 . Recycler agents are similar to installers in two ways. First, they may take on the responsibility of sorting EOL PV modules that can be sold on secondary markets (with those modules then flowing to installers); this behaviour was assessed via interviews with a US recycler (RecyclePV, personal communication). Second, recyclers improve their recycling processes in the model, which simulates the learning effect (Supplementary Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. 19 ). Another recycler role is to recover materials from EOL PV modules. In the ABM, this is simply modelled from the material recovery rates of a given recycling process (for example, simple mechanical processes or the FRELP process 26 ), the fractions of materials that constitute PV modules and the volume of modules being recycled. In the ABM, PV owners pay a fee to recycle EOL PV modules, whereas manufacturers buy recycled materials at market prices. With the current US recycling processes, revenue from the recovered materials is insufficient to cover recycling costs 26 . Manufacturer agents purchase recovered materials from recyclers (Supplementary Table 1 and Fig. 20 ). The avoided costs from using recovered rather than virgin materials can be computed within the model based on their respective values. For instance, the price of aluminium scrap is often about 60% of the price of virgin aluminium 67 , which brings profits for manufacturers that use aluminium. The model does not consider price fluctuation, given the price volatility of materials such as silicon and silver. We applied four validation techniques to ensure the quality of the results produced by the model: theory validation, data validation, model output validation and face validation 68 . First, regarding theory validation, only empirically validated models were used (for example, TPB). Next, for the baseline scenario, empirical data were mostly used; when parameters were unknown, they were calibrated 3 , 5 , 8 , 65 . Given that several parameter combinations could lead to the same results (that is, equifinality), we further analysed the impact of different values for the two calibrated parameters (that is, the attitude values for the purchase of second-hand PV modules and EOL management) on the results (Supplementary Fig. 21 ). Then, the cumulative installed capacity and the mass of EOL PV modules generated during the 2020 to 2050 period were validated with the literature 5 (Supplementary Fig. 5 ). Finally, the results of the ABM went through an internal revision process with ABM and PV experts to ensure the model was behaving in a meaningful way, and extreme scenarios were also studied (Supplementary Table 10 ). Multilayer perceptron regressor metamodel and sensitivity analysis The combination of ABM and ML has recently gained attention owing to the complementarity of the two approaches 69 . These methods can be combined in two ways: ML can generate agent behavioural rules from data 35 , and an ABM can be explored in depth (that is, varying the ABM inputs to examine a wide range of possible outputs) by building a ML metamodel that avoids computationally intensive simulations and saves time 70 . The exploratory nature of this work meant we used the second approach in this study. Following Vahdati et al., we built a ML metamodel of the ABM described above 70 . Using the Scikit-learn Python library 71 , we constructed different ML models using different combinations of hyperparameters. In our study, all the features (input data) and output data are known in the dataset generated by the ABM; thus, a supervised ML is used. In this study, the training dataset is generated with the ABM. To produce the dataset that best represents the behaviour space of our model while limiting the required number of simulations, we used a quasi-Monte Carlo approach. First, we defined the range of each parameter to vary in the quasi-Monte Carlo simulations. For some parameters, it is merely their minimum and maximum possible values (for example, for ratios). For parameters without theoretical bounds, realistic ranges were defined according to the literature. For landfill costs, for instance, the minimum value was set to zero and the maximum value was set to twice the average value of the baseline scenario; it seems unrealistic that landfill costs could be higher than that based on current trends 27 . A similar logic was applied to other parameters (Supplementary Table 5 ). Next, the method from Saltelli was used to generate the Sobol sequences of parameter value combinations 72 . Sobol sequences aim to approximate the model’s behaviour within the parameter space by attempting to cover as much of the parameter space as possible as quickly (with the fewest samples) as possible. This is one of the highest-performing methods (for example, compared with the Latin hypercube design) regarding the quality of results obtained as a function of computational time, and it is often used to build metamodels 73 , 74 . Thus, using the SALib Python library 75 , 2,800 parameter value combinations were generated, to which we added the baseline parameter value combination as well as variants of the baseline, varying each parameter to its lower and upper bound (to include extreme cases in our dataset). In total, 2,810 parameter value combinations were run 6 times (this number of replicates was found sufficient to account for the model’s stochasticity, based on a stability analysis reported in Supplementary Fig. 22 ), which amounted to 16,860 simulations. Next, we iterated a tenfold cross-validation, varying the ML algorithm, its hyperparameters and the output metric considered in the dataset. We kept the multilayer perceptron regressor algorithm, which yields a good compromise between computation time and a high coefficient of determination in all the output metrics (Supplementary Table 11 ). Once trained, the metamodel was used to predict the outputs of parameter value combinations not run with the ABM. The SALib library was finally used to conduct a variance-based (Sobol) sensitivity analysis and thus measure the variability of model outputs that can be accounted for by changes in the model inputs. We used the Sobol method because of its ability to evaluate interaction effects and the low risk that dependencies exist between the parameters of our ABM. Moreover, we compared the results from the variance-based sensitivity analysis with results from a moment-independent sensitivity analysis to confirm the rankings of the parameters (Supplementary Table 3 ). The use of the ML metamodel means results from Figs. 3b , 5 and 6 , Supplementary Tables 3 – 5 and Supplementary Figs. 9 – 13 are approximations of the ABM’s results.

More content below DSP CRTO TTD MACQ MACQU OB By Jarrett Banks Advertising-technology company AdTheorent Inc. plans to merge with SPAC MCAP Acquisition Corp. (Nasdaq: MACQ). The company uses machine learning and data science to optimize advertising and marketing campaigns for its customers. IPO Edge sat down with CEO James Lawson to find out more about going public and the future of adtech. IPO Edge: We’ve seen a number of adtech companies enter public markets in recent months. How are you different from others in the space? Within the programmatic ecosystem, AdTheorent is a Demand Side Platform, or DSP – but we’ve reimagined what that means. We are fundamentally different because we have pioneered a new method to target digital ads in a programmatic marketplace without relying on the primary methods of the past: cookies and licensed audience segments. Our new method – Predictive Advertising – drives industry-leading campaign performance without relying on user-specific profiles and individualized data. In place of legacy targeting methods, AdTheorent’s Predictive Advertising platform leverages award-winning data science and machine learning (ML) capabilities to deliver advertiser-specific business outcomes for our advertisers. Our brand and agency customers today not only want, but require, measurable business outcomes from their ad spend. That’s AdTheorent’s specialty. If a brand’s KPI is an online insurance quote application, for example, our platform and ML models will identify data attributes present most often when there is a conversion event. Then, our bidders automatically optimize toward those attributes to drive KPI performance, and our models learn and refine optimizations over time as more conversions occur. These attributes may include things like device type, operating system, one or more keywords in the URL, keywords in the page content, geographic data, time, or approximately 200 other data attributes that are available to inform our machine learning models. Using historical conversion data, we can determine the likelihood that each specific bid request will drive the online or real-world actions our clients desire. We model towards and deliver advanced conversions, not just clicks, and our ability to do so continually improves as our machine learning platform makes automated optimizations which make our ad targeting even more efficient. And this ability really sets us apart from our peer group. Story continues On top of this revolutionary platform and approach, AdTheorent’s proprietary suite of tools, methodologies and vertical solutions maximize performance and ROI for advertisers while operating in a privacy-first manner, which has become an essential element for brand marketers. AdTheorent’s platform is more effective and privacy-forward than other AdTech companies. This combination of consistent performance and more reliable business outcomes is what keeps our customers coming back and entrusting us with more of their business over time. IPO Edge: Why are you going public now, and how will it benefit the business? There has never been more demand for our capabilities and unique offerings, and now is a good time for us to accelerate the scale of our operation. We spent the past few years investing heavily in AdTheorent’s technology, accelerating organic growth and increasing efficiency. From a financial perspective, we are operating in excess of the ‘Rule of 50,’ with Revenue Less TAC growth and adjusted EBITDA margin each expected to be around 30% annually between 2020 and 2023. The market continues to move toward AdTheorent, which is validating for our business model and makes us excited about the opportunities ahead. Collectively with our investors, we believe AdTheorent’s unique positioning can drive outsized growth in the $90 billion market for US programmatic digital media spend, projected to grow 17.6% per annum through 2024. The public company structure and proceeds provided by the transaction will allow AdTheorent to optimize growth by increasing investment behind multiple growth vectors, both organic and inorganic. IPO Edge: You are going public through a SPAC merger with MCAP but your record of financial performance seems to set you apart from most SPACs, can you tell us about your thought process there? It is true, we are not a typical SPAC target given our historical strong financial performance. We expect great things from ourselves in the future, of course, but we come to the table with a track record of past financial performance that should be exciting and assuring for MCAP shareholders, and we think this makes us very unique among SPAC targets. We had lot of strategic options for this next chapter but ultimately decided to continue our solid partnership with Monroe given our history with them (as our lender) and their track record of success with other SPACs. We believe we will perform very well as a public company given our disciplined approach to running a profitable and growing business. IPO Edge: AdTheorent recently announced Q2 2021 business results, which showed continued growth in revenue. Can you give us insight into these results and the business drivers for them? We are very pleased with our Q2 2021 financial performance, which outpaced our expectations, growing revenue by 89% to $39.9 million compared to $21.1 million in the second quarter of 2020. This growth demonstrates the power of AdTheorent’s technology and solutions and our ability to deliver strong ROI for our advertiser clients. Brand marketers understand the value we provide to them and we have never been more confident about our ability to drive long-term durable growth. As a result, we raised our outlook for full-year 2021 and now expect revenue of at least $161.6 million, compared to our prior outlook for 2021 revenue of $157.7 million and expect full-year 2021 Revenue Less TAC* of at least $106.2 million, compared to our prior outlook for 2021 Revenue Less TAC of $102.4 million.Revenue Less TAC is a non-GAAP measure that adjusts for costs incurred to execute customer campaigns: advertising inventory, third party inventory validation and measurement, and data – which is collectively referred to as “traffic acquisition costs” or “TAC”. IPO Edge: Based on your experience thus far throughout 2021 and the nature of the digital market, what are the best opportunities to expand your business for the rest of this year, and into 2022? According to the Winterberry Group, digital media spending will exceed $171 billion in the US in 2021 and is poised for exceptional growth, driven in large part by programmatic advertising. As I mentioned earlier, programmatic digital spending in the US is a $90 billion Total Addressable Market in 2021, forecasted to grow at a 17.6% CAGR to $141 billion by 2024. Since 2012, AdTheorent has pioneered a new way to target digital ads programmatically without relying on user-specific personal profiles and individualized data. We have a history of operating efficiently, with consistent margin expansion the last four years, tracking toward 30% revenue growth and 30% adjusted EBITDA margins in 2021. We see a number of meaningful organic opportunities, including increased revenue in Connected TV, or CTV, continued vertical growth and expansion, and we will look into international expansion given our privacy-forward approach to ad-targeting. We will also look to opportunistically invest in M&A to accelerate these opportunities. CTV, in particular, is a major growth opportunity for AdTheorent. Streaming services like Hulu are the fastest growing sector as traditional TV dollars shift to digital. AdTheorent applies machine learning to CTV to drive performance-based outcomes based on our advanced, proprietary analytics capabilities. With limited investment, our 2021 CTV revenues are anticipated to be $40 million, representing approximately 300% growth year-over-year, and with additional investment, we believe we can continue to materially outpace expected annual industry growth of 18%. With respect to vertical growth, we believe it is important to continue to invest in solutions which solve our customers’ unique campaign challenges. That means coming up with new and better ways to attain their campaign KPIs, sensitive to data limitations and rules in various regulated industries. We have a list of innovations and new offerings that we are excited to explore across a number of different verticals, and this investment capital will help us accelerate our plans. IPO Edge: At the moment, cookies are the biggest trend in the digital advertising industry. Google has declared its intention to doing away with cookies, and Apple is restricting the use of device IDs for advertising. How do you believe this will impact the industry, and what will happen to the existing digital ad market, which is almost entirely compromised of cookie-based and ID-based ads? And how does AdTheorent benefit? Google recently announced that by 2023 third-party cookies will not be used within its Chrome browser, following Apple’s work to phase out the use of third-party cookies from the Safari browser. Google has delayed this transition for a number of reasons, including the chaos that would likely ensue if the cord were pulled too quickly. Without the proper groundwork in place, publishers could be forced to enact paywalls on their content across the internet, which would alienate consumers. While the industry scrambles to figure out a replacement for third-party cookies and competitors in the adtech space are distracted by the coming transition, we will continue to improve our algorithms and Predictive Targeting methods using machine learning. We will continue to win with customers because we deliver superior ROIs and measurable results on the business actions that matter most to them. Unlike our competitors, AdTheorent is already prepared for a cookie-less future, whether it comes tomorrow or years in the future. As stated previously, AdTheorent’s advantage is that our ad-targeting approach does not require us to know anything personally identifiable or sensitive about the user, including the user’s name, interests or website activity. We simply look at a moment in time – when a person accesses a piece of digital content – and we optimize media buying decisions based on the statistical likelihood of a given ad impression converting on a given customer KPI. The bid requests ingested by our platform include a number of different values and data points, including device type, operating system, one or more keywords in the URL, keywords in the page content, geographic data, time, or approximately 200 other data attributes that are available to inform our machine learning models. From there, there are microseconds in which AdTheorent and other DSPs are deciding whether to bid on that digital real estate. Our platform essentially says: “The bid request has these data elements present. What do our models tell us? Is this going to be valuable for a brand trying to sell sneakers online?” Our models are there to tell us that and make the best decision in an instant. Our platform evaluates more than one million impressions per second and we bid on less than 0.1% of those impressions. This is the magic of AdTheorent and why we are able to consistently drive high ROIs for our customers. This keeps our customers coming back and spending more with us over time. IPO Edge: What do you see as the next big thing in the digital advertising industry? Since 2012 the AdTheorent team has been working on the shared vision of ML-powered programmatic advertising. We’re not the product of acquisitions, tuck-ins or bolt-ons. We created AdTheorent from the ground up, we have a gifted CTO who is an ad tech pioneer and who has been here with his core team from day 1, and we will continue to rapidly innovate in the space and deliver the best results for our customers. This is the key going forward, as the the digital advertising industry will continue to grow and adapt, based on consumer behaviors and preferences. I believe there will be an evolution of AdTech towards machine learning-powered advertising, and AdTheorent is at the forefront of this shift. At its core, data science and machine learning are easier to practice in rhetorical form, as many companies do on websites and in marketing collateral. In practice, it is quite difficult to operationalize efficiently. Using data science and ML to target ads in microseconds is hard, especially when you consider the advanced KPIs our customers expect us to drive for them. It has taken AdTheorent a significant amount of time to build and refine our platform and solutions, and we have a great team of data scientists and engineers and product professionals who have helped us get here. We feel this has made for a deep, wide moat when compared to others in the space.

Workforce Automation Artificial Intelligence Concerns that emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and automation could wipe out wide swaths of American jobs aren’t backed up by data, according to a Sept. 13 report released by the nonprofit, nonpartisan Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. The report examines decades’ worth of data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics across 10 industries—construction, leisure and hospitality, professional and business services, retail trade, transportation and warehousing, wholesale trade, financial activities, information, education and health services, and manufacturing. The report found rates of job loss in each industry were lower in the third quarter of 2020 than in 1995. The third quarter of 2020 represented a stabilization of the American job market following a significant spike in job losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic that reached as high as 45% in the leisure and hospital industries. According to the report, U.S. workers have about a 5.8% chance of losing their jobs across those industries in any given quarter, down from 7.3% in 1995. “The prevailing narrative of accelerating job loss due to new technology is just a myth,” ITIF President Robert Atkinson, who co-authored the report, said in a statement. “The number of workers laid off each year as a share of all jobs has actually decreased steadily since the mid-1990s. Moreover, despite major employment disruption in the early stages of COVID-19, the rate of job loss has returned to the pre-pandemic trend line.” The report is a rebuttal to what ITIF calls the public’s “growing perception” that job insecurity is a staple of the modern tech-driven economy , as technology and automation become integral to everyday business. It warns that if public perception “misaligns with economic reality, there will likely be knock-on effects that could undermine growth—since pressure for stability build opposition to innovation and globalization.” “As unease grows, individuals may push lawmakers to enact stronger labor protections. But such laws could act as a drag on productivity if they limit the ability of firms to restructure work, as we see currently in Europe,” the report states. “Even more detrimental to innovation, workers and lawmakers may resist productivity-enhancing disruptions such as new information technologies or labor-saving robotics, even when such disruptions improve the economy. And they may pay attention to pundits calling for a tax on automation.” Share This: NEXT STORY: DOD Funds HBCUs to Advance Biotechnology and Materials Science Research Biden Administration Releases Draft Zero-Trust Guidance Postal Service Will Focus on Big Data, Digital Platforms Over Next 10 Years Air Force Wants to Spot Potential Outbreaks in Personnel Sooner with Wearables Swarms May Offer Next Level Artificial Intelligence Report: Hackers Shift from Malware to Credential Hijacking sponsor content Automatic Government Biden Administration Releases Draft Zero-Trust Guidance Postal Service Will Focus on Big Data, Digital Platforms Over Next 10 Years Air Force Wants to Spot Potential Outbreaks in Personnel Sooner with Wearables Swarms May Offer Next Level Artificial Intelligence Report: Hackers Shift from Malware to Credential Hijacking sponsor content Automatic Government X This website uses cookies to enhance user experience and to analyze performance and       traffic on our website.

A new dashboard launched today by the Johns Hopkins Center for Communication Programs (CCP) unpacks the survey findings and helps explain why—and how experts can work to increase acceptance rates. The center is based at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. The researchers found that the primary reasons around the world for resisting vaccination include fears about side effects, a desire to wait until more people have had the shots so they know they are safe, and a lack of confidence in whether the vaccine really works. These latest survey results, based on responses fielded between August 16 and 31, can be found in the new COVID Behaviors Dashboard. The new dashboard contains survey results based on responses from more than 12 million people from 115 countries, fielded every day since May 20, 2021. The survey—believed to be the world’s largest daily survey of global COVID knowledge, attitudes, and practices—is expected to continue until the end of this year and new data will become available every two weeks. The dashboard is intended to be used by policymakers, government officials, and public health practitioners at national and sub-national levels to better understand the behavioral drivers behind vaccine uptake, masking, and physical distancing that can prevent the spread of COVID-19. “Our analysis of this large trove of data finds that while vaccine hesitancy is real, there are many people around the globe who can be encouraged to get their doses—if public health officials can build and share their messages to address their concerns,” says Dominick Shattuck, PhD, CCP’s director of monitoring evaluation and learning and one of the leaders of the COVID behaviors project. Adds Marla Shaivitz, CCP’s director of digital strategy: “The dashboard can be used as a roadmap for policymakers to identify and engage with citizens to encourage them to be vaccinated to protect themselves and their families from COVID-19. In many countries, this dashboard fills an important data gap. It offers the most comprehensive data some governments have access to on how COVID behaviors are changing and what they can do to intervene.” The dashboard is the product of a collaboration among CCP, the World Health Organization’s Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network, and Facebook. The data are generated from the COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey, which is administered in the United States by the Delphi Group at Carnegie Mellon University and in other countries by the University of Maryland Social Data Science Center. The two universities collect the survey data from random samples of Facebook users and CCP analyzes the responses. A previous COVID behaviors dashboard , also led by CCP, was based on smaller, less frequent surveys from June 2020 through March 2021. In this latest survey, reasons for vaccine hesitancy vary by country. In Senegal, the two most common reasons for hesitancy are concerns about side effects and whether the vaccine is safe. Education around vaccine science and side effects could work to encourage vaccine uptake in Senegal. Respondents in the Netherlands were more likely than those in other countries to say that they don't believe they need a vaccine. When asked why not, their main reasons were because they are not a member of a high-risk group, or they don’t believe COVID-19 is a serious illness. Each underlying perception requires a different messaging response. The dashboard sheds light on how other behaviors have evolved over the last four months as well. In the United States, for example, 65 percent of those who responded to the survey between August 16 and 31 said they had been shopping indoors in the previous 24 hours, and two thirds of those who had been shopping said they wore masks. Mask wearing steadily decreased in the U.S. until the middle of July but has been rising since the highly transmissible Delta variant became the dominant strain, and case counts and hospitalizations began rising again to record levels in many states. In India, where an outbreak has fallen from its May peak, only 29 percent of respondents had been shopping indoors in the previous 24 hours and the vast majority of them (87 percent) were wearing masks, suggesting there is a long way to go before things get back to normal. Since March 2020, nearly 225 million COVID cases—and 4.6 million deaths—have been reported around the world, according to Johns Hopkins University ’s COVID-19 dashboard . More than 5.3 billion vaccine doses have been administered globally, though just over two percent of those doses have been administered in Africa. USAID has sent more than 110 million doses to low- and middle-income countries and COVAX, a worldwide initiative aimed at equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines, has distributed more than 236 million doses. As vaccine access increases, governments will need to develop strategies to sensitize citizens to accurate information and the benefits of vaccines. In addition to findings about vaccine hesitancy, the dashboard also features data on why many people who want vaccines can’t seem to access them. In Brazil, for example, where 65 percent of the unvaccinated respondents in the August 16–31 survey period said they probably or definitely want a vaccine, 23 percent of those who want one said they couldn’t get a shot because they are not eligible for one, and 34 percent said there were no appointments available. Armed with knowledge from the dashboard, officials in those countries can aim to work with local communities to make vaccine appointments more accessible—once vaccines are widely available—and to better spread the word about appointments that are available and when, where, and how to secure them. “We are at a critical time for global COVID-19 vaccine rollouts, yet populations are oversaturated with information, disinformation, and rumors,” says Jeni Stolow, PhD, MPH, Risk Communication and Community Engagement Focal Point at WHO’s Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network. “Continuously producing timely evidence-based and effective health communication is a major challenge in this second year of the pandemic. This dashboard can support public health practitioners around the globe in their endeavors to tailor, target, and reinvigorate their local COVID-19 vaccine outreach efforts.” While many unvaccinated people around the world say they are unlikely to get vaccinated, in many countries, large percentages of the population say they would choose to get their children vaccinated once a vaccine becomes available. In India and Guatemala, well over 90 percent of survey respondents said they would definitely or probably vaccinate their children. Data from August 16 through 31 show the figure was 86 percent in Mozambique, 72 percent in the United States, and 47 percent in Serbia. “The volume of data that has and will continue to be collected on COVID-19 will be of great value to policymakers and health practitioners, if the data are strategically used,” says Douglas Storey, PhD, CCP’s director for communication science and research. “This dashboard offers deep insights into behaviors around the world and will be a guide for those aiming to stop the spread of this devastating disease.” CCP is hosting a webinar about the new dashboard with experts from the center and WHO’s Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network on Tuesday, September 21, 2021, at 9:30 a.m., ET.

During the event, David Cieslak, Chief Data Scientist for Aunalytics, will discuss the use of natural language interface synthesis of SQL database queries leveraging the company’s new NL2SQL System. Natural language interface integration with database environments is a growing field that enables end users to interact with relational databases without technical database skills. These interfaces solve the problem of synthesizing SQL queries based on natural language input from the user. There are considerable research interests around the topic but there are few systems to date that are deployed on top of active enterprise data marts. At ECML-PKDD 2021, Aunalytics will introduce the NL2SQL system and present on data simulations that provide adaptive feedback for continuous model advancement. The architecture of the NL2SQL is built on WikiSQL data and research conducted by the data science team at Aunalytics. The company supports multiple scenarios using a unique table expansion process. The data simulation and the feedback loop help the model continuously adjust to linguistic variation introduced by the domain specific knowledge. “We are excited to explore this emerging area with the professionals attending ECML-PKDD 2021,” said David Cieslak, Chief Data Scientist, Aunalytics. “Advancements in natural language integration with today’s most widely deployed data marts is expected to improve business outcomes for financial institutions seeking next-level business intelligence.” The ECML-PKDD 2021 event is the premier European machine learning and data mining conference, building upon more than 19 years of successful events and conferences held across Europe.
