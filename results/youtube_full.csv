Musk has consistently warned us of the existential threat posed by advanced artificial intelligence in recent years. Despite this, he still feels that the issue is not properly understood. 
Many widely regarded scientist, like Steven Hawking, Steve Wozniak and Bill Gates, have already expressed their concerns that super-intelligent AI could escape our control and move against us. 
Musk lays out a number of possible scenarios for us to survive the rise of AI, if at all.
One of them is his neuroscience start-up, Neuralink. The company aims to implant wireless brain-computer interfaces that will link human brains directly to computers.
For Musk, brain computer interfaces are the only way the human race will survive the dangers of AI.

--

Today, artificial intelligence helps doctors diagnose patients, pilots fly commercial aircraft, and city planners predict traffic. These AIs are often self-taught, working off a simple set of instructions to create a unique array of rules and strategies. So how exactly does a machine learn? Briana Brownell digs into the three basic ways machines investigate, negotiate, and communicate.

We will use convolutional neural network for this image classification problem. First we will train a model using simple artificial neural network and then check how the performance looks like and then we will train a CNN and see how the model accuracy improves. This tutorial will help you understand why CNN is preferred over ANN for image classification.

BF4-7zXGjMs,I Want That Job!: Data Scientist,WorkingNation,https://youtube.com/watch?v=BF4-7zXGjMs,2020-12-03T01:58:54Z,People working in data science can collect raw information and present it to companies to help them understand their consumers' behaviors and also how to ...,"People working in data science can collect raw information and present it to companies to help them understand their consumers’ behaviors and also how to make better business decisions.

“In the last decade, economists have stressed the significance of processing, understanding, visualizing, and communicating insights from data, and how that's going to affect our immediate future. And the ability to do so effectively, is what gives the most successful companies out there, their competitive advantage today,” says Melissa Matalon, a technical program manager with Facebook.

A background in STEM-related education plus computer programming or modeling is one way to get into a data science job. Online learning opportunities, including classes and bootcamps are available to those who want to learn about the field.

Data analytic skills can be broadly applied to related roles in any industry. Matalon names a few, including health care, media, banking, and sports.

She adds, “Everyone is viewing content or purchasing items with a digital footprint. So all of these actions can now be tracked in almost real time using the latest technologies that are being created to process vast amounts of data. With all of this infrastructure in place now, what makes it so valuable is the people that have acquired the skills to translate this information from a jumble of numbers to actionable insights. I think this is why data scientists are so in demand across every industry.”

Eric Bradlow, vice dean of analytics at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, says the field of data analytics is recession-proof.

“Every industry needs people that can learn how to ingest data, analyze data, help companies, make business decisions through data. It's a set of skills that you would think, ‘Wow, you hear all these people doing data science.’ No, there's actually a shortage of people that can do data science. So as data science becomes a deeper and even more rich field, I think even more companies are going to have need for data scientists.”

In 2019, the median annual wage for a category that includes data scientists and mathematical science occupations was $94,280. This from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, abbreviated DARPA, or the Office of Advanced Research Projects of the U.S. Department of Defense, was established in 1958, almost immediately after the launch of the USSR Sputnik-1. The realization that the Soviets were about to launch into space not only satellites, but also missiles, greatly cheered up the government of the United States. The result was the creation of a unique agency with a huge budget, which could be spent at its own discretion. Watch a selection of the most unexpected, strange and advanced projects in the field of technology and artificial intelligence DARPA in one video!

In this video we scrape Wikipedia pages to create a dataset on Disney movies. 

The video is formatted with tasks for you to try to solve on your own throughout. For the best learning experience, at each task you should pause the video, try the task on your own, and then resume when you want to see how I would solve it.

We cover a wide range of Python & data science topics in this video. They include:
- Web scraping with BeautifulSoup
- Cleaning data
- Testing code with Pytest
- Pattern matching with regular expressions (Re library)
- Working with dates (datetime library)
- Saving & loading data with Pickle library
- Accessing data from an API using Requests library

About me 


Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

Today, we take a look at what Google's artificial intelligence just revealed.

Google’s DeepMind has made headlines for many reasons, but one of the most interesting news stories regarding the AI was that it learnt to be ‘highly aggressive’ in stressful situations. DeepMind was started in 2010 and joined Google in 2014 to accelerate its work. 

DeepMind’s notes it's recent progress, stating that “Our programs have learned to diagnose eye diseases as effectively as the world’s top doctors, to save 30% of the energy used to keep data centres cool, and to predict the complex 3D shapes of proteins - which could one day transform how drugs are invented.”

Here's how I made a real Harry Potter inspired invisibility cloak/shield using a digital passthrough system with AI software combined with lenticular lenses. The camera mounted on the back side of the screen sends images through an AI which generates a 3d view of the 2d input image. Then the front camera tracks the viewers location and projects alters the 3d image to display the correct prospective on the screen for that viewer. Lenticular lenses are also used to blend the digital image with the background as well as attempt to project a 3d stereoscopic view to the viewer (However this implementation still needs some work)

AI is a rapidly growing field of technology with the potential to make huge improvements in human wellbeing. However, the development of machines with intelligence vastly superior to humans will pose special, perhaps even unique risks.

Most surveyed AI researchers expect machines to eventually be able to rival humans in intelligence, though there is little consensus on when or how this will happen.

One only needs to accept three basic assumptions to recognize the inevitability of superintelligent AI:
- Intelligence is a product of information processing in physical systems.
- We will continue to improve our intelligent machines.
- We do not stand on the peak of intelligence or anywhere near it.

Philosopher Nick Bostrom expressed concern about what values a superintelligence should be designed to have.
Any type of AI superintelligence could proceed rapidly to its programmed goals, with little or no distribution of power to others. It may not take its designers into account at all. The logic of its goals may not be reconcilable with human ideals. The AI’s power might lie in making humans its servants rather than vice versa. If it were to succeed in this, it would “rule without competition under a dictatorship of one”.

Elon Musk has also warned that the global race toward AI could result in a third world war.
To avoid the ‘worst mistake in history’, it is necessary to understand the nature of an AI race, as well as escape the development that could lead to unfriendly Artificial Superintelligence. 

To ensure the friendly nature of artificial superintelligence, world leaders should work to ensure that this ASI is beneficial to the entire human race.

About me 

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :)

ซึ่งเกิดจาก ระยะเวลาในการส่งข้อมูลผ่าน network ดังนั้นวันนี้เราจึงจำเป็นต้องทำ Machine Learning เอง

แต่ว่า ถ้าทำเองมันคงเหนื่อยแน่ๆ ดังนั้นวันนี้เราจึงใช้ Teachable Machine ซึ่งช่วยให้เราสามารถ ทำ Machine Learning แบบไม่ต้องมีความรู้ (คือง่ายมาก)

แต่อย่างไรก็ตาม Teachable machine มันเหมาะกับงาน Machine learning best practice ไม่ซับซ้อน

ทำไมถึงเป็นอย่างงั้น ลองไปดูในคลิปได้เลย

Stephan R. Richter, Hassan Abu AlHaija, and Vladlen Koltun

Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04619
Code and data: https://github.com/isl-org/PhotorealismEnhancement
Project page: https://isl-org.github.io/PhotorealismEnhancement/

We present an approach to enhancing the realism of synthetic images. The images are enhanced by a convolutional network that leverages intermediate representations produced by conventional rendering pipelines. The network is trained via a novel adversarial objective, which provides strong supervision at multiple perceptual levels. We analyze scene layout distributions in commonly used datasets and find that they differ in important ways. We hypothesize that this is one of the causes of strong artifacts that can be observed in the results of many prior methods. To address this we propose a new strategy for sampling image patches during training. We also introduce multiple architectural improvements in the deep network modules used for photorealism enhancement. We confirm the benefits of our contributions in controlled experiments and report substantial gains in stability and realism in comparison to recent image-to-image translation methods and a variety of other baselines.",Dataset; Github; Image; Network; Objective-C; Rendering; Sampling; Training; Translation

Well, I quit about 2.5 years ago and then ended coming back to the profession. 

In this video I talk about the reasons why I quit data science to pursue a role as  business consultant and project owner. I break down my considerations and my experiences. 

I also talk about why I ended up coming back to data science after less than a year in this new role. 

I hope that this video helps you to better understand what goes into making a career decision. I also hope that you enjoy my admittedly weird sense of humor, dinosaurs, and papayas.

TmlBkW6ANsQ,The future of modern warfare: How technology is transforming conflict | DW Analysis,DW News,https://youtube.com/watch?v=TmlBkW6ANsQ,2021-06-04T15:05:06Z,"The world is entering a new era of warfare, with cyber and autonomous weapons taking center stage. These technologies are making militaries faster, smarter, ...","The world is entering a new era of warfare, with cyber and autonomous weapons taking center stage. These technologies are making militaries faster, smarter, more efficient. But if unchecked, they threaten to destabilize the world. 
DW takes a deep dive into the future of conflict, uncovering an even more volatile world. Where a cyber intrusion against a nuclear early warning system can unleash a terrifying spiral of escalation; where “flash wars” can erupt from autonomous weapons interacting so fast that no human could keep up. 
Germany’s Foreign Minister Heiko Maas tells DW that we have already entered the technological arms race that is propelling us towards this future. “We’re right in the middle of it. That’s the reality we have to deal with.” 
And yet the world is failing to meet the challenge. Talks on controlling autonomous weapons have repeatedly been stalled by major powers seeking to carve out their own advantage. And cyber conflict has become not just a fear of the future but a permanent state of affairs.
DW finds out what must happen to steer the world in a safer direction, with leading voices from the fields of politics, diplomacy, intelligence, academia, and activism speaking out.

Go to https://buyraycon.com/bumper for 15% off your order! Brought to you by Raycon.

For well over a century, cars, trucks, and SUV’s have been manufactured and built in the same fashion. Today, though, there’s a company that’s doing things a bit different. The Czinger 21C is one of the most impressive vehicles ever built. Even more impressive than the car, though, is how the car gets designed and made. We’re going to take a look at how artificial intelligence, with the help of 3D printing, may change the entire automotive industry, and how a small team in California could make it happen sooner than you think.

In the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, technology is helping Lisa do what she loves: understand more about these massive marine mammals so that they stand a better chance at survival.

The Big Idea is a short documentary series that seeks out people who look at the world differently—as they experiment with novel approaches to reinventing industries and lives, not the least of which are their own. There’s a whole world out there that’s ready to be reshaped. All it takes is one big idea.

Nathan Shipley is a San Francisco based artist who uses latest digital technology and in particular Artificial Intelligence to create some pretty cool artistic stuff. In 2018 he used Deepfake technology to bring to life Salvador Dali for the Dali Museum in Florida, who was able to talk and interact with visitors. In his latest project, using machine learning and generative art, he is exploring how artificial intelligence recreates historical figures from paintings. Please check video where some of his work is presented and see real faces of historical figures. And a warning again, please don't freak out, I've added some subtle animation to give them additional layer of realism. Enjoy.

About me 

Hi, my name is Tina and I'm a data scientist at a FAANG company. I was pre-med studying pharmacology at the University of Toronto until I finally accepted that I would make a terrible doctor. I didn't know what to do with myself so I worked for a year as a research assistant for a bioinformatics lab where I learned how to code and became interested in data science. I then did a masters in computer science (MCIT) at the University of Pennsylvania before ending up at my current job in tech :) 

I have accepted that I will forever be a lazy person so have since decided to embrace that. My motto is to always minimize effort and maximize outcome!

I investigate the concept of artificial intelligence in minecraft and talk about how deep learning / machine learning / ai can lead to unique concepts within the game that we might've not even considered. Even Dream and Technoblade wouldn't be able to optimize as survival as well as an advanced AI. 

I had a lot of fun creating this script talking with many different machine learning researchers at universities like Cornell, ASU, UCLA, and Duke. The style of this video is similar to VSauce, Veritasium and Wifies in parts. A large influence on this educational series has come from content creators like VSauce, Veritasium, and Wifies.",Artificial Intelligence (AI); Beats; Deep Learning; Machine Learning; Play; Training; Twitter; Video

Suggestion - agar aap bilkul new hain to aap angel broking aur Upstox dono me Free account open kar sakte hain kyuki apko koi bhi payment nahi krni hogi aur share buy and sell karte time 1 month brokerage bhi nahi dena hoga
to aap dono demat account ko free use kar ke ache se seekh sakte hain baad me apko jo acha lagega ap usse regular use kar sakte hain aur chahe to sabhi ko bhi use kar sakte hain kyuki jaroori nahi ki aap 1 hi account khole aap chahe to sabhi companies me demat account khol sakte hain. Mera in teeno me Demat account hai kuch ko me long term ke lia use krta hu, kuch ko intraday trading ke lia.

With Artificial Intelligence, the future is faster than you think. Human development in just 100+ years became global and grown exponential. We are witnessing rapid growth, and exponential technologies drive it with the availability of faster and cheaper computing power. Artificial Intelligence is one such Exponential technologies that are reinventing every business model and ecosystem.  Let's quickly revisit to understand the difference between the linear and exponential scale. If your walk is 1 meter, 30 steps of 1meter will take you 30 meters from the starting point. Whereas 30 such exponential steps lead to over 1 billion meters. 
Not only in our lives, but we also see it in stocks as well. Also, in the known brands, for example, see the Netflix growth, its valuation, a decade back is linear at 2.2Billion$, and now, it is more than 300 billion. Remember, such growth can cause disruptive stress or opportunity. For example, photos taken each year have grown exponentially and, simultaneously, analogue photos have fallen exponentially. At present we have 20B+ connected devices and more than 1 trillion sensors. It is projected another exponential growth here. Hence, an explosion of data ahead and we are heading to data-driven AI. Companies have to transform themselves to sustain themselves in the future. 
Sundar Pichia says ""Artificial intelligence could have  more profound implications for  humanity than electricity or fire.” 
Elon Musk says ""Companies have to race to build AI or they will be made uncompetitive. Essentially, if  your competitor is racing to  build AI, they will crush you.”
“There will be two kinds of companies at the end of this decade…. …those who are using AI. …and those who are out of business.” We started seeing AI in drone deliveries, autonomous vehicles, Flying cars, Robots, and service industries where AI beat humans on all fronts. The decade ahead is Human-AI collaboration, In what industries? And what are the companies which have revenues from AI-enabled streams? If we look at the US stock markets, AI companies are well classified as a segment and operating in different sectors health care, finance, transportation, construction, manufacturing, education, etc including cross-industry tech. 
For Indian stock market, Sectors such as FMCG, Pharma, Cement, IT, etc are well organized, here, for Artificial intelligence, there is no separate sector or segment. I have attempted to classify 30 stocks based on the criteria of at least 40% revenue contribution from AI or AI-enabled products and services. Valuations are always premium, and these stocks try to catch the exponential price curve after the end of each consolidation phase.

|Hello friends, did you know? Robots are planning to destroy all human beings in the world? Yeah, I am not kidding!! Just like in Iron Man: Age of Ultron movie, where AI robot was destroying human lives, similarly in real life Bina-48 robot said in an interview that if it was able to hack nuclear missiles, then it will control and rule the entire world!! Yes, you heard me right! Even our world-famous female robot Sophie told in an interview that she will destroy the human race in the future. Now, what are your views on this? Will Artificial intelligence really kill us all? Should we be really afraid? Well, stay tuned to know more in our today's video.

It is the next 'big thing' after all. But in this video I'm going to be telling you why you should NOT learn machine learning. 

There are many reasons for not starting machine learning. Some of these are:
1. Don't get into ML just because it is popular. Basically do not FOMO into it.
2. Machine learning is a huge field, there are so many things to do. You might start it but eventually give up because you don't know what exactly you want to build using ML/AI.
3. Just because you saw people getting paid more for machine learning jobs doesn't mean you should start it. As you can still polish your skills in other computer science related fields.

Even though I mention why you should not be get into machine learning, this doesn't mean that you should not at least give it a go. This video is only made for some people who want to get into ML/AI without having any major goal.

Let me know what you think about this in the comment section below.

TO BE CLEAR I still think it is possible for anyone to break into this field, but I also think it is important to set realistic expectations.

1) Educational Burden - Data science is a multidisciplinary field. You need to learn computer science, coding, and subject area knowledge. You really need to invest many hours into this endeavor. 
- Project Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2zq7klxX5AReJn7nZfqOKLZ3IpKj7fwc
- Kaggle Courses (Free): https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview
- 365 Data Science (57% Discount): https://365datascience.pxf.io/P0jbBY

2) Market Saturation - There is a huge supply of entry level data scientists. With more people, that means the probability of landing a data science job is lower. 

3) Data Science isn't a good fit for you - It takes a lot of time and dedication to break into this field. It helps to be very passionate about the work. There are other great careers like software engineering that have a lower barrier to entry where you make similar income (if not more).

4) Ambiguity - Data science job postings are very unclear / unreliable.

5) Continued learning - You need to be adaptable in your role. It takes habits or huge motivation to keep studying. 

Congratulations! If you made it this far you likely have one of the most important skills for breaking into this field. 

That skill is GRIT.

Большие данные, методы и результаты их обработки – это то, что окружает каждого из нас почти в любой момент времени - когда мы делаем покупки в супермаркете, едем на учебу или работу, когда мы летим отдыхать и даже прямо сейчас - когда вы смотрите этот фильм. Данные – это наша жизнь. А наука о них – это то, что нашу жизнь определяет.
 
«Data Science. Будущее уже здесь» – это видео-проект, в рамках которого ты узнаешь, чем занимаются дата сайентисты в компаниях, и решишь, интересна ли тебе эта работа.

Специальный гость проекта – Валерий Бабушкин, Team lead по безопасности личных данных в Facebook и Kaggle Grandmaster. Валерий Бабушкин – один из лучших специалистов по data science в России и мире. Экс-преподаватель проекта Data Culture в НИУ ВШЭ, ранее руководил группой аналитики Яндекс.Советник, был вице-президентом по машинному обучению в Alibaba Group и директором по Data Science в X5 Retail Group.

Well, you’ve come to the right place. 

After this two-part code-first introduction, you’ll have written 100s of lines of TensorFlow code and have hands-on experience with two important problems in machine learning: regression (predicting a number) and classification (predicting if something is one thing or another).

Open a Google Colab (if you’re not sure what this is, you’ll find out soon) window and get ready to code along.

The company is also releasing new RTX GPUs (the A4000, A5000, A6000).

We're already half-way through our initial new GN 'Volt' Large Modmat inventory. Grab one on the store if you want it this round: https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/modmat-volt-large
You can also pick up an Original Modmat (also in stock & shipping) on the store: https://store.gamersnexus.net/products/modmat

NVIDIA's GTC 2021 conference saw the unveil of a series of new GPUs for professionals and data center applications, but all of these were overshadowed by NVIDIA's renewed interest in the CPU space. NVIDIA has been trying to purchase ARM since 2020 (currently pending regulatory approval), and in the meantime, the two organizations are working together to produce the new NVIDIA Grace CPU for data center and server applications. The NVIDIA Grace CPU aims to improve bandwidth of CPU-to-GPU communications and CPU-to-CPU communications, outperforming traditional PCIe signaling with NVIDIA's NVLink.

The GPUs announced are part of the former Quadro line, branding that NVIDIA is slowly moving away from. The A5000 and A4000 GPUs are in the high-end of Ampere RTX cards, with mobile versions also available in Max-Q laptops.

Separately from all of this, NVIDIA talked more about its Omniverse software and a few RTX games, including Black Myth: Wukong, Boundary, Narak: Bladepoint, and Bright Memory. Cyberpunk also got a comically short pseudo-reference.

The resume is the key to getting that interview, which is definitely the hardest part of the entire application process for a data scientist. Our role is super popular but actual positions few and far between. That's why I spent A LOT of time on this resume to get my foot in the door. We're going to go through this line by line and item by item as I go into the details and roast it hard. Sit back and enjoy! :)

In this video, I'll share with you what a typical work week is for me. I like keeping myself really busy (what a masochist right?) so outside of my day job as a data scientist at a tech company, I also volunteer at a non-profit, help teach a data science class, and obviously create content for YouTube. Because of proprietary reasons, I can't share the specifics of what I do at my day job but I hope this video will give you all a bit more insight into my day-to-day. This video is long overdue but I hope you enjoy!

xx, 
Jules
