The older brother of NGINX is Apache Web Server. It's one of the most popular ones and a very old web server, as it exists for about 25 years.

Like other web services, Apache performs the behind the scenes actions that return the website from the server to the browser.

When the user opens the browser and enters the website's address, he would like to see the request is sent to the server, and the server returns the proper resources to the browser. Apache is the software that takes part in the process and proves a smooth and secure HTTP communication between those two parties.

Apache has a modular structure and is highly customizable. Server admins can turn on and off the web server's additional features, and custom server configuration can be set through the .htaccess files.

The main disadvantage of the Apache Web Server is performance issues when the website has very heavy traffic.

The other web services that can be used are NGINX or Tomcat Apache.

#DBMS #DatabaseManagementSystem #Database
What is Data?
Data means raw facts that are unorganized and can be recorded and are implicit.

What is Information?
When data is processed in a given context so as to make it useful, it is called information.
What is Database?
A Database is collection of data that is related to each other.
Criterion for a Database
Database should represent real world or so called mini world, so that changes in the real world should be reflected in the database.
Database should be a collection of logical and coherent data and not some random data.
A database should be created with 3 things in mind: 
       a. A specific purpose
       b. An intended group of users
       c. A preconceived application that these intended        
           users have in mind.
DBMS: A database management system or DBMS  is a collection of programs that enables users to create and maintain a database.
Purposes of DBMS
 The DBMS is a general-purpose software system that facilitates the processes of defining, constructing, manipulating, and sharing databases among various users and applications.
Defining database
 specifying the data types, structures, and constraints of the data to be stored in the database.
Database Construction
 Constructing the database is the process of storing the data on some storage device.
Database Manipulation
Manipulating a database includes functions such as querying the database, updating the data etc.

Visualizations - How to Win a Data Science Competition: Learn from Top Kagglers
Advanced Machine Learning Specialization
If you want to break into competitive data science, then this course is for you! Participating in predictive modelling competitions can help you gain practical experience, improve and harness your data modelling skills in various domains such as credit, insurance, marketing, natural language processing, sales‚Äô forecasting and computer vision to name a few. At the same time you get to do it in a competitive context against thousands of participants where each one tries to build the most predictive algorithm. Pushing each other to the limit can result in better performance and smaller prediction errors. Being able to achieve high ranks consistently can help you accelerate your career in data science.

In this course, you will learn to analyse and solve competitively such predictive modelling tasks. 

When you finish this class, you will:

- Understand how to solve predictive modelling competitions efficiently and learn which of the skills obtained can be applicable to real-world tasks.
- Learn how to preprocess the data and generate new features from various sources such as text and images.
- Be taught advanced feature engineering techniques like generating mean-encodings, using aggregated statistical measures or finding nearest neighbors as a means to improve your predictions.
- Be able to form reliable cross validation methodologies that help you benchmark your solutions and avoid overfitting or underfitting when tested with unobserved (test) data. 
- Gain experience of analysing and interpreting the data. You will become aware of inconsistencies, high noise levels, errors and other data-related issues such as leakages and you will learn how to overcome them. 
- Acquire knowledge of different algorithms and learn how to efficiently tune their hyperparameters and achieve top performance. 
- Master the art of combining different machine learning models and learn how to ensemble. 
- Get exposed to past (winning) solutions and codes and learn how to read them.

Disclaimer : This is not a machine learning course in the general sense. This course will teach you how to get high-rank solutions against thousands of competitors with focus on practical usage of machine learning methods rather than the theoretical underpinnings behind them.

Prerequisites: 
- Python: work with DataFrames in pandas, plot figures in matplotlib, import and train models from scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM.
- Machine Learning: basic understanding of linear models, K-NN, random forest, gradient boosting and neural networks.

This course is fantastic. It's chock full of practical information that is presented clearly and concisely. I would like to thank the team for sharing their knowledge so generously.,I really enjoyed this course but it was probably 2-3 times more work than I anticipated. Most of that extra time comes from working on the final project, testing things out, etc.
We will start this week with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). It is a very broad and exciting topic and an essential component of solving process. Besides regular videos you will find a walk through EDA process for Springleaf competition data and an example of prolific EDA for NumerAI competition with extraordinary findings.

---------------------------------


Why Learn Natural Language Processing  or NLP?

Natural Language Processing (or Text Analytics/Text Mining) applies analytic tools to learn from collections of text data, like social media, books, newspapers, emails, etc. The goal can be considered to be similar to humans learning by reading such material. However, using automated algorithms we can learn from massive amounts of text, very much more than a human can. It is bringing a new revolution by giving rise to chatbots and virtual assistants to help one system address queries of millions of users.

NLP is a branch of artificial intelligence that has many important implications on the ways that computers and humans interact. Human language, developed over thousands and thousands of years, has become a nuanced form of communication that carries a wealth of information that often transcends the words alone. NLP will become an important technology in bridging the gap between human communication and digital data.

LECTURE Part A: http://bit.ly/pDL-en-10-1
In this section, we understand the motivation behind Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), define what it is and see some of its applications in NLP and Computer Vision. We understand how pretext tasks aid with SSL and see some example pretext tasks in images, videos and videos with sound. Finally, we try to get an intuition behind the representation learned by pretext tasks.

LECTURE Part B: http://bit.ly/pDL-en-10-2
In this section, we discuss the shortcomings of pretext tasks, define characteristics that make a good pretrained feature, and how we can achieve this using Clustering and Contrastive Learning. We then learn about ClusterFit, its steps and performance. We further dive into a specific simple framework for Contrastive Learning known as PIRL. We discuss its working as well as its evaluation in different contexts.

They're fast and super scalable but how do they work?

Behind-the-scenes, they use a keyspace to distribute your data across multiple servers or partitions. This allows them to scale horizontally across many thousand servers.

NoSQL databases can operate in multiple modes: as key-value store, document store or wide column store.

You can run your own NoSQL database with software like Cassandra, CouchDB, MongoDB or Scylla. You can also use a cloud version like AWS DynamoDB, Google Cloud BigTable or Azure CosmosDB.

Yes or no, that is the question.

NoSQL stands for not only SQL, not ""no SQL"".

I know that. You'll understand NoSQL better if you learn SQL first.

NoSQL seems to be trending right now. It's the hot database tool to use these days.

However, it is much more advanced than standard SQL. And it is harder to learn.

NoSQL has a lot of advanced features and scales up quickly.

MySQL is used by a lot of apps, while NoSQL is only of benefit to around 1% of projects. Relational data is better suited for SQL databases than NoSQL, and most data these days is relational.

It's all relative. NoSQL is bleeding edge technology.

NoSQL is so new that it has no standard engine or interface. Wait until they finalize it before you try to learn it or you'll run your wheels off trying to keep up.

So I get to be the first out the door and in the marketplace to say I know it.

MySQL has a better certification program. You can show them the credentials to say you're qualified to handle a MySQL database.

NoSQL has agile sprints and can handle regular code pushes.

It has to, given how quickly it is trying to get to a finished state.

NoSQL uses some of the cutting edge technologies to handle unstructured data storage and replication.

It is used by MongoDB and HBase. But hiring managers have only heard of Oracle and MySQL.

Companies will catch on.

So start with MySQL. There are more jobs in that right now.

You think that by the time I learn NoSQL by the time people will start migrating to it.

And you have to know both databases to effectively migrate them anyway.

What is Java?
Java is an object-oriented, class-based, high-level programming language used for software development, mobile application development, website development, desktop application development, and much more. Java is one of the leading and in-demand programming languages in the current IT industry.

What is Javascript?
JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user.

Hi! My name is Ben Wilson and I'm a Data Scientist and mathematician. We're here to learn about unsupervised learning in Python.

Unsupervised learning is a class of machine learning techniques for discovering patterns in data. For instance, finding the natural ""clusters"" of customers based on their purchase histories, or searching for patterns and correlations among these purchases, and using these patterns to express the data in compressed form. These are examples of unsupervised learning techniques called ""clustering"" and ""dimension reduction"".

Unsupervised learning is defined in opposition to supervised learning. An example of supervised learning is using the measurements of tumors to classify them as benign or cancerous. In this case, the pattern discovery is guided, or ""supervised"", so that the patterns are as useful as possible for predicting the label: benign or cancerous. Unsupervised learning, in contrast, is learning without labels. It is pure pattern discovery, unguided by a prediction task. You'll start by learning about clustering. But before we begin, let's introduce a dataset and fix some terminology.

The iris dataset consists of the measurements of many iris plants of three different species. There are four measurements: petal length, petal width, sepal length and sepal width. These are the features of the dataset.

Throughout this course, datasets like this will be written as two-dimensional numpy arrays. The columns of the array will correspond to the features. The measurements for individual plants are the samples of the dataset. These correspond to rows of the array.

The samples of the iris dataset have four measurements, and so correspond to points in a four-dimensional space. This is the dimension of the dataset. We can't visualise four dimensions directly, but using unsupervised learning techniques we can still gain insight.

In this chapter, we'll cluster these samples using k-means clustering. k-means finds a specified number of clusters in the samples. It's implemented in the scikit-learn or ""sklearn"" library. Let's see kmeans in action on some samples from the iris dataset. The iris samples are represented as an array.

To start, import kmeans from scikit-learn. Then create a kmeans model, specifying the number of clusters you want to find. Let's specify 3 clusters, since there are three species of iris. Now call the fit method of the model, passing the array of samples. This fits the model to the data, by locating and remembing the regions where the different clusters occur. Then we can use the predict method of the model on these same samples. This returns a cluster label for each sample, indicating to which cluster a sample belongs. Let's assign the result to labels, and print it out.

If someone comes along with some new iris samples, k-means can determine to which clusters they belong without starting over. k-means does this by remembering the mean (or average) of the samples in each cluster. These are called the ""centroids"". New samples are assigned to the cluster whose centroid is closest.

Suppose you've got an array of new samples. To assign the new samples to the existing clusters, pass the array of new samples to the predict method of the kmeans model. This returns the cluster labels of the new samples.

In the next video, you'll learn how to evaluate the quality of your clustering. But for now, let's visualise our clustering of the iris samples using scatter plots. Here is a scatter plot of the sepal length vs petal length of the iris samples. Each point represents an iris sample, and is colored according to the cluster of the sample. To create a scatter plot like this, use PyPlot.

Firstly, import PyPlot. It is conventionally imported as plt. Now get the x- and y- co-ordinates of each sample. Sepal length is in the 0th column of the array, while petal length is in the 2nd column. Now call the plt dot scatter function, passing the x- and y- co-ordinates and specifying c=labels to colour by cluster label. When you are ready to show your plot, call plt dot show. should i get that It's time to take your first steps in unsupervised learning. Have fun!

Description: Complex machine learning models such as deep convolutional neural networks and recursive neural networks have made great progress in a wide range of computer vision applications, such as object/scene recognition, image caption-ing, visual question answering. But they are often perceived as black-boxes. As models are going deeper in search of better recognition accuracy, it becomes even harder to understand the predictions given by the models and why. This tutorial is to broadly engage the computer vision community with the topic of interpretability and explainability in models used in comput-er vision. We will introduce the definition of interpretability and why it is important, and have a review on visualization and interpretation methodologies for analyzing both the data and the models in computer vision.

Read the full article: https://www.excelcampus.com/powerquery/convert-text-to-time-values-power-query/

In a previous video (https://youtu.be/uhzLYTupl9I) I shared this challenge to convert time/duration stored as text into time values that can be used for calculations and analytics.

Thanks to everyone that commented on the video and blog post with solutions.   In this video we look at a solution posted by Walt.

The solution uses Power Query to extract/split the time components (hours, minutes, seconds into separate columns.  We then merge the columns and convert the data type to a duration.

Checkout these articles if you are new to Power Query:

2MR5UynQocs,Data Preparation vs. Data Wrangling Comparison in Machine Learning / Deep Learning,Kai W√§hner,https://youtube.com/watch?v=2MR5UynQocs,2017-02-13T10:48:29Z,"Data Preparation: Comparison of Programming Languages, Frameworks and Tools for Data Preprocessing and (Inline) Data Wrangling in Machine Learning ...",9.0,Data Preparation,"Data Preparation: Comparison of Programming Languages, Frameworks and Tools for Data Preprocessing and (Inline) Data Wrangling  in Machine Learning / Deep Learning Projects.

A key task to create appropriate analytic models in machine learning or deep learning is the integration and preparation of data sets from various sources like files, databases, big data storages, sensors or social networks. This step can take up to 80% of the whole project.

This session compares different alternative techniques to prepare data, including extract-transform-load (ETL) batch processing (like Talend, Pentaho), streaming analytics ingestion (like Apache Storm, Flink, Apex, TIBCO StreamBase, IBM Streams, Software AG Apama), and data wrangling (DataWrangler, Trifacta) within visual analytics. Various options and their trade-offs are shown in live demos using different advanced analytics technologies and open source frameworks such as R, Python, Apache Hadoop, Spark, KNIME or RapidMiner. The session also discusses how this is related to visual analytics tools (like TIBCO Spotfire), and best practices for how the data scientist and business user should work together to build good analytic models.

Key takeaways for the audience:
-    Learn various options for preparing data sets to build analytic models
-    Understand the pros and cons and the targeted persona for each option
-    See different technologies and open source frameworks for data preparation
-    Understand the relation to visual analytics and streaming analytics, and how these concepts are actually leveraged to build the analytic model after data preparation

Most of the institues are mis guiding students as they want to up sell and sell one more class and take more fees from students.
Sometimes, teachers just want to reduce their work as students who is already aware of concepts like class and inheritance is easier to teach same concept with different syntax in java.

Hello and welcome to this session with AcadGild. We are going learn about NoSQL database in Big Data. Let‚Äôs start with some essential facts on NoSQL Database.

Before that, check out the previous sessions:

‚Ä¢ NoSQL databases stands for not only SQL or not SQL.
‚Ä¢ It is a specific acronym given to a new type of databases which has evolved owing to the restrictions and challenges with the traditional databases.
‚Ä¢ Traditional RDBMS uses SQL syntax and queries to analyze and get data 

So, what were the challenges is traditional RDBMS that leads to the evolution of NoSQL?

Let‚Äôs find out:
‚Ä¢ Not optimized for horizontal scaling out
‚Ä¢ Schema-less data
‚Ä¢ High Velocity of data ingestion
All these together led to the evolution of NoSQL database.

Now Let‚Äôs Have a Look at the features of NoSQL Database.
‚Ä¢ Generic Data Model
‚Ä¢ Dynamic type discovery and conversion

The conversions between the data using NoSQL is implicit. 
‚Ä¢ Non-Related and De-normalized
‚Ä¢ Highly Distributable

Besides, NoSQL database can be built in a cluster of commodity hardware as they are highly distributable. 
‚Ä¢ Commodity Hardware 

NoSQL databases are based on the core principle of supporting horizontal scaling out.

NoSQL DATABASE TYPES 

Having learned about the features, let‚Äôs now explore the NoSQL data types:

The first type is:
‚Ä¢ Document Databases
The second type of NoSQL data type is:
‚Ä¢ Graph Stores

CAP Theorem

We will now talk about an important theorem in NoSQL databases. NoSQL databases are meant for distributed storage. This can be explained by something like, suppose you are having a particular table which contains id and age. There are ids present starting from one and two till one thousand. It makes sense to have it in one machine where you can store ids from 1 to 250. The id‚Äôs 251 to 500 you can store in another machine and so on. Ultimately, we require 4 machines with the final machine having the ids from 751 to 1000. This means you distribute the data by storing them across different machines. This is how the distribution works and assume that this is the design you are following. Let‚Äôs get ahead with the challenges that we will come across in this case.

CAP stands for Consistency Availability and Partition Tolerance.  

Consistency means the data in the database must be consistent before and after the execution. Suppose there are multiple users, in such case, every user should see the same data.

Availability of the system should be always up and running even in case if a few machines go down. It should be able to operate the working machines.

And finally, it should be partitioned tolerant even if the own machine goes down. This machine going down should not hamper the working of the other machines.

Cassandra is closer towards availability whereas HBase is closer towards consistency.

This brings us to a final question for this particular videos which is the use case. Let us assume that we have 1000 applications which access a NoSQL database for lookup. The lookup table is a static one and the content gets refreshed less frequently. If the application can tolerate working with stale data as well, which category of NoSQL database should one opt for?

‚Ä¢ CA
‚Ä¢ AP
‚Ä¢ CP
‚Ä¢ Either CA or AP, but not CP

AP is available and partition tolerant, CP is consistent and partition tolerant. Give it a thought and you will find that if your answer is AP, then you are right as in this design, consistency is far less important. We can tolerate with a stale data and availability is more important since we are having 1000 applications which need to access that table for lookup. Consistency is less important in this regard, more so as there is less change on the lookup table for the lookup table is less static. 

With that, I hope you have got an understanding of what exactly NoSQL databases are, what are the different categories of databases and what is a CAP theorem. Thank you so much for watching this video, stay tuned to AcadGild videos for a further introduction to different ecosystem components.

And get this, it's not that complicated! This video is the first part in a series that walks through it one step at a time. This video focuses on the main ideas behind using Gradient Boost to predict a continuous value, like someone's weight. We call this, ""using Gradient Boost for Regression"". In the next video, we'll work through the math to prove that Gradient Boost for Regression really is this simple. In part 3, we'll walk though how Gradient Boost classifies samples into two different categories, and in part 4, we'll go through the math again, this time focusing on classification.

3tSFZxEizCk,Should I Learn Matlab or Python?,Techy Help,https://youtube.com/watch?v=3tSFZxEizCk,2014-03-20T02:34:07Z,Should I learn Matlab or Python? Learn Matlab is you need it to verify your Calculus one and two homework. What about Python? That will actually get you a job ...,18.0,Matlab,"Should I learn Matlab or Python?

Learn Matlab is you need it to verify your Calculus one and two homework.

What about Python?

That will actually get you a job in computer science.

Why is Matlab so popular with colleges as a mathematics problem solver?

Matlab is cheaper than rivals like Mathematica and Maple, and it creates some great plots.

I think the professors are plotting to make their jobs as easy as possible.

And while you could solve any problem you have in Python code, troubleshooting an error requires an understanding of the math problem, the code problem and the logical error.

It's like when a guy had a math model that was so complicated that A + B = C but C -- B = 1.5. They couldn't figure out the solution so he couldn't get his thesis.

Which is why math professors prefer homework to be done in Matlab over programming languages.

The engineering program uses Fortran and Python.

That's because they are training engineers to code as well as problem solve. And they know that the engineers will be working with finite elements analysis software, structural analysis software and other tools written in Python.

Or Fortran.

It might as well be Greek to me, for all the use it is to me.

When is Matlab a good solution?

Matlab works well when you need to solve something symbolically or do a matrix. Python requires you to vectorize everything, which is good if you are doing vector analysis but not Calculus or linear algebra.

I think I get the picture.

If you need a plot or diagram, Matlab is the way to go. It is very hard to plot a graph, chart or much of anything with Python.

So learn Matlab if I'm doing undergraduate math and learn Python for everything else.

Well, Quicken or Turbotax for your accounting, though that's math you should be able to do with a calculator the rest of the time.",Accounting; Analysis; C; Calculus; Chart; Computer Science; Engineering; Fortran; Golang; Graph; Linear Algebra; MATLAB; Mathematics; Programming Language Theory; Python; R; Training

What is KNN?
K-Nearest Neighbors is one of the simplest supervised machine learning algorithms used for classification. It classifies a data point based on its neighbors‚Äô classifications. It stores all available cases and classifies new cases based on similar features. 

When Do We Use the KNN Algorithm?
The KNN algorithm is used in the following scenarios:
‚úÖData is labeled
‚úÖData is noise-free
‚úÖDataset is small, as KNN is a lazy learner

Pros and Cons of Using KNN
‚úÖPros:  Since the KNN algorithm requires no training before making predictions, new data can be added seamlessly, which will not impact the accuracy of the algorithm.
KNN is very easy to implement. There are only two parameters required to implement KNN‚Äîthe value of K and the distance function (e.g. Euclidean, Manhattan, etc.)
‚úÖCons: The KNN algorithm does not work well with large datasets. The cost of calculating the distance between the new point and each existing point is huge, which degrades performance.
Feature scaling (standardization and normalization) is required before applying the KNN algorithm to any dataset. Otherwise, KNN may generate wrong predictions.

‚úÖKNN Algorithm Uses in Real World
In the real world, the KNN algorithm has applications for both classification and regression problems. KNN is widely used in almost all industries, such as healthcare, financial services, eCommerce, political campaigns, etc. Healthcare companies use the KNN algorithm to determine if a patient is susceptible to certain diseases and conditions. Financial institutions predict credit card ratings or qualify loan applications and the likelihood of default with the help of the KNN algorithm.

Applying Graph Theory to Infrastructure

Graphs are mathematical structures used to model relationships between objects. Modern infrastructures can be thought of as graphs - compute resource depend on network resources, which in turn depend on access control resources, and so on. At a certain scale, the relationships between all resources in an infrastructure become impractical to reason about.

Terraform builds a graph to model the relationships between resources so operators can safely manage and change infrastructure resources across bare metal, IaaS, PasS, and SaaS. Terraform models and potentially prevents that simple change with unforeseen consequences so operators don't have to.

In this talk, we will explore the graph theory at the heart of Terraform's orchestration engine. --

C++ is one of the four languages used to develop apps for Windows ...",42.0,C++,"Why learn C++ programming when there are so many other options, like C or Objective C?

C++ is one of the four languages used to develop apps for Windows 8.

As if anyone cares about Windows 8.

A large part of MySQL and Adobe were written in C++.

Adobe Flash is being replaced by HTML5, the same way Flash supplanted Silverlight by Microsoft.

Back in the so called good old days, C++ was a big language -- especially in the 1980s.

C++ might have been the programming language you learned in school. Or it is what the professors taught because that was big in their heyday, which is obsolete now.

In 2000, Microsoft released a version of C++ compatible with dot-net.

Microsoft proved it was past its prime when they stopped supporting Windows XP, despite a quarter of all PCs using it. And lot of Linux programs are written in C, not C++.

C can not handle major text processing or object handling; for that, you need C++.

It is not like I'm planning on writing a blog. And a lot of languages can handle forms.

C++ is popular for gaming development. It used to be the only option for multiplayer games over networks and 3D games because it offered greater control over audio and video output.

You can build games in Java and Lua, too.

C was easier to learn because it had a smaller vocabulary, and every hardware manufacturer has a compiler for it. The same has carried over to C++.

So now we're down to using it for the operating system and not much else.

C++ is commonly used in the open source market.

Mostly because of the C++ and Windows ties. Python and other languages are more popular because they are easier to learn.

Learn C++ to create drivers, control audio cards, build games and enterprise apps. You'll literally have the skills to work from micro to macro.",.NET Framework; Audio; Blogging; C++; Compiler; Extreme Programming (XP); Hardware; Java; Linux; Lua; Market; Microsoft; MySQL; Network; Objection Handling; Objective-C; Operating System; Processing; Programming Language; Python; Video; Windows; Writing

A few of these data storytelling tips include:

- Our eyes don't follow a specific order, so you need to create that order.
- Our eyes first focus on what stands out, so be intentional with your focal point.
- Our eyes can only handle a few things at once, so don't overcrowd your design.

HOW TO GIVE A PRESENTATION IN A JOB INTERVIEW
--------------------

Ever been asked to give a presentation in a job interview?

As in, your basic, are you kidding me?

It‚Äôs especially common for high communication positions such as sales or marketing, but this is something everyone should understand and know how to do well.

After I share the 6 C‚Äôs employers look for when a job candidate gives a presentation, I‚Äôll teach you the exact content for your presentation‚Äîthe content that persuades.

It‚Äôs a very similar structure you can use when answering any job interview question.

This will be so much more than intro, body, and conclusion. Big yawn.

Can you intro yourself, tell ‚Äòem what you‚Äôll cover, and do your framing in 60 seconds?

We‚Äôll also make sure your body looks beautiful too (no not that one silly‚Ä¶your presentation body).

And, you‚Äôll be able to close like a champ too.

I‚Äôm essentially giving you a formula you can use for the rest of your life.

Analytics Managers who are leading a team of analysts
Business Analysts who want to understand Text Mining Techniques
'Python' professionals who want to design automatic predictive models on text data 
""This is apt for everyone‚Äù

---------------------------------


Why Learn Natural Language Processing or NLP?

Natural Language Processing (or Text Analytics/Text Mining) applies analytic tools to learn from collections of text data, like social media, books, newspapers, emails, etc. The goal can be considered to be similar to humans learning by reading such material. However, using automated algorithms we can learn from massive amounts of text, very much more than a human can. It is bringing a new revolution by giving rise to chatbots and virtual assistants to help one system address queries of millions of users.

NLP is a branch of artificial intelligence that has many important implications on the ways that computers and humans interact. Human language, developed over thousands and thousands of years, has become a nuanced form of communication that carries a wealth of information that often transcends the words alone. NLP will become an important technology in bridging the gap between human communication and digital data.

Why Learn Deep Learning With TensorFlow?
TensorFlow is one of the best libraries to implement Deep Learning. TensorFlow is a software library for numerical computation of mathematical expressions, using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that flow between them. It was created by Google and tailored for Machine Learning. In fact, it is being widely used to develop solutions with Deep Learning. 

Machine learning is one of the fastest-growing and most exciting fields out there, and Deep Learning represents its true bleeding edge. Deep learning is primarily a study of multi-layered neural networks, spanning over a vast range of model architectures. Traditional neural networks relied on shallow nets, composed of one input, one hidden layer and one output layer. Deep-learning networks are distinguished from these ordinary neural networks having more hidden layers, or so-called more depth. These kinds of nets are capable of discovering hidden structures within unlabeled and unstructured data (i.e. images, sound, and text), which constitutes the vast majority of data in the world.

LECTURE Part A: http://bit.ly/pDL-en-12-1
In this section we discuss the various architectures used in NLP applications, beginning with CNNs, RNNs, and eventually covering the state of-the art architecture, transformers. We then discuss the various modules that comprise transformers and how they make transformers advantageous for NLP tasks. Finally, we discuss tricks that allow transformers to be trained effectively.

LECTURE Part B: http://bit.ly/pDL-en-12-2
In this section we introduce beam search as a middle ground between greedy decoding and exhaustive search. We consider the case of wanting to sample from the generative distribution (i.e. when generating text) and introduce ‚Äútop-k‚Äù sampling. Subsequently, we introduce sequence to sequence models (with a transformer variant) and back-translation. We then introduce unsupervised learning approaches for learning embeddings and discuss word2vec, GPT, and BERT.

#MachineLearningWithR #MachineLearningFullCourse #MachineLearningTutorial #MachineLearning #SimplilearnMachineLearning #MachineLearningCourse

Machine learning is a core sub-area of artificial intelligence; it enables computers to get into a mode of self-learning without being explicitly programmed. When exposed to new data, these computer programs are enabled to learn, grow, change, and develop by themselves. So, put simply, the iterative aspect of machine learning is the ability to adapt to new data independently. This is possible as programs learn from previous computations and use ‚Äúpattern recognition‚Äù to produce reliable results. 

R is a widely popular programming language in the field of machine learning. R is an open-source programming language used for statistical computing. It is one of the most popular programming languages today. R was inspired by S+, which is similar to the S programming language. R has various data structures and operators. It can be integrated with other programming languages like C, C++, Java, and Python.

In this video, you'll learn about simple linear regressions of time series.

A simple linear regression finds the slope, beta, and intercept, alpha, of a line that's the best fit between a dependent variable, y, and an independent variable, x. The x's and y's can be a two-time series.

A linear regression is also known as Ordinary Least Squares, or OLS, because it minimizes the sum of the squared distances between the data points and the regression line.

Regression techniques are very common, and therefore there are many packages in Python that can be used. In statsmodels, there is OLS. In numpy, there is polyfit, and if you set degree equals 1, it fits the data to a line, which is a linear regression. Pandas has an ols method, and scipy has a linear regression function. Beware that the order of x and y is not consistent across packages.
All these packages are very similar, and in this course, you will use the statsmodels OLS.

Now you'll regress the returns of the small cap stocks on the returns of large cap stocks. Compute returns from prices using the ""pct_change"" method in pandas. You need to add a column of ones as a dependent, right-hand side variable. The reason you have to do this is because the regression function assumes that if there is no constant column, then you want to run the regression without an intercept. By adding a column of ones, statsmodels will compute the regression coefficient of that column as well, which can be interpreted as the intercept of the line. The statsmodels method ""add constant"" is a simple way to add a constant.

Notice that the first row of the return series is NaN. Each return is computed from two prices, so there is one less return than price. To delete the first row of NaN's, use the pandas method ""dropna"". You're finally ready to run the regression. The first argument of the statsmodel regression is the series that represents the dependent variable, y, and the next argument contains the independent variable or variables. In this case, the dependent variable is the R2000 returns and the independent variables are the constant and SPX returns. The method ""fit"" runs the regression and results are saved in a class instance called results.

The summary method of results shows the entire regression output. We will only focus on a few items of the regression results. In the red box, the coefficent 1-point-1412 is the slope of the regression, which is also referred to as beta. The coefficient above that is the intercept, which is very close to zero. You can also pull out individual items from results, like the intercept, in results-dot-params zero, and the slope, in results-dot-params one.

Another statistic to take note of is the R-Squared of 0-point-753. That will be discussed next.

From the scatter diagrams, you saw that the correlation measures how closely the data are clustered along a line. The R-squared also measures how well the linear regression line fits the data. So as you would expect, there is a relationship between correlation and R-squared. The magnitude of the correlation is the square root of the R-squared. And the sign of the correlation is the sign of the slope of the regression line. If the regression line is positively sloped, the correlation is positive and if the regression line is negatively sloped, the correlation is negative. In the example you just analyzed, of large cap and small cap stocks, the R-Squared was 0-point-753, the slope of the regression was positive, so the correlation is then positive the square root of 0-point-753, or 0-point-868, which can be verified by computing the correlation directly.

In this video, I explain why for 99% of projects, you are probably better off with an SQL database. The need for sharded  (sharding) databases, and horizontal scaling (one of the mentioned key advantages of noSQL databases) is exceptionally rare.

If you're looking for a complete SQL tutorial for beginners with examples, this tutorial is a great way to learn SQL basics. Just follow through and you'll be able to write SQL queries in no time. 

SQL, short for Structured Query Language, is a language used by software developers, data scientists and anyone who works with data. With SQL, you can store data in relational databases and write queries to extract valuable information. 

There are various database management systems (DBMS) that support SQL but each product has its own implementation of SQL. In this course, we'll be using MySQL to learn SQL. MySQL is the most popular free and open-source database management system in the world. If you use a different DBMS (eg SQL Server), you can still benefit from this course as 90% of the skills you'll learn in this course can be transferred to other database management systems.",Blogging; Database Management System; Facebook; Free Hand; Information Threat; Links; MySQL; Relational Database; Router; Structured Query Language (SQL); Syntax; Table; Twitter; Windows; jQuery

Selection of features is necessary to create a functional model so as to achieve a reduction in cardinality, imposing a limit greater than the number of features that must be considered during its creation. Feature selection is based on finding a subset of the original variables, usually iteratively, thus detecting new combinations of variables and comparing prediction errors.

In this lecture, we start to lay down some of our basic language for talking about networks that comes to us from graph theory a relatively new area of mathematics that studies the properties of graphs.



Transcription:

When we hear the word network all sorts of things spring to mind like social networks and the Internet in particular, but the power of network theory is really in its high degree of abstraction, so the first thing for us to do is to try and start back at the beginning by forgetting what we think we know about networks and embrace the abstract language of networks what is called graph theory. In the formal language of mathematics a network is called a graph and graph theory is the area of mathematics that studies these objects called graphs. The first theory of graphs goes back to 1736, the first textbook came about in 1958 but most of the work within this field is less than a few decades old.
In its essence a graph is really very simple, it consist of just two parts what are called vertices and edges. Firstly Vertices; a vertex or node is a thing, that is to say it is an entity and we can ascribe some value to it, so a person is an example of a node as is a car, planet, farm, city or molecule. All of these things have static properties that can be quantifies, such as the color of our car, the size of our farm, or the weight of our molecule. Within network science vertices are more often called nodes so we will be typically using this term during the course.
Edges can be define as a relation of some sort between two or more nodes, this connection may be tangible as in the cables between computers on a network or the roads between cities within a national transportation system or these edges may by be intangible, such as social relations of friendship. Edges may be also called links, ties or relations and we will be often using this latter term during the course. The nodes belonging to an edge are called the ends, endpoints, or end vertices of the edge.
Within graph theory networks are called graphs and a graph is define as a set of edges and a set vertices. A simple graph does not contain loops or multiple edges, but a multigraph is a graph with multiple edges between nodes. So where as a simple graph of a transpiration system would just tell us if there is a connection between two cities, a multigraph would show all the different connections between the two cities.
Graphs can be directed or undirected. With an undirected graph edges have no orientation, for example a diplomatic relation between two nations may be mutual and thus have no direction to the edge between the nodes. These undirected graphs have unordered pairs of nodes, that means we can just switch them round, if Jane and Paul are married, we can say Jane is married to Paul or we can say Paul is married to Jane it makes no difference and thus it is an unordered pair.

Finding structure in unstructured data automatically sounds like a dream come true, no need to have a label! In this video, I'll demonstrate 2 types of unsupervised learning techniques; k means clustering and principal component analysis. We'll use these techniques on neural data from a patient suffering from seizures to see if we can locate the part of their brain in need of surgery to save their life. You'll laugh, you'll cry, but most importantly, you'll learn. Enjoy!

Computer vision uses images and video to detect, classify, and track objects or events in order to understand a real-world scene. In this webinar, we dive deeper into the topic of object detection and tracking. Through product demonstrations, you will see how to:

Recognize objects using SURF features
Detect faces and upright people with algorithms such as Viola-Jones
Track single objects with the Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (KLT) point tracking algorithm
Perform Kalman Filtering to predict the location of a moving object
Implement a motion-based multiple object tracking system
This webinar assumes some experience with MATLAB and Image Processing Toolbox. We will focus on the Computer Vision System Toolbox.

A/B testing is the process of testing two web elements to find out which performs better.

Let‚Äôs say a web banner gets a CTR of 1%.

Now, if you want to improve the CTR to 2%, you need a better banner. But how can you find out if a new banner performs better?

You have use a A/B testing tool which will automatically rotate the two variations of the banners on your web page.

If your web page gets 1,000 visitors, the a/b testing tool will display the banner A for 500 times and Banner B for 500 times.

If Banner A gets a 1% CTR and Banner B gets a 1.5% CTR, you have found out which variation of the banner performs better!

You can run another A/B testing experiment with a new design and try to improve the CTR even more.

There is no limit to how many experiments you can run!

And A/B testing is not limited to banners.

A/B testing can be carried out with call-to-action buttons, landing pages, email subject lines, logos or any other communication element you can think of!

Stanford University

I'll describe a novel statistical methodology that has been deployed by the commercial A/B testing platform Optimizely to communicate experimental results to their customers. Our methodology addresses the issue that traditional p-values and confidence intervals give unreliable inference. This is because users of A/B testing software are known to continuously monitor these measures as the experiment is running. We provide always valid p-values and confidence intervals that are provably robust to this effect. Not only does this make it safe for a user to continuously monitor, but it empowers her to detect true effects more efficiently. I'll cover why continuous monitoring is a problem, and how our solution addresses it.

The talk will be presented at a level that does not presume much statistical background.

Ramesh Johari is an Associate Professor at Stanford University, with a full-time appointment in the Department of Management Science and Engineering (MS&E), and courtesy appointments in the Departments of Computer Science (CS) and Electrical Engineering (EE). He is a member of the Operations Research group and the Social Algorithms Lab (SOAL) in MS&E, the Information Systems Laboratory (ISL) in EE, and the Institute for Computational and Mathematical Engineering (ICME).

AYfVTRtPg30,5 Super Cool Computer Vision Applications Using Deep Learning,Smitha Kolan - Machine Learning Engineer,https://youtube.com/watch?v=AYfVTRtPg30,2019-09-28T01:14:09Z,In today's video I'm going to be talking about 5 really cool computer vision applications that can be implemented using deep learning. Computer vision is an area ...,20.0,Computer Vision,"In today‚Äôs video I‚Äôm going to be talking about 5 really cool computer vision applications that can be implemented using deep learning.

Computer vision is an area in computer science which focuses on enabling computers to see, identify and process images in the same way that humans do.

Deep learning is a machine learning technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to us humans: learning by example. In deep learning, a computer mode is trained by using a large set of labeled data and neural network architectures that contain many layers.

5. Image Classification:

Image classification is the MOST popular use of computer vision. It is the process of identifying objects in images. For Human beings when we see a picture, we know automatically what it is. Its not that simple for a computer. And this problem gets harder to solve when we are working with huge data. Image classification is used in the auto industry(in self driving cars) and healthcare(for instance identifying tumors from endoscopies & biopsies). 


4. Image Colorization:

Image Colorization does exactly what it says; it adds color to B&W images. However achieving the real color of an image is extremely difficult, and here is why. When we have a grey scale image, we essentially only have one kind of information of each of the pixels; their intensity. So how do we determine the RGB value of each of the pixels? Turns out each pixels has 313 different classes(Colours). So the problem with image classification is that each grey pixel has 313 color possibilities to choose from.

3. 3D Reconstruction:

For a human, it is usually an easy task to get an idea of the 3D structure shown in an image. Due to the loss of one dimension in the projection process, the estimation of the true 3D geometry is difficult and a so called ill-posed problem, because usually infinitely many different 3D surfaces may produce the same set of images.

2. Image Synthesis:

Image synthesis is an extremely broad genre. Most forms of image synthesis use what‚Äôs called a Generative Adversial Network(AKA GAN) and it is a type of neural network for generating models. GANs generate images that are similar to an existing image but not exactly the same. For instance, it can be used to generate human faces.

1. Image Style Transfer:

Is a technique using 2 images(‚Äúcontent‚Äù & ‚Äústyle reference‚Äù) and blending them together so the output image looks like the content image but painted on like the style reference image. It can be used in Art, In computer graphics, media and many more.

In general, R is most useful in medical and research fields. R is good for building interactive visuals (R Shiny), and may have some modules that are superior to those in Python.

On the other hand. Python has better documentation and is more flexible as a programming language. 

You may not have to learn R at all if you know python. You can see the below reference guides that show you how to translate python code to R and vice versa. There are also some modules that allow you to use python directly in the R kernel.

In this tutorial you will go from having zero knowledge to writing an artificial intelligence that can compose Shakespearean prose.

No prior experience with deep learning is required, though it is always helpful to have more background information. We‚Äôll use a combination of embedding layers, recurrent neural networks, and fully connected layers to perform the classification.

‚å®Ô∏è (33:25) How to Perform Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews 
‚å®Ô∏è (59:32) Let‚Äôs Write An AI That Writes Shakespeare 


‚≠êÔ∏èCourse Description ‚≠êÔ∏è
The basic idea behind natural language processing is that we start out with words, i.e. strings of characters, that are almost impossible for the computer to meaningfully parse. We can transform these strings into a vector in a higher dimensional space. Different words will be represented as vectors of different lengths and directions in this space, and this allows us to find relationships between words by finding the component of one vector along another. Don‚Äôt worry, the TensorFlow library handles all of this, we just have to have some basic idea of how it works.

Since this is a type of supervised learning, we also have labels for our text. This allows the AI to compare the relationships between words to the training labels, and learn which sequences of words represent good and bad movie reviews. This would also work for finding toxic comments, fake product reviews‚Ä¶ just about anything for which we need a multiclass classification of text ‚Äì provided we have enough training data and labels.

The last step in complexity is to change the final layer that handles the classification. This allows us to actually output text that the AI thinks is meaningful. What‚Äôs really special about this is that the neural network starts out not even knowing that letters are a thing, or that we use spaces and punctuation, to producing something that approximates human level writing.

In this video, we discuss Time Series Analysis using Python in Hindi. A time series is a sequence of observations over a certain period. A univariate time series consists of the values taken by a single variable at periodic time instances over a period, and a multivariate time series consists of the values taken by multiple variables at the same periodic time instances over a period. The analysis of temporal data is capable of giving us useful insights on how a variable changes over time, or how it depends on the change in the values of other variables (s). This relationship of a variable on its previous values and/or other variables can be analyzed for time series forecasting and has numerous applications.

Phil Winder - Phil masters the hard art of backing theory by real-life experience. There is always more to learn about data and reinforcement learning

ABSTRACT
Reinforcement learning (RL), a sub-discipline of machine learning, has been gaining academic and media notoriety after hyped marketing ""reveals"" of agents playing various games. But these hide the fact that RL is immensely useful in many practical, industrial situations where hand-coding strategies or policies would be impractical or sub-optimal.
Following the theme of Phil's new book Reinforcement Learning, Phil will present a rebuttal to the hyperbole by analyzing five different industrial case studies from a variety of sectors.
You will learn where RL can be applied, how to spot challenges that fit inside the RL paradigm [...]

Also known as Machine intelligence, it is the ability of a computer or computer-controlled machine to perform tasks without external help from human intelligence. This term is usually tied with the systems which possess the intellect as good as humans and have the capability to reason, discover meanings, generalise or learn from past experiences. But a question arises here. How can such systems be developed? 

This is where machine learning comes into action. Machine Learning is a field of study which provides computers with the ability to learn something without the need for programming. In other words, it is an application of artificial intelligence which helps the system become capable of learning and improving automatically from experience instead of complete programming. 

But can any engineer regardless of the field learn and understand Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence? Let‚Äôs find it out!

PowerPoint is an enterprise level software and an amazing product of Microsoft Office. It has a great potential and the kind of features it provides are so easy to understand and simple to use that every student, manager, marketing executive or sales guy can easily create brilliant professional presentations. Microsoft Office PowerPoint is often underestimated but it allows us to create presentations, logos, banners, templates, designs, graphics, and most importantly video animations. 

A PowerPoint Presentation designed appropriately can really convince your target audience. A lot of design thinking needs to be put into a slide to make sure that the message is clearly delivered to the user.

I have created all the videos in PowerPoint included in Microsoft Office 365 suite. My idea is to help my audience learn the PowerPoint and get to know how easy it is to create anything in presentation.

Supervised learning is a type of Machine Learning which learns from the labelled data.

A data which has a particular label or value assigned to it, is a labelled data.

As we are already providing the right answer, we can say that the model is learning under our supervision. Thus we call it Supervised Learning.

There are two types of Supervised Learning :
1. Classification
2. Regression

My name is Tim Buchalka and I have put together a series of videos which I call the ""Programming Tip of the Day"". And basically, each video goes through talking about some of the pitfalls and things that you'll need to overcome to succeed as a programmer, things like overcoming frustration and keeping yourself motivated.

In this series I will also answer common questions about  choosing a programming language to learn, questions about your career path and things of that nature. Now there's a lot of other things as well that I'll cover in these videos and I'm also opening the lines for you to tell me what you want me to cover.

Now I've been a programmer for over 35 years so I think I'm real qualified to answer a lot of these questions. So if you do have a question, pop the question in the comments section of this video and I'll do my best to address that in a future video.

Machine learning¬†(ML) is the¬†scientific study¬†of¬†algorithms¬†and¬†statistical models¬†that¬†computer systems¬†use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and¬†inference¬†instead. It is seen as a subset of¬†artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a¬†mathematical model¬†based on sample data, known as ""training data"", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task.Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as¬†email filtering¬†and¬†computer vision, where it is difficult or infeasible to develop a conventional algorithm for effectively performing the task.
Machine learning is closely related to¬†computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers. The study of¬†mathematical optimization¬†delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning.¬†Data mining¬†is a field of study within machine learning, and focuses on¬†exploratory data analysis¬†through¬†unsupervised learning.¬†In its application across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as¬†predictive analytics.

When reviewing an annual report, you come across the word ‚Äúconsolidated‚Äù everywhere!
When browsing the financial statements: Consolidated Statement of Income. Consolidated Balance Sheet. Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. When reviewing the key metrics: Consolidated Net Sales. Consolidated Net Income. When reading the supplemental schedules: Consolidated Results of Operations. Consolidated Subsidiaries.

00:00 Introduction
00:33 Definition of consolidated financial statements
00:53 Examples of consolidated financial statements
01:49 Principles of consolidation
03:09 How to consolidate financial statements
03:42 Intercompany sales elimination
07:38 Intercompany ownership
09:09 Consolidation information in the annual report
09:42 Consolidation summary

Let‚Äôs start off with a definition of consolidated financial statements: the financial statements of a group in which the assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows of the parent and its subsidiaries are presented as those of a single economic entity. Let‚Äôs illustrate that definition with some examples. 

When you review the consolidated statements of income of Walmart Inc, you are looking at the economic entity of the Walmart group, consisting of the parent company Walmart Inc and a list of consolidated legal entities. 

When you review the consolidated balance sheets of Apple Inc, you are looking at the economic entity of the Apple group, consisting of the parent company Apple Inc and a list of consolidated legal entities. 

When you review the consolidated statements of cash flows of Tesla Inc, you are looking at the economic entity of the Tesla group, consisting of the parent company Tesla Inc and seven pages‚Äô worth of consolidated legal entities. 

The big question here is: to consolidate or not to consolidate? Or more specifically: who to consolidate, and how to consolidate? 

There is plenty of documentation on the subject of consolidation, that outlines the requirements for the preparation and presentation of consolidated financial statements. For US GAAP, ASC 810. For IFRS, IFRS 10. Let‚Äôs discuss the highlights. 

Who to consolidate? The core concept here is ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù. Does the parent company have the power to direct activities of the subsidiary? Does the parent have exposure, or rights, to variable returns of the subsidiary? In other words, the obligation to absorb losses from, or right to receive benefits from, with returns that must vary and can be positive, negative, or both. Usually, there is control when ownership and voting rights exceed 50%. However, in certain unusual circumstances, control may exist with less than 50 percent ownership, when contractually supported. This concept is referred to as effective control. If control of a subsidiary is not established, then the investing company still needs to account for the investment, through methods other than consolidation, for example using the equity method of accounting, but that‚Äôs for a different video to discuss.

Let‚Äôs continue on the path of consolidation. After determining who to consolidate, the next question is how to consolidate. To a large extent, it is all one big summation. To prepare consolidated financial statements, combine like items of assets, liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows of the parent with those of its subsidiaries. In addition, there may be the need to eliminate intercompany transactions and intercompany ownership or financing positions. Here are two common examples that are discussed in detail in this video: intercompany sales between entities within the group, and intercompany ownership. 

So where do you find information about consolidation in an annual report? Go to the notes to the consolidated financial statements, section ‚Äúprinciples of consolidation‚Äù, and you will find both the ‚Äúwho‚Äù and the ‚Äúhow‚Äù of consolidation. For example, Walmart states that it consolidates variable interest entities where it has been determined that the Company is the primary beneficiary of those entities' operations, and that intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

In this full tutorial course, you will get a solid foundation in reinforcement learning core topics.

The course covers Q learning, SARSA, double Q learning, deep Q learning, and policy gradient methods. These algorithms are employed in a number of environments from the open AI gym, including space invaders, breakout, and others. The deep learning portion uses Tensorflow and PyTorch.

The course begins with more modern algorithms, such as deep q learning and policy gradient methods, and demonstrates the power of reinforcement learning.

Then the course teaches some of the fundamental concepts that power all reinforcement learning algorithms. These are illustrated by coding up some algorithms that predate deep learning, but are still foundational to the cutting edge. These are studied in some of the more traditional environments from the OpenAI gym, like the cart pole problem.

Relationship between DBMS & Application Program

There is a very close relationship between DBMS and application program 
The application program provides the user interface
The user uses this interface to perform  different operations on database via DBMS.
The user sends requests to DBMS
DBMS receive these request.
It processes the requests and returns the results to the application program
The user receive the results through application program
DBMS retrieves data from database or performs other different operations on database according to the requests sent by user.

What is Supervised Machine Learning?

In Supervised learning, you train the machine using data that is well ""labeled."" It means some data is already tagged with the correct answer. It can be compared to learning which takes place in the presence of a supervisor or a teacher.

A supervised learning algorithm learns from labeled training data, helps you to predict outcomes for unforeseen data. Successfully building, scaling, and deploying accurate supervised machine learning Data science model takes time and technical expertise from a team of highly skilled data scientists. Moreover, Data scientist must rebuild models to make sure the insights given remains true until its data changes.

2. What is Unsupervised Learning?

Unsupervised learning is a machine learning technique, where you do not need to supervise the model. Instead, you need to allow the model to work on its own to discover information. It mainly deals with the unlabelled data. Unsupervised learning algorithms allow you to perform more complex processing tasks compared to supervised learning. Although, unsupervised learning can be more unpredictable compared with other natural learning deep learning and reinforcement learning methods.

Why Learn Hadoop?

Big Data! A Worldwide Problem?

According to Wikipedia, ""Big data is collection of data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional data processing applications."" In simpler terms, Big Data is a term given to large volumes of data that organizations store and process. However, it is becoming very difficult for companies to store, retrieve and process the ever-increasing data. If any company gets hold on managing its data well, nothing can stop it from becoming the next BIG success!

The problem lies in the use of traditional systems to store enormous data. Though these systems were a success a few years ago, with increasing amount and complexity of data, these are soon becoming obsolete. The good news is - Hadoop has become an integral part for storing, handling, evaluating and retrieving hundreds of terabytes, and even petabytes of data.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

Opportunities for Hadoopers!

Opportunities for Hadoopers are infinite - from a Hadoop Developer, to a Hadoop Tester or a Hadoop Architect, and so on. If cracking and managing BIG Data is your passion in life, then think no more and Join Edureka's Hadoop Online course and carve a niche for yourself!

In the previous video, you learned about three machine learning techniques: Classification, Regression and Clustering. As you might have felt, there are quite some similarities between Classification and Regression. For both, you try to find a function, or a model, which can later be used to predict labels or values for unseen observations. It is important that during the training of the function, labeled observations are available to the algorithm. We call these techniques supervised learning.

Labeling can be a tedious work and is often done by puny humans. There are other techniques which don't require labeled observations to learn from data. These techniques are called unsupervised learning. You've already acquainted yourself with one of these techniques in the previous video, namely Clustering. Clustering will find groups of observations that are similar, and thus does not require specific labeled observations. 

In the next chapter we'll talk about assessing the performance of your trained model. In supervised learning, we can use the real labels of the observations and compare them with the labels we predicted. It's quite straightforward that you want your model's predictions to be as similar as possible to the real labels. With unsupervised learning, however, measuring the performance gets more difficult: we don't have real labels to compare anything to. You'll learn some neat techniques to assess the quality of a clustering in the next chapter.

As you get more experienced as a data scientist, you might notice that things aren't always black and white. In machine learning, some techniques overlap between supervised and unsupervised learning. With semi-supervised learning, for example, you can have alot of observations which are not labeled, and a few which are. You can then first perform clustering to group all observations which are similar. Afterwards, you can use information about the clusters and about the few labeled observations to assign a class to unlabeled observations. This will give you more labeled observations to perform supervised learning on.

Enough talking, let's do some more exercises!",Algorithm; Azure Machine Learning; Classification and Regression Tree; Clustering; R; Regression; Semi-supervised Learning; Supervised Learning; Training; Unsupervised Learning; Video

It is divided into three sections - 

1) Challenges of Deep Learning (continuation of previous lecture)

2) Designing the Architecture - https://youtu.be/HSDyiCuViWg?t=371

3) Writing the code in Matlab (Implementation) - https://youtu.be/HSDyiCuViWg?t=678 

You can copy the code from here - https://www.nzfaruqui.com/deep-learning-using-matlab/

In the first section, the challenges of Deep Learning have been explained briefly. In the second section, the architecture of neural network has been explained. It also covered selection criteria of input nodes and output nodes, weight matrices and training data. In the third section, the implementation has been demonstrated.

In the previous lecture, we have learned details about Neural Network. That is why I didn't recap those things and directly started with the challenges of deep neural network.

Almost every new learners find it difficult to understand few things such as - how to select number of input nodes, number of output nodes, weight matrices, who data are passed into the network, how to calculate error and so on. I have explained these concept using animations and graphics.

Third section, the final section is the implementation part. Here I have implemented the concept I explained in the lecture. First I coded 'DeepLearning' function. The necessary functions  - ReLU and Softmax function have been implemented as well. Then I have shown how to train a deep neural network by calling the 'DeepLearning' function. Finally I have tested the deep neural network. All of these has been shown in Matlab code.

I hope this lesson will help you to understand how to train a deep neural network in Matlab. And after completing this lecture, you will be able to train your own deep neural network to accomplish what ever you want.",Animation; Architecture; Deep Learning; MATLAB; Neural Network; Selection; Training; Writing

At the end of the day, the value of Data Scientists rests on their ability to describe the world and to make predictions. Machine Learning is the field of teaching machines and computers to learn from existing data to make predictions on new data - will a given tumor be benign or malignant? Which of your customers will take their business elsewhere? Is a particular email spam or not? In this course, you'll learn how to use Python to perform supervised learning, an essential component of Machine Learning. You'll learn how to build predictive models, how to tune their parameters and how to tell how well they will perform on unseen data, all the while using real world datasets. You'll do so using scikit-learn, one of the most popular and user-friendly machine learning libraries for Python.",Dataset; Email; Machine Learning; Predictive Model; Python; Scikit-learn; Supervised Learning; Unsupervised Learning; Video

ABOUT THE TALK

Bayesian tools for statistical analysis have made huge leaps forward in the past years, and are on their way to becoming an industry standard. On the other hand, as machine learning tools become more and more prevalent, many issues have come to light: dealing properly with uncertainty, understanding causality, the concept of ""statistical significance"", etc. In this talk I'll walk you through a basic A/B testing use case and demonstrate the strength challenges of Bayesian tools in dealing with these issues.

ABOUT THE SPEAKER

Yizhar (Izzy) Toren (M.Sc) is a Bayesian by belief, but a frequentist and ML data scientist engineer by trade. He graduated from Tel Aviv University's (TAU) interdisciplinary program with a Master's degree in Mathematics, worked in multiple industries (bio-tech, gaming, financial services, retail, etc.) and has more than 15 years of experience as a data scientist, consultant and ""plain old"" statistician.

Artificial Intelligence is definitely the next big thing. However, programmers still find it hard to understand what A.I. really is and how they can use that bring their programming career to the next level.

AI is a broad topic ranging from simple calculators to self-steering technology to something that might radically change the future.

The primary goals of A.I. include deduction and reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, natural language processing (NLP), learning, perception, and the ability to manipulate and move objects. Long-term goals of AI research include achieving Creativity, Social Intelligence, and General (human level) Intelligence.

AI has heavily influenced different sectors that we may not recognize. Ray Kurzweil says ‚ÄúMany thousands of AI applications are deeply embedded in the infrastructure of every industry.‚Äù John McCarthy, one of the founders of AI, once said that ‚Äúas soon as it works, no one calls it AI anymore.‚Äù
(Source: https://www.hackerearth.com/blog/developers/artificial-intelligence-101-how-to-get-started/)

But... Where to start learning A.I.? How you, as a programmer, can incorporate A.I. opportunities in your career?

Is there a better programming language to learn artificial intelligence? Is there a specific technology you should learn?

This online seminar will provide a general overview regarding Machine Learning and an introduction to Unsupervised Learning, playing with the MATLAB built-in function.
Contents of the seminar are mainly taken from the online self-paced course Machine Learning with MATLAB, with extra contents to understand/review the theoretical background. 

Event date.
- 29th of April, 2020

We are going to discuss two subgroups of analysis, belonging to unsupervised learning, which are Dimensionality Reduction and Cluster Analysis. Specifically, after a basic introduction of few core concepts, we are going to discuss how some unsupervised learning algorithms work, like PCA, Multidimensional Scaling, k-means, and others. The seminar will also provide Demos to recap these concepts and apply them to solve problems.
The presentation lasts 2 h and it is intended to be for beginners in the field. However, I added few extra contents, expecially in the demo, hoping that this presentation would be interesting also for those already familiar with these topics.

#MachineLearningWithPython #MachineLearningTypes #MachineLearning #MachineLearningTutorial #MachineLearningCourse #MachineLearningAlgorithms #Simplilearn

What Exactly is Machine Learning?
A good start at a Machine Learning definition is that it is a core sub-area of Artificial Intelligence (AI). ML applications learn from experience (well data) like humans without direct programming. When exposed to new data, these applications learn, grow, change, and develop by themselves. 

What is Supervised Learning?
In supervised learning, we use known or labeled data for the training data. Since the data is known, the learning is, therefore, supervised, i.e., directed into successful execution. The input data goes through the Machine Learning algorithm and is used to train the model. 

What is Unsupervised Learning?
In unsupervised learning, the training data is unknown and unlabeled - meaning that no one has looked at the data before. Without the aspect of known data, the input cannot be guided to the algorithm, which is where the unsupervised term originates from. This data is fed to the Machine Learning algorithm and is used to train the model. The trained model tries to search for a pattern and give the desired response. 

What is Reinforcement Learning?
Like traditional types of data analysis, here, the algorithm discovers data through a process of trial and error and then decides what action results in higher rewards. Three major components make up reinforcement learning: the agent, the environment, and the actions. The agent is the learner or decision-maker, the environment includes everything that the agent interacts with, and the actions are what the agent does.

‚úÖWhat is C++ Programming? 
C++ is an enhanced and extended version of C programming language, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 as part of his PhD project. Bjarne developed what he called ‚ÄòC with Classes‚Äô (later renamed C++) because he felt limited by the existing programming languages that were not ideal for large scale projects. He used C to build what he wanted because C was already a general-purpose language that was efficient and fast in its operations.

‚úÖC++ Career Prospects:
With just C++ programming expertise, you will have excellent job opportunities, salaries, and career prospects. However, for a career based on programming languages such as Java and Python (which are in more demand than C++) or for careers based on front-end, back-end, and full-stack development, you will go a lot further with C++ expertise. Furthermore, in development domains such as software testing, you are expected to know C++.

We first answer the important question of why someone should even care about studying graph theory through an application perspective. Afterwards, we introduce definitions and essential terminology in graph theory, followed by a discussion of the types of graphs you may encounter. We then define several ways to represent graphs as a data structure and finish off the video with a discussion of what types of interesting problems you can ask about graphs to help motivate the ideas in future videos. 

Typo correction: at 5:12 the vertex set V should be {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} instead of {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} (there is no vertex 5).

Machine Learning is one of the most effectively used technology. Currently, all the companies are using this technology as they can use their data to understand the important areas from where they can grow their business. Understanding all of this, we have come up with this tutorial on ""Unsupervised Learning"" which is a very important clustering algorithm.

As we all know that Supervised machine learning is a method in which models are trained using labeled data under the supervision of training data. But there may be many cases in which we do not have labeled data and need to find the hidden patterns from the given dataset. So, to solve such types of cases in machine learning, we need unsupervised learning techniques. Unsupervised learning cannot be directly applied to a regression or classification problem because unlike supervised learning, we have the input data but no corresponding output data 

Unsupervised learning is a machine learning technique in which models are not supervised using a training dataset. Instead, the models itself find the hidden patterns and insights from the given data. It can be compared to learning which takes place in the human brain while learning new things. The goal of unsupervised learning is to find the underlying structure of the dataset, group that data according to similarities, and represent that dataset in a compressed format. In this tutorial, we will help you to cover every concept related to Unsupervised Learning.

In this video I go over my favorite resources for learning R.    I always recommend picking one of R or Python and mastering it - so ok, suppose you want to learn R, HOW exactly do you go about doing that?    There's a lot of paid courses out there, but unless you really want that certification, there are so many free resources that you don't need that.

‚úÖWhat is C++ Programming? 
C++ is an enhanced and extended version of C programming language, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 as part of his Ph.D. project. Bjarne developed what he called ‚ÄòC with Classes‚Äô (later renamed C++) because he felt limited by the existing programming languages that were not ideal for large scale projects. He used C to build what he wanted because C was already a general-purpose language that was efficient and fast in its operations.

‚úÖC++ Career Prospects:
With just C++ programming expertise, you will have excellent job opportunities, salaries, and career prospects. However, for a career based on programming languages such as Java and Python (which are in more demand than C++) or for careers based on front-end, back-end, and full-stack development, you will go a lot further with C++ expertise. Furthermore, in development domains such as software testing, you are expected to know C++.

Data Preprocessing is an important factor in deciding the accuracy of your Machine Learning model. 

In this tutorial, we learn why Feature Selection , Feature Extraction, Dimentionality Reduction are important. We also learn about the famous methods which can be used for the purpose.

Data Preprocessing is a very important step in Data Analytics which is ignored by many. To make your models accurate you have to ensure proper preprocessing as the Machine Learning model is highly dependent on data.

What is Linear Regression Analysis?
Machine Learning is an application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that provides systems with the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Linear regression is a statistical model used to predict the relationship between independent and dependent variables by examining two factors:
Which variables, in particular, are significant predictors of the outcome variable?
How significant is the regression line in terms of making predictions with the highest possible accuracy?

You might wonder, what is R, and why you should learn R programming?
Well, R is a popular programming language adopted for data science and statistics, and The R programming language is used by professionals and data experts around the world for mapping marketing trends, modelling financial data, and so on.

And the best thing is, R programming language is free. R is an open-source statistical programming language supported by a community. R is also called the language for statistical computing. 

R runs on almost any computing platform and operating system. 
R provides a rich collection of statistical techniques or functions and has sophisticated graphical and visualization capabilities for plots and graphs. This language also provides a complex and sophisticated visualization of high-dimensional data. Another very important feature of R is that it is highly extensible. 

R language is not strictly in the sense only for statistics but also for advance mathematical modelling and machine learning.  This introduction to R course is the best way to start learning R programming and getting handy with its features. 

In this course, we will cover the R‚Äôs basics and programming fundamentals. Eventually, you will learn how to use R‚Äôs data structures such as Vectors, Matrices, Lists and Data frames. 

Each of these sections includes a screencast of hands-on implementation and is also accompanied by short quizzes. Finally, we will look at how to import data from various sources, and how to handle data large data. 

And on top of that in this course, we will move deeper into the graphical capabilities of R and learn how to create visualizations which will help in analysis.

In the end, we will perform basic statistical analysis on specifically designed stock price datasets to get the real feel of R‚Äôs statistical computing capabilities.

Lecture 10 is a brief introduction to geometric deep learning: an exciting research field intersecting graph theory and and deep learning.

In this lecture, I cover the three fundamental rules driving the field of deep learning including:
1) Locality: ‚Äútell me who your neighbours are, I will tell you who you are‚Äù,
2) Aggregation: ‚Äúhow to integrate information or messages you get from your neighbour?‚Äù, and
3) Composition: ‚Äúhow deep you want to learn from your neighbours‚Äô messages?‚Äù

Join DataCamp today, and start our interactive intro to R programming tutorial for free: https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r
So, what is a matrix. Well, a matrix is kind of like the big brother of the vector. Where a vector is a _sequence_ of data elements, which is one-dimensional, a matrix is a similar collection of data elements, but this time arranged into a fixed number of rows and columns. Since you are only working with rows and columns, a matrix is called two-dimensional. As with the vector, the matrix can contain only one atomic vector type. This means that you can't have logicals and numerics in a matrix for example. There's really not much more theory about matrices than this: it's really a natural extension of the vector, going from one to two dimensions. Of course, this has its implications for manipulating and subsetting matrices, but let's start with simply creating and naming them.

To build a matrix, you use the matrix function. Most importantly, it needs a vector, containing the values you want to place in the matrix, and at least one matrix dimension. You can choose to specify the number of rows or the number of columns. Have a look at the following example, that creates a 2-by-3 matrix containing the values 1 to 6, by specifying the vector and setting the nrow argument to 2:

R sees that the input vector has length 6 and that there have to be two rows. It then infers that you'll probably want 3 columns, such that the number of matrix elements matches the number of input vector elements. You could just as well specify ncol instead of nrow; in this case, R infers the number of _rows_ automatically.

In both these examples, R takes the vector containing the values 1 to 6, and fills it up, column by column. If you prefer to fill up the matrix in a row-wise fashion, such that the 1, 2 and 3 are in the first row, you can set the `byrow` argument of matrix to `TRUE`

Can you spot the difference?
Remember how R did recycling when you were subsetting vectors using logical vectors? The same thing happens when you pass the matrix function a vector that is too short to fill up the entire matrix. Suppose you pass a vector containing the values 1 to 3 to the matrix function, and explicitly say you want a matrix with 2 rows and 3 columns:

R fills up the matrix column by column and simply repeats the vector. If you try to fill up the matrix with a vector whose multiple does not nicely fit in the matrix, for example when you want to put a 4-element vector in a 6-element matrix, R generates a warning message. 

Actually, apart from the `matrix()` function, there's yet another easy way to create matrices that is more intuitive in some cases. You can paste vectors together using the `cbind()` and `rbind()` functions. Have a look at these calls

`cbind()`, short for column bind, takes the vectors you pass it, and sticks them together as if they were columns of a matrix. The `rbind()` function, short for row bind, does the same thing but takes the input as rows and makes a matrix out of them. These functions can come in pretty handy, because they're often more easy to use than the `matrix()` function.

The `bind` functions I just introduced can also handle matrices actually, so you can easily use them to paste another row or another column to an already existing matrix. Suppose you have a matrix `m`, containing the elements 1 to 6:

If you want to add another row to it, containing the values 7, 8, 9, you could simply run this command:

You can do a similar thing with `cbind()`:

Next up is naming the matrix. In the case of vectors, you simply used the names() function, but in the case of matrices, you could assign names to both columns and rows. That's why R came up with the rownames() and colnames() functions. Their use is pretty straightforward. Retaking the matrix `m` from before,

we can set the row names just the same way as we named vectors, but this time with the rownames function.

Printing m shows that it worked:

Setting the column names with a vector of length 3 gives us a fully named matrix

Just as with vectors, there are also one-liner ways of naming matrices while you're building it. You use the dimnames argument of the matrix function for this. Check this out.",Linker; R; Rally

To create the Harmonizone, we extract, abstract, and organize data into ~100 million functional associations between human genes and their attributes. Such attributes can be physical interactions with other biomolecules, expression in cell lines and tissues, genetic associations with human phenotypes, or changes in expression after drug treatment. We store these associations in a relational database along with rich metadata for the genes, their attributes, and the original resources. The freely available Harmonizome web portal provides a graphical user interface, a web service, and a mobile app for querying, browsing, and downloading all of the collected data. Since its publication in 2016 the Harmonizome resource has been accessed by ~600,000 unique users. Here, we introduce the Harmonizome Extract, Transform, & Load (ETL) Suite ‚Äì a series of Appyters that contain pipelines to convert omics resources into a format that is compatible with the Harmonizome‚Äôs data model. The Appyters are web apps that allow the loading of files from online biomedical resources. After uploading these files, the Appyters filter, normalize, and standardize the raw data to create the Harmonizome-compatible output. Data analysis and visualization is performed on the harmonized data. Using these Appyters several Harmonizome datasets were updated. Overall, the update features over 60 million statistically significant associations between genes and their attributes, increasing the information that is mined within the Harmonizome. The Harmonizome ETL Appyter Suite will make it easier to maintain the Harmonizome, allowing it to continue to serve researchers with up-to-date harmonized biomedical data.",Data Analysis; Data Science; Dataset; Extract Transform Load (ETL); Graphical User Interface (GUI); Information Threat; Relational Database; Transformer; User Interface (UI); Visualization

With Digital Data Consumption at its peak, the world has turned to Big Data for maintenance and analytics of this data. Private companies and research institutions capture terabytes of data about their users‚Äô interactions, business, social media, and also sensors from devices such as mobile phones and automobiles. The challenge of this era is to make sense of this sea of data. For this reason, we have come up with this tutorial on ""Big Data Analytics""

The volume of data that one has to deal with has exploded to unimaginable levels in the past decade, and at the same time, the price of data storage has systematically reduced. Big Data Analytics largely involves collecting data from different sources, merge it in a way that it becomes available to be consumed by analysts, and finally deliver data products useful to the organization business. 

The process of converting large amounts of unstructured raw data, retrieved from different sources to a data product useful for organizations forms the core of Big Data Analytics.

BigData is the latest buzzword in the IT Industry. Apache‚Äôs Hadoop is a leading Big Data platform used by IT giants Yahoo, Facebook & Google. In this tutorial, we have covered all the important topics such as, What is Big Data and Hadoop, What is Hive, What are their features and much more that will help you to get a hold over this concept.

The following pointers will be covered in this video:
00:00:00 Introduction

Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning

Instructors:
- Chris Manning
- Richard Socher

Natural language processing (NLP) deals with the key artificial intelligence technology of understanding complex human language communication. This lecture series provides a thorough introduction to the cutting-edge research in deep learning applied to NLP, an approach that has recently obtained very high performance across many different NLP tasks including question answering and machine translation. It emphasizes how to implement, train, debug, visualize, and design neural network models, covering the main technologies of word vectors, feed-forward models, recurrent neural networks, recursive neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and recent models involving a memory component.

What Is Microsoft Excel?
Excel is one of the best applications available on the market for creating spreadsheets to crunch numbers and dashboard reports as well as storing and administering data. This software first appeared on the scene back in 1987, and since then it has grown to become one of the most popular pieces of software for home or business.

What Is Excel Dashboard?
An excel dashboard is a visual interface that provides an overview of key measures relevant to a particular objective with the help of charts and graphs. Dashboard reports allow managers to gain a high-level overview of the business and help them make quick decisions. There are different types of dashboards such as strategic dashboards, analytical dashboards, and operational dashboards.

P5LzXjil004,Which NoSQL Database Should I Learn?,Techy Help,https://youtube.com/watch?v=P5LzXjil004,2014-03-31T23:09:52Z,Which NoSQL database should I learn? MongoDB is one of the simplest NoSQL databases to install and learn. MongoDB sounds like a band based on the ...,47.0,NOSQL,"Which NoSQL database should I learn?

MongoDB is one of the simplest NoSQL databases to install and learn.

MongoDB sounds like a band based on the Flash Gordon villain.

MongoDB is one of the most popular NoSQL databases, so that's one of the most likely ones you could get paid to support. Mongo has secondary indexes like other NoSQL databases, but it is otherwise similar to database modeling.

What's the downside? There always is one.

Mongo starts to fail when it gets bigger than your machine's working memory. Mongo has horrible documentation and user support.

I want to find out which NoSQL is like HTML, the fastest and easiest to learn.

Redis is one of the easiest NoSQL systems there is to learn. If they joke you can learn the HTML programming language in a weekend, they should seriously recognize they can learn Redis in an afternoon.

That's as long as it takes to download some of its competitors.

There is a downside. Redis modeling is incredibly complex.

So I get 90% up the learning curve in a day and spend a few months learning modeling. That's not unlike learning the basics of Oracle support in a month and years figuring out stored procedures.

Cassandra is increasing in popularity.

I see gray clouds of doubt on the horizon.

Don't be a Cassandra. Cassandra requires you to change how you model your data but it works great with Java.

I think everything goes well with Java because JVM is so important.

I wonder why you want to learn NoSQL. Those databases are supposedly designed to have minimal need for DBAs.

They still need a DBA, and the first one trained and in the door is the one they keep.

So go with Mongo to learn one of the most common ones, and learn Redis as a fast backup.

I thought Mongo had faster backups.

https://www.cloudera.com/products/fast-forward-labs-research.html

Cloudera Fast Forward Labs‚Äô latest applied machine learning research report is about boosting natural language processing (NLP) with transfer learning. Organizations large and small have volumes of valuable data stored as free-form text yet the scale of data combined with the complexities of language processing makes using it to drive insight and automation a challenge.

While deep learning applied to NLP produces models powerful enough to automatically answer questions, translate languages, detect emotion, and even generate human-like language, these models are complex and unwieldy, making them too costly to build and incorporate into real-world systems without vast data, skilled human experts, and expensive infrastructure.

This report introduces transfer learning, a method of training models that solves these problems through knowledge reuse.  You‚Äôll see how deep learning for NLP and transfer learning are combined to improve the accuracy and robustness of models and reduce the cost of using advanced techniques, making NLP more practical, accessible and powerful than ever before.",Accuracy; Automation; Boosting; Cloudera; Deep Learning; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing (NLP); Research; Training

It has a great potential and the kind of features it provides are so easy to understand and simple to use that every student, manager, marketing executive or sales guy can easily create brilliant professional presentations. Microsoft Office PowerPoint is often underestimated but it allows us to create presentations, logos, banners, templates, designs, graphics, and most importantly video animations. 

A PowerPoint Presentation designed appropriately can really convince your target audience. A lot of design thinking needs to be put into a slide to make sure that the message is clearly delivered to the user.

JavaScript was earlier used for designing pop-ups, changing of pictures ,etc.
JavaScript can be used for creating Hybrid Apps.
JS can also be used for creating UI for websites.
JS can be used for website backend too.
So finally I conclude saying JavaScript is a language which can be used for mobile development, website,etc.
Highly recommended language to learn currently.

QVMiUF7PYeI,Learn Excel Dashboard and Reports Design Rules,Mellon Training,https://youtube.com/watch?v=QVMiUF7PYeI,2015-01-17T16:22:12Z,An Excel dashboard is a visual interface.

It displays data graphically and provides at-a-glance views into key measures. How you can have a simpler and more effective dashboard design? Here are the 10 basic rules:
1) First of all, simplify your dashboard. Don‚Äôt include too much data or too much
information in a report. Keep it simple. Also, the less fancy formatting your dashboard has, the easier is to read. Charts should present your data as simple as possible.
2) Avoid using background fills or fancy effects like shadows, gradients, or glow. Also, pictures or clipart doesn‚Äôt help.
3) Remove elements that don‚Äôt contribute to the core message. Here are some examples:
a) Remove borders
b) Avoid data labels that are not necessary
c) Remove gridlines (vertical and horizontal)
d) Remove axis that don‚Äôt use
4) Try to fit your dashboard and your data on one page (maybe you can adjust column and row width or reduce white space).
5) Put your most important measures to the upper left side of Excel worksheet. Users
pay attention to specific regions.
6) Use descriptive titles for each component.
7) Use effective format numbers.
8) Include a timestamp on your dashboard (monthly or yearly, for example).
9) When it‚Äôs necessary, use a few comments or labels to help users clarify your model.
10) Make sure that the users have to click a few times to get their data and the navigation
is easy.

https://heynode.com/tutorial/etl-pipeline-what-are-we-building

We're going to learn about using Extract, Transform, Load pipelines for handling large datasets with Node.js. We will use two different approaches to creating an ETL pipeline:

1. Basic ETL pipeline that retrieves all the relevant data at once from a remote data source.
2. ETL pipeline that uses Node.js Streams to process data from a local CSV file of any size.

Along the way you will learn about the different stages of an ETL pipeline, how to use Promises and async/await in Node.js, how to interact with the file system using the fs module, and how to use Streams.

Plotly's Python graphing library makes interactive, publication-quality graphs. It's based on JavaScript and similar to Bokeh which I covered last week. I especially like using Plotly for creating 3D interactive plots. It has an intuitive API for passing the data and creating the grid required for 3D plotting. Much simpler and flexible compared to other libraries.

In addition, in this video I'm also doing some analysis on cost function surfaces, using Plotly to visualize them and explore their appearance for a linear model and a simple neural network.

With these ""Machine Learning & Data Science Open Source Spotlight"" weekly videos, my objective is to introduce many game-changing libraries, which I believe many people can benefit from.

Bhavya Venugopal was the winner of the Hackfest organized by Edureka in December 2014. Her Twitter-powered travel suggestions app, #YourTravelCompanion, aims at giving current and more relevant information to users based on Twitter data. For example, events currently happening in a city, or a local favorite restaurant wouldn‚Äôt generally show up on a conventional travel-suggestions app, but people use Twitter a lot to showcase a place or event when they love it. And if it‚Äôs on Twitter, it‚Äôs definitely on #YourTravelCompanion!

What is a Decision Tree Algorithm?
A Decision Tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm for solving classification problems. Generally, a decision tree is drawn upside down with its root at the top and it is known as the Top-Down Approach. Decision trees are used for handling non-linear data sets effectively. The decision tree tool is used in real life in many areas, such as engineering, civil planning, law, and business.

This video is a dose of Excel data-cleansing reality.

Someone asked for help cleansing a column of dates so they could be sorted. As I explored the data in Excel and Power Query to see what was wrong, I uncovered deeper problems.

There weren't just formatting issues. One date had a year ""20165."" So many red flags piled up and this is when the responsible thing to so is STOP! This data cannot be trusted. Send the data back to the source for verification and validation.

In this video, Rohit Ghosh introduces NLP in the context of Data Science and Machine Learning. So, what is NLP? NLP is natural language processing, and deals with the data science being used on human language. 

01:34  NLP Introduction
04:00  extension of a supervised machine learning part
06:05  cleansing data wrangling part of NLP
10:05  What is NLP Anyway
12:45  chatbots recommender systems

Human language is unstructured data, and it needs to be processed for machines to perform data science, and in this video, we are going to cover what is natural language processing. We will be touching upon NLP projects and some applications in natural language processing. NLP is part of machine learning and therefore also part of the machine learning course. The difference lies primarily in the feature engineering aspect. There are no new concepts to learn. 

As any NLP tutorial will tell you, it is similar to time series as both are domain-specific understanding of machine learning problems. The applications of NLP are the same kind of supervised machine learning things that you would have already seen in the rest of your machine learning course. 

In the machine learning course thus far, you have learned python for data science, statistics, supervised machine learning, and unsupervised machine learning. NLP is an extension of supervised machine learning. 

Some of the applications in natural language processing are in spam detection, chatbots, and recommender systems.

===
Hi! My name is Filip and I'm a data scientist at DataCamp. DataCamp is an online data science school. You'll take fun video lessons, like the one you're watching now and solve interactive coding challenges, where you receive instant and detailed feedback. All this happens in the comfort of your browser, so you can immediately start learning the skill of the future.

In this introduction to R course you will learn about the basics of R, as well as the most common data structures it uses to store data. By the end of this course, you will know how to create these data structures, manipulate them and perform calculations on them to get surprising insights.

But first things first: the basics of R. It's also called the language for statistical computing, and is one of the most popular languages to do data science, used by tons of companies and universities around the globe in all sorts of fields. Optimizing a financial portfolio? Mapping marketing data? Analyzing outcomes of clinical trials? You name it, R can handle it.

But why did R become so popular? Well, first of all, it's free to use! Next, R's visualization capabilities are top notch, making it easy to build beautiful plots. It's also easy to create so-called packages, which are extensions to R. R's very active community has created thousands of these packages for many different fields. Last but not least, R is an actual programming language, with a command-line interface for executing code. This is a big plus compared to other point-and-click programs out there. It might take some energy to fully get the hang of it, but feat not: DataCamp is here to help you master R in no time! Let's get started.

An important component of R, is the console. It's a place where you can execute R commands. In DataCamp's interactive interface, the console can be found here. Let's try to calculate the sum of 1 and 2. We simply type 1 + 2 at the prompt the console and hit Enter. R interprets what you typed and prints the result.

R is more than a scientific calculator, though. You can also create so-called variables. A variable allows you to store data in R for later use. You can use the less than sign followed by a dash to create a variable. Suppose the height of a rectangle is 2. Let's assign this value 2 to a variable height. In the console, we type height, less than sign, dash, 2:

This time, R does not print anything, because it assumes that you will be using this variable in the future. If you now simply type and execute height in the console, R returns 2:

We can do a similar thing for the width of our imaginary rectangle. We assign the value 4 to a variable width.

Typing width gives us 4, great.

As you're assigning variables in the R console, you're actually accumulating the R workspace. It's the place where R variables 'live'. You can list all variables with the ls() function. Simply type ls followed by empty parentheses and hit enter.

This shows you a list of all the variables you have created up to now. There are two objects in your workspace at the moment, height and width. I we try to access variable that's not in the workspace, depth for example, R throws an error.

Suppose you now want to find out the area of our imaginary rectangle, which is height multiplied by width. height equals 2, and width equals 4, so the result is 8. Let's also assign this result to a new variable, area.

Inspecting the workspace again with ls, shows that the workspace contains three objects now: area, height and width.

Now, this is all great, but what if you want to recalculate the area of your imaginary rectangle when the height is 3 and the width is 6? You'd have to reassign the variables width and height in the console, and then recalculate the area. That's quite some coding you'd have to redo, isn't it?

This is the place where R scripts come in! An R script is simply a text file with succesive lines of R code. Let's create such a script, ""rectangle.R"", that contains the code that we've written up to now.

Next, you can run this script. In the DataCamp interface, you can do this with the 'Submit Answer' button. R goes through your code, line by line, executing every command one by one in the console, just as if you are typing each command yourself. The cool thing is, that if you want to change your code, you can simply adapt your script and run it again. Let's change the height to 3 and the width to 6, and rerun the script. The variables are given different values this time, and the output changes accordingly.",Coding; Command-Line Interface; Computing; Dash; Data Science; Data Structure; LeSS; Mapping; Marketing; Microsoft Access; Programming Language; R; Sports; Variable; Video; Visualization

Artificial Intelligence is only as powerful as the quality of the data collection, ...",3.0,Data Preparation,"In this video, Alina discusses how to prepare data for Machine Learning and AI. Artificial Intelligence is only as powerful as the quality of the data collection, so it's important to prepare data for Machine learning correctly to ensure no data bias in the prediction models.

We received a lot of questions about how much data someone needs to run a prediction model for a business, and how to avoid common mistakes in data collection for AI. The answer is you don't need big-data to run AI models and Machine learning models, it can be done with ‚Äòmedium-data‚Äô!

It's also important to be careful with the quality of data collected for Machine learning and AI. Marketers must be careful, all the data that we collect for machine learning models can be subject to bias. This bias can fall into many categories, two common ones are selection bias and exclusion bias. And both types can affect the usability and relevance of your AI models and findings.

Selection bias is when the group of users used for data collection is not like your target audience. Exclusion bias is when you've already collected your data, but you hold back bits of your information from your analysis.

Artificial Intelligence reveals unexpected insights and good data collection is driven by knowing we're all subject to bias. So instead of only feeding a subset of your data to a machine learning model, dump it all in. Even the stuff you think is irrelevant. If it's irrelevant, the algorithm will ignore it.

Just remember:

- You don't need big data when you prepare data for machines learning & A.I. , you only need medium data. 
- Make sure that you try to avoid bias as much as possible when you collect data for A.I. 

This video covers:

Please find the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQ9UzYueBs0

In continuation to that, we will go over different ""Types of NoSQL Databases"" and why you should know them in preparation for your next tech company interview. In our humble opinion, knowledge about these data stores and their working will help you immensely in any system design interview.

In this video, we drew out key differences between Aggregated-Oriented Databases and Non-Aggregate Oriented Databases.

One by one we looked at different types of NoSQL databases such as:
1. Key-value datastore: Like DynamoDB
2. Document datastore: Like MongoDB
3. Columnar datastore: Like Amazon Redshift
4. Graph datastore: Neo4j
5. Time-series datastore: Like InfluxDB

We have also got this content in text format which you can check at our website by clicking this link here: https://www.techtakshila.com/system-design/chapter-5/

We hope you guys enjoy these type of videos. We are hoping to release a lot more like these in near future. Hope to hear your feedbacks.

In this video I explain how to use a formula with SUMPRODUCT to convert the time stored as text into numeric time values in Excel.
Download the Excel file to follow along: 

Read the full article: https://www.excelcampus.com/functions/convert-text-to-time-values-formulas/

In a previous video (https://youtu.be/uhzLYTupl9I) I shared this challenge to convert time/duration stored as text into time values that can be used for calculations and analytics.

Thanks to everyone that commented on the video and blog post with solutions.  In this video we look at a solution that combines the text functions from part 1 (https://youtu.be/rqypEnQszPk) with the SUMPRODUCT function.

This allows us to convert all the time increments (hours, minutes, seconds) into seconds within a single formula.  We then divide by the total number of seconds in a day to return the time value.

In the video I walk through writing the formula.

You will learn how to use an array (list) of values within SUMPRODUCT.  We can feed the search function multiple values to extract time period.

The array of values are listed in curly brackets.

{""h"",""m"",""sec""}

I also explain how the SUMPRODUCT function calculates these arrays by multiplying the items together and then summing them up.

In the video I use an Excel Table.  Checkout my video on a Beginner's Guide to Excel Tables (https://youtu.be/fJnJTff4Na8) if you are not familiar with this awesome feature of Excel.

Here is a link to the first solution video: https://youtu.be/rqypEnQszPk

In the next video we look at how to use Power Query to solve this challenge (https://youtu.be/1h94nq4if28).",Analytical; Array; Blogging; Data Cleansing; Microsoft Excel; Table; Video; Writing; jQuery

UY6xbrcViVw,AI Inspection: Machine Learning / Computer Vision for Visual Defect Detection,MobiDev,https://youtube.com/watch?v=UY6xbrcViVw,2020-01-13T11:05:28Z,Watch how AI visual inspection operates. Learn more at https://mobidev.biz/blog/ai-visual-inspection-deep-learning-computer-vision-defect-detection AI Visual ...,27.0,Computer Vision,"Watch how AI visual inspection operates. Learn more at  https://mobidev.biz/blog/ai-visual-inspection-deep-learning-computer-vision-defect-detection 

AI Visual defect inspection based on machine learning and computer vision techniques is used for the defect and mismatch assessment. It can be used in such industries as retail, manufacturing, airport baggage screening, the food industry, medicine, etc.

Let‚Äôs see how AI inspection works!

Recent progress in computer vision makes it possible to use advanced deep learning technologies for visual inspection. Images captured by a camera are processed by a neural network which is trained to detect and localize the defect. Once the visual inspection system is confident about where the problem is, it takes predefined actions, like sending a notification or executing other operations.

What are the possibilities of AI visual inspection for business?

Let‚Äôs imagine that we are producing sunflower oil. Even during production,  bottles can be damaged that may result in additional costs and trouble during transportation. Thus, visual inspection based on the computer vision model detects the mismatch and notifies us in real-time so that defective objects can be excluded before they reach the final packaging stage.

Another example: different working areas on a plant requires workers to have certain equipment to be worn. Like helmets, gloves or boots. The neural network is able to analyze stream from monitoring cameras and notify if anyone working in the areas violates the requirements for this certain zone.

What is required for AI inspection implementation?

A correctly trained neural network ensures high accuracy of the quality management system. The network can be trained with many images of different objects. The network architecture depends on the task: Image Classification, Object Detection or Semantic Segmentation. Depending on how precisely we'd like to determine the defect or mismatch, we define the task and train network so as to detect any meaningful deviations from the ‚Äústandard‚Äù appearance.

These technologies can be applied by our team in your own projects.

üîµ  Why MongoDB is important?

MongoDB stores data in a JSON document format. This allows you to throw whatever data you want from it without worrying about the relations of the data. The fact that it is a JSON store also means that information can be retrieved very quickly. Things that would take minutes for relational databases to find can be found in MongoDB in mere seconds. Basically, in any situation where the data isn‚Äôt relational and needs to be processed quickly, MongoDB is the database you should be choosing. This is why in most big data workplaces, you will find MongoDB (or a similar database) being used instead of the databases we are used to.

üîµ  Why should you opt for a MongoDB career?

If you want to fast-track your career then you should strongly consider MongoDB. The reason for this is that it is one of the fastest-growing technology. There is a huge demand for MongoDB. The salaries for MongoDB are fantastic. There is a huge growth opportunity in this domain as well.

PowerPoint is an enterprise level software and an amazing product of Microsoft Office. It has a great potential and the kind of features it provides are so easy to understand and simple to use that every student, manager, marketing executive or sales guy can easily create brilliant professional presentations. Microsoft Office PowerPoint is often underestimated but it allows us to create presentations, logos, banners, templates, designs, graphics, and most importantly video animations. 

A PowerPoint Presentation designed appropriately can really convince your target audience. A lot of design thinking needs to be put into a slide to make sure that the message is clearly delivered to the user.

I have created all the videos in PowerPoint included in Microsoft Office 365 suite. My idea is to help my audience learn the PowerPoint and get to know how easy it is to create anything in presentation.

The topic we choose, our tone, our selection of words, everything adds some type of information that can be interpreted and value can be extracted from it.

But there is a problem: one person may generate hundreds or thousands of words in a declaration, each sentence with its corresponding complexity. If you want to scale and analyze several hundred, thousands, or millions of people or declarations in a given geography, then the situation is unmanageable.

This Alphabet song in our Let's Learn About the Alphabet Series is all about the consonant r. Your children will be engaged in singing, ...",14.0,R,"Learn the letter R. This Alphabet song in our Let‚Äôs Learn About the Alphabet Series is all about the consonant r.

Your children will be engaged in singing, listening and following along as they‚Äôll learn to:  identify the alphabet letter, form the upper and lower case letter and say the letter b sound clearly and accurately. Your children will be engaged in singing, listening and following along as they‚Äôll learn to:  identify the alphabet letter, form the upper and lower case letter, say the letter sound clearly and accurately. They will see, hear and say the letter and its sound as a beginning and ending sound with a variety of storytelling words.
This letter song also includes a catchy chorus that will motivate your children to want to learn about the alphabet, and at the end, an inspirational reading rap.
All of the alphabet songs in this series have a great beat, lots of repetition and curriculum-based reading and language arts content that meets state, national and common core standards.  All of the letters that we use and the way we form the letters follow the Zaner-Bloser Handwriting Manuscript.
Your children will want to sing this catchy, cool, reading skill song over and over.  They will hear the consonant sound at the beginning and at the end of each word.

Listening to this engaging, reading, skill-building alphabet song and following all the printed words and entertaining visuals, your children will develop their phonological awareness, phonics and language arts skills.  
The very helpful educational feature of each song is a close-up of Jack saying each letter sound clearly.  Your children will be able to see how Jack forms his mouth to say the sound correctly.  Children can model these mouth positions so they can say the letter sounds correctly, too.  We hope your children both enjoy and learn from each one of the alphabet songs in our Let‚Äôs Learn About the Alphabet Series.  Sing and watch them over and over again.
And, as an extension activity, see if you and your children can think of new words and stories for each letter.  We found searching for words for each letter to be very challenging and really a lot of fun.

Why Learn Hadoop?

Big Data! A Worldwide Problem?

According to Wikipedia, ""Big data is collection of data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional data processing applications.""

The problem lies in the use of traditional systems to store enormous data. Though these systems were a success a few years ago, with increasing amount and complexity of data, these are soon becoming obsolete. The good news is - Hadoop, which is not less than a panacea for all those companies working with BIG DATA in a variety of applications and has become an integral part for storing, handling, evaluating and retrieving hundreds of terabytes, and even petabytes of data.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

Opportunities for Hadoopers!

Opportunities for Hadoopers are infinite - from a Hadoop Developer, to a Hadoop Tester or a Hadoop Architect, and so on. If cracking and managing BIG Data is your passion in life, then think no more and Join Edureka's Hadoop Online course and carve a niche for yourself!

Customer Review:

Michael Harkins, System Architect, Hortonworks says: ‚ÄúThe courses are top rate. The best part is live instruction, with playback. But my favorite feature is viewing a previous class. Also, they are always there to answer questions, and prompt when you open an issue if you are having any trouble. Added bonus ~ you get lifetime access to the course you took!!! Edureka lets you go back later, when your boss says ""I want this ASAP!"" ~ This is the killer education app...

Why Learn Deep Learning With TensorFlow?
TensorFlow is one of the best libraries to implement Deep Learning. TensorFlow is a software library for numerical computation of mathematical expressions, using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that flow between them. It was created by Google and tailored for Machine Learning. In fact, it is being widely used to develop solutions with Deep Learning.

What Is R Programming?
R is an open-source programming language used for statistical computing. It is one of the most popular programming languages today. R was inspired by S+, which is similar to the S programming language. R has various data structures and operators. It can be integrated with other programming languages like C, C++, Java, and Python.

Time series is any data set where the values are measured at different points in time. Many times series are uniformly spaced at a specific frequency. Time series can also be irregularly spaced and sporadic. A time series is a sequence of data being recorded at specific time intervals. The past values are analyzed to forecast a future that is time-dependent. Compared to other forecast algorithms, with time series we deal with a single variable that is dependent on time.

Balance Sheet: A balance sheet is a financial statement that compares the assets and liabilities of a company to find the shareholder‚Äôs equity at a specific time. The balance sheet adheres to the following formula: Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders‚Äô Equity

Now, why are balance sheets important? -- The balance sheet helps an investor to judge how a company is managing its financials. The three balance sheet segments- Assets, liabilities, and equity, give investors an idea as to what the company owns and owes, as well as the amount invested by shareholders.

Typo correction: At 14 minutes 45 seconds, the last index on the bias vector is n, when it's supposed to in fact be a k.  Thanks for the sharp eyes that caught that!

For those who want to learn more, I highly recommend the book by Michael Nielsen introducing neural networks and deep learning: https://goo.gl/Zmczdy

There are two neat things about this book.  First, it's available for free, so consider joining me in making a donation Nielsen's way if you get something out of it.  And second, it's centered around walking through some code and data which you can download yourself, and which covers the same example that I introduce in this video.  Yay for active learning!

I also highly recommend Chris Olah's blog: http://colah.github.io/

Please note that in my videos I use the abbreviations:
SSR = Sum of Squares due to the Regression
SSE = Sum of Squares due to Error.

Intro: 0:00
Y-hat line: 2:26
Sample error term, e: 3:47
SSR, SSE, SST: 8:40
R-squared intro: 9:43
Population error term, Œµ: 12:11

Second video here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4otEcA3gjLk

Ever wondered WHY you have to SQUARE the error terms?? 

Here we deal with the very basics: what is regression? How do we establish a relationship between two variables? Why must we SQUARE the error terms? What exactly is SSE, SSR and SST? What is the difference between a POPULATION regression function and a SAMPLE regression line? Why are there so many different types of error terms??

It can be.  But there are certainly ways to make it easier for yourself to learn.  Join trainer Mark Lassoff to learn his five tips to make learning JavaScript coding easier for you.

Transcript
So you want to learn JavaScript?  But you‚Äôre wondering is JavaScript hard to learn.  The true answer is it can be, but, there are ways of making it easier!  I‚Äôm Mark Lassoff from Framework Television.  I‚Äôve taught JavaScript to hundreds of thousands of people online-- and Here are my five ways to make learning JavaScript easier.

Number 5-- Make JavaScript easier to learn by learning HTML5 first
While JavaScript is now used for a lot more than web development, its original home is on the web. Understanding HTML first provides an excellent context for understanding HTML.  It‚Äôs really hard to understand concepts like DOM manipulation without understanding HTML5. Learning HTML5 will also give you a way to show immediate results for your learning.  Being able to show results immediately will motivate you and keep you learning.  Besides, HTML is pretty easy to learn-- and its something that you‚Äôll need for almost any project you do on the web.

Number 4-- Make JavaScript easier to learn by learning vanilla JavaScript First
There are hundreds-- maybe thousands-- of JavaScript libraries out there.  Many are built to make JavaScript coding easier. For example, the jQuery library can compact a dozen ore more lines of code into two or three commands. Other libraries expand upon JavaScript extending its abilities.  Regardless, I recommend you learn plain, vanilla, JavaScript first. It may seem tougher at first, but people who learn libraries first often miss important fundamentals that they‚Äôre going to need.  Learn libraries after you have the fundamentals down and you‚Äôll benefit more!

Number 3-- Make JavaScript easier to learn by taking a formal course
Sure, there are thousands of JavaScript videos on Youtube.  And they‚Äôre all free.  But in this case, free has a cost.  In order to learn, you need a consistent curriculum and you need more than just videos.  A formal course will have been designed to teach you everything you need in an order that makes sense.  A good course will also give you lots of code labs to practice with.  Speaking of practice...

Number 2-- Make JavaScript easier to learn by practicing-- a lot
No one has learned to code by just watching videos.  It‚Äôs only by actually coding that you‚Äôll pick up the syntax, skills, and techniques used in development. When you learn, for example, to code a JavaScript while loop practice by writing several different types of loops that yield different results.  Keep practicing until you can write a loop without looking at a reference-- Then you know you understand the concept.


Number 1-- Make JavaScript easier to learn by doing projects.
Once you‚Äôve finished a curriculum for fundamental JavaScript, it‚Äôs time to start completing projects that force you to apply the JavaScript you‚Äôve learned.  There are dozens of APIs -- or application programming interfaces-- that can be accessed to make really neat JavaScript applications.  There are loads of project ideas to be found by just browsing the app store.  It doesn‚Äôt matter which projects you choose, just see the project through to the end so you learn to apply JavaScript in a real-world setting.

So instead of making JavaScript hard to learn, do yourself a favor and make it easy!  I‚Äôm Mark Lassoff for Framework Television.  See you next time.

MongoDB is a schema-less NoSQL document database - definition from freecodecamp.org
So, there is no need to write or learn complex database queries or create complicated schemas. 
Now, as you may have seen above that there are many advantages of using any ORM over writing Raw DB queries. Check out the video to know more.

JavaScript is a pain in the neck to learn. It‚Äôs a tricky language but as web developers, it‚Äôs a mandatory thing we need to pick up in order to do our jobs. 

So how to learn JavaScript? I recently stumbled across an all-out awesome method for learning JavaScript and all its little quirks.

Could this be the best way to learn JavaScript?

It's a very straightforward method but something that doesn't get mentioned a lot. Basically the idea came from Becca (@becca9941) who posted on Twitter how she was dealing with feelings of being overwhelmed at work. 

Much like journaling to express and organize ideas in one's head, Becca took a block of code and attacked it line by line. 

Noting that for a 60-line code block she had produced over 70 questions, she also asked for feedback to check her understanding. 

I only wish I had discovered this amazing method when I was first starting to learn JavaScript!

‚≠êWhy MongoDB is important?
MongoDB stores data in a JSON document format. This allows you to throw whatever data you want from it without worrying about the relations of the data. The fact that it is a JSON store also means that information can be retrieved very quickly. Things that would take minutes for relational databases to find can be found in MongoDB in mere seconds. Basically, in any situation where the data isn‚Äôt relational and needs to be processed quickly, MongoDB is the database you should be choosing. This is why in most big data workplaces, you will find MongoDB (or a similar database) being used instead of the databases we are used to.

‚≠êWhy should you opt for a MongoDB career?
If you want to fast-track your career then you should strongly consider MongoDB. The reason for this is that it is one of the fastest growing technology. There is a huge demand for MongoDB. The salaries for MongoDB is fantastic.There is a huge growth opportunity in this domain as well.

Learn MongoDB From Scratch - learn Programming Languages
Best Programming Languages Course
Everything you need to master MongoDB
Student should be able to compare and contrast the relational persistence model vs. the NoSQL model,Students should be able to set up and configure a development level MongoDB instance,Students should be able to write code to perform basic CRUD operations on a MongoDB instance (with both the Shell tool and a with a particular language‚Äôs syntax),Students should be familiar with modelling data for use in MongoDB,Students should be familiar with MongoDB‚Äôs capabilities and operational tools,Student should be immediately productive in quality MongoDB development
A student should have a computer with a modern web browser available for viewing course materials and for working in a browser-based development environment,A student should have an understanding of the concepts of basic web development and at least some experience in web development activities utilizing, at minimum, a small collection of development tools.,A student should have some familiarity and experience with using a common programming language, either object-oriented or scripting (i.e. Java, Python, Javascript, etc.).,Data is a very popular buzzword in the technology industry right now. As more and more people move their activities online, the data companies and websites collect on them will become even more relevant. And guess what that means? Programmers and developers who know their way around databases ‚Äì and more importantly, who can actually interpret and build things from them ‚Äì will be in high demand. MongoDB is one of the most dynamic databases out there, so getting to grips with it sooner rather than later means you‚Äôll stay well ahead of the curve.,Become a MongoDB Master,Approach Data in New Exciting Ways,This MongoDB online course has been designed for web developers, web designers, web architects, testers, site administrators, and pretty much anyone who already has a working knowledge of web development.¬† Although it‚Äôs not vital, knowing how to build web UI components and a familiarity with NoSQL persistence will help. This course is absolutely not limited to developers only, however.,The goal is to provide a solid foundation of MongoDB knowledge. To get you up and running on building your own web apps with MongoDB at their core, and to help you understand the capabilities, functionality and limitations of what this database can do.,You‚Äôll learn how to configure and run MongoDB, start importing data, and then quickly get stuck into creating new databases. You‚Äôll pick up Mongo Query Language commands and dive into one of MongoDB‚Äôs most powerful features, the Aggregation Framework. You‚Äôll work through detailed examples to gain an understanding of the various pieces of the puzzle, all the while learning about this database‚Äôs scaling, replication, and sharding abilities.,By the end of this course, those examples you‚Äôve been working on will all fit together to form a complete, working web application that‚Äôs fully integrated with MongoDB. And not only that, you‚Äôll have the confidence, knowledge and practice needed to start working on your own MongoDB projects straight away.,About MongoDB,MongoDB is an open source database with a document-oriented data model. It differs from a relational database in that instead of storing data in tables and rows, it stores JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas. Because of this, it lends developers the ability to create applications rooted in data in ways they never could before.,The target student for this course is a native English speaker who considers him/herself a practicing ‚Äúweb developer‚Äù.The developer should, ideally, be capable of building web UI components but also needs an understanding of NoSQL persistence (MongoDB in particular) as applied in modern web environments. However, this course is not limited to developers only. Any IT professional or hobbyist anticipating a solid understanding of how MongoDB works, how it's architected, administered, and/or developed for a web environment needs to enroll in this course.

Maybe you‚Äôve dabbled with unsupervised learning. 

But what about reinforcement learning?

It can be a little tricky to get all setup with RL. You need to manage environments, build your DL models and work out how to save your models down so you can reuse them. But that shouldn‚Äôt stop you! 

Why?

Because they‚Äôre powering the next generation of advancements in IOT environments and even gaming and the use cases for RL are growing by the minute. That being said, getting started doesn‚Äôt need to be a pain, you can get up and running in just 20 minutes working with Keras-RL and OpenAI. 

In this video you‚Äôll learn how to:
1. Create OpenAI Gym environments like CartPole
2. Build a Deep Learning model for Reinforcement Learning using Tensorflow and Keras
3. Train a Reinforcement Learning model using Deep Q Policy based learning using Keras-RL

SQL is the programming language you need to execute commands that let you create and manipulate a relational database. We will not delve into strict and detailed technical definitions to explain how it works. What you need to know is there are a few types of programming out there ‚Äì procedural (imperative), object-oriented, declarative, and functional. Although with some procedural elements, SQL is mainly regarded as a declarative programming language, it is nonprocedural.

This means, while coding, you will not be interested in how you want the job done. The focus is on what result you want to obtain. An abstract example would best clarify what we mean here. When using a procedural language, such as C or Java, you must explicitly divide the solution of a certain problem into several steps.

Why Learn Hadoop?

Big Data! A Worldwide Problem?

Big Data is a term given to large volumes of data that organizations store and process. However, it is becoming very difficult for companies to store, retrieve and process the ever-increasing data. If any company gets hold on managing its data well, nothing can stop it from becoming the next BIG success!

The problem lies in the use of traditional systems to store enormous data. Though these systems were a success a few years ago, with increasing amount and complexity of data, these are soon becoming obsolete. The good news is - Hadoop has become an integral part for storing, handling, evaluating and retrieving hundreds of terabytes, and even petabytes of data.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

Opportunities for Hadoopers!

Opportunities for Hadoopers are infinite - from a Hadoop Developer, to a Hadoop Tester or a Hadoop Architect, and so on. If cracking and managing BIG Data is your passion in life, then think no more and Join Edureka's Hadoop Online course and carve a niche for yourself!

About the Course
Edureka's Deep learning with Tensorflow course will help you to learn the basic concepts of TensorFlow, the main functions, operations and the execution pipeline. Starting with a simple ‚ÄúHello Word‚Äù example, throughout the course you will be able to see how TensorFlow can be used in curve fitting, regression, classification and minimization of error functions. This concept is then explored in the Deep Learning world. You will evaluate the common, and not so common, deep neural networks and see how these can be exploited in the real world with complex raw data using TensorFlow. In addition, you will learn how to apply TensorFlow for backpropagation to tune the weights and biases while the Neural Networks are being trained. Finally, the course covers different types of Deep Architectures, such as Convolutional Networks, Recurrent Networks and Autoencoders. 

Delve into neural networks, implement Deep Learning algorithms, and explore layers of data abstraction with the help of this Deep Learning with TensorFlow course.

Why Learn Deep Learning With TensorFlow?
TensorFlow is one of the best libraries to implement Deep Learning. TensorFlow is a software library for numerical computation of mathematical expressions, using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that flow between them. It was created by Google and tailored for Machine Learning. In fact, it is being widely used to develop solutions with Deep Learning. 

Machine learning is one of the fastest-growing and most exciting fields out there, and Deep Learning represents its true bleeding edge. Deep learning is primarily a study of multi-layered neural networks, spanning over a vast range of model architectures. Traditional neural networks relied on shallow nets, composed of one input, one hidden layer and one output layer. Deep-learning networks are distinguished from these ordinary neural networks having more hidden layers, or so-called more depth. These kinds of nets are capable of discovering hidden structures within unlabeled and unstructured data (i.e. images, sound, and text), which constitutes the vast majority of data in the world.

How Question Generation using Natural Language Processing (NLP) works

Let‚Äôs take a look at the secure authentication process when the user provides us with brief personal information. For example, just tell the name of a favorite football team. 
 
Next, the data mining algorithm collects information about this team from different sources, like web articles, a chapter in the textbook, PDF or even voice over.
 
Then, trained neural network handles context and extracts important information. And automatically generates questions to ask. For example, who's the head coach of your favorite football team? 
 
This process allows not to annoy users with long questionnaires and not to store predefined questions that are easy to hack. 
 
How to extract important information?
An article is tagged by named entity recognition. By using filters it‚Äôs possible to generate types for named entities, like Person, Nationality, Geographic, Organisation, Date, Product, etc. After information processing, the system generates questions.

Why Learn Hadoop?

Big Data! A Worldwide Problem?

According to Wikipedia, ""Big data is collection of data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional data processing applications.""

The problem lies in the use of traditional systems to store enormous data. Though these systems were a success a few years ago, with increasing amount and complexity of data, these are soon becoming obsolete. The good news is - Hadoop has become an integral part for storing, handling, evaluating and retrieving hundreds of terabytes, and even petabytes of data.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

Opportunities for Hadoopers!

Opportunities for Hadoopers are infinite - from a Hadoop Developer, to a Hadoop Tester or a Hadoop Architect, and so on. If cracking and managing BIG Data is your passion in life, then think no more and Join Edureka's Hadoop Online course and carve a niche for yourself!

TRANSCRIPT

Do you have to make presentations? Do you hate presentations? I like presentations, but one thing that you are probably maybe good at with presentations are making PowerPoint presentations, because you have visual aids to help you so you don't really have to talk as much, if you're nervous about talking. Presentation skills is something that you can work on. We have videos on www.engvid.com to help you with presentation skills. So, go and check those out for learning how to speak during presentations.

But what we're going to focus on today is the visual aspect of presentations, so your PowerPoint things. Some things to do, and some things not to do. So, here we are, presentation skills. The first thing and one of the things that makes these presentations so fun are pictures. But we have to be careful. The templates that you have already included in your presentation software, they're boring. People use them all the time. So, I suggest you try and download some other pictures to make your presentation more interesting. And with that, make sure that on one slide you have one image. Make it interesting.

Do not have a split screen. So, don't have two images on one slide. Do not have a collage, that's insane. A collage is many different small pictures on one screen. Even when I see a collage, there's a lot of collages coming out on Facebook now, and I'm like: ""Too many pictures. Can't understand."" Our brains just cannot comprehend all those pictures, especially when you're having the slide up for a short period of time. Don't make it like a photo album. Don't put millions and seven pictures, and... Keep it simple. Put a single image on each slide. Try and pick images that you actually like, and not too distracting. You don't want puppy dogs and things. Make something simple, but something that you like, and make sure it looks nice.

The next one you have to worry about is the lettering. So, the lettering, you also might know this as the font. So, font and lettering are the same. One thing that you do not want to do is have really fancy or beautiful lettering. Simply... The reason is some people can't read when the letters are fancy, especially if you are doing presentations for people whose... Do not have English as their first language, if you take the letters and you write them even cursive, a lot of people have problems reading cursive. So, I suggest you use something more traditional. There's lots of very easy-to-read fonts you can get from your... Whatever word processing you use. So, make it simple, easy to read.

Another problem that you might have is the script is too big or too small. So remember that when you're making your presentation, you're doing it probably on your laptop, or your desktop, or your iPad, or your phone, so the font or the lettering is going to be different than when you put it up on the projector. So if at all possible if you can, check it out before you do the presentation. Look at your... Hook up your laptop or whatever, and see if you can actually see it on the screen because the font is different. You might think that on your laptop it's a good size, but when it gets on the projection screen, it's tiny; or it takes up too much space and it's too big.

Next up are the words or the text. So, there's been studies done on how many lines of text a human can absorb or understand, and any more than six, you've lost the people. So, try and keep on each slide one very simple image, with very traditional clear text, and put only two or three lines on each slide. Don't put bullet points. If you have more than six lines or if you have bullet points, again, we just... We just can't remember them all. We just lose focus. We have something called too much information, too much info, TMI. ""Too much information"" means that if you have more than two or three lines, we're just not getting it. Our brain can't... We just can't learn it like you want us to.",English; Facebook; Golang; Image; Microsoft PowerPoint; Nice; Presentation; Processing; Rally; Template; Video

The majority of data in the world is unlabeled and unstructured. Shallow neural networks cannot easily capture relevant structure in, for instance, images, sound, and textual data. Deep networks are capable of discovering hidden structures within this type of data. In this TensorFlow course you'll use Google's library to apply deep learning to different data types in order to solve real world problems.

Traditional neural networks rely on shallow nets, composed of one input, one hidden layer and one output layer. Deep-learning networks are distinguished from these ordinary neural networks having more hidden layer, or so-called more depth. These kind of nets are capable of discovering hidden structures within unlabeled and unstructured data (i.e. images, sound, and text), which is the vast majority of data in the world.

TensorFlow is one of the best libraries to implement deep learning. TensorFlow is a software library for numerical computation of mathematical expressional, using data flow graphs. Nodes in the graph represent mathematical operations, while the edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors) that flow between them. It was created by Google and tailored for Machine Learning. In fact, it is being widely used to develop solutions with Deep Learning.

In this TensorFlow course, you will be able to learn the basic concepts of TensorFlow, the main functions, operations and the execution pipeline. Starting with a simple ‚ÄúHello Word‚Äù example, throughout the course you will be able to see how TensorFlow can be used in curve fitting, regression, classification and minimization of error functions. This concept is then explored in the Deep Learning world. You will learn how to apply TensorFlow for backpropagation to tune the weights and biases while the Neural Networks are being trained. Finally, the course covers different types of Deep Architectures, such as Convolutional Networks, Recurrent Networks and Autoencoders.

As computers play an increasing role in our daily lives there has been an growing demand for voice user interfaces, but speech is also terribly complicated. Vocabularies are diverse, sentence structures can often dictate the meaning of certain words, and computers also have to deal with accents, mispronunciations, and many common linguistic faux pas. The field of Natural Language Processing, or NLP, attempts to solve these problems, with a number of techniques we‚Äôll discuss today. And even though our virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, Google Home, Bixby, and Cortana have come a long way from the first speech processing and synthesis models, there is still much room for improvement.

It makes your data analysis process a lot more efficient. Even better, it's fairly simple to learn and start applying immediately to your work! Oftentimes, with just a few elegant lines of code, your data becomes that much easier to dissect and analyze. For these reasons, it is an essential and foundational skill to master for any aspiring data scientist.

Often one may be surprised how some easy-to-learn functions can make the data analysis process that much more efficient. That is certainly the case with dplyr. In this series, we will teach you how to use this incredibly useful package to mung data, while demonstrating with a Kaggle dataset on wine ratings. 

In Part 1 of this series, we will show you how:

Learning Mixtures of Linear Regressions with Nearly Optimal Complexity

ABSTRACT. Mixtures of Linear Regressions (MLR) is an important mixture model with many applications. In this model, each observation is generated from one of the several unknown linear regression components, where the identity of the generated component is also unknown. Previous works either assume strong assumptions on the data distribution or have high complexity. This paper proposes a fixed parameter tractable algorithm for the problem under general conditions, which achieves global convergence and the sample complexity scales nearly linearly in the dimension. In particular, different from previous works that require the data to be from the standard Gaussian, the algorithm allows the data from Gaussians with different covariances. When the conditional number of the covariances and the number of components are fixed, the algorithm has nearly optimal sample complexity $N = \tilde{O}(d)$ as well as nearly optimal computational complexity $\tilde{O}(Nd)$, where $d$ is the dimension of the data space. To the best of our knowledge, this approach provides the first such recovery guarantee for this general setting.",Algorithm; Complexity; Covariance; Linear Regression; Nonlinear Regression; Regression; Sales

We will do a recap of supervised machine learning as well as unsupervised machine learning. Supervised learning first.As we know it, supervised learning is a learning in which we teach or train the machine using data which are properly or rather correctly labeled.

And now unsupervised learning. Unsupervised learning is the learning of a machine using information that is neither classified nor labeled and allowing the algorithm to act on that information without guidance.


We know there are drawbacks in each of these two techniques. Supervised Machine Learning algorithm needs labeled data from which it will learn. We have an enormous amount of data available in the world, including texts, images, audios, videos, time-series and many more, but only a small fraction of such data is actually labeled. This process of labeling data, whether algorithmically or by hand, is a very costly process, especially when we are dealing with large volumes of data. 
On the other hand, the biggest disadvantage of any Unsupervised Machine Learning is that it‚Äôs application spectrum is limited.


But there are benefits as well in both. Can we do a handshaking between supervised and unsupervised learning and build a technique that will reduce the drawbacks and make use of the benefits that these techniques have? 
How about using the benefits of unsupervised learning and building clusters using the dataset? Unsupervised learning doesn‚Äôt work on the labeled data. So the cost of labeling the data is saved. And then using the benefits of supervised learning by using a small amount of labeled dataset and classifying the dataset as accurately as possible? We can do that. This technique is called semi-supervised machine learning.


Let‚Äôs summarize how semi-supervised machine learning works.
First, pick-up the large unlabeled dataset.
Second, label a small portion of the dataset.
Next, Put the unlabeled dataset into clusters using Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithm.
And then, build your model to use the labeled data to label and classify the rest of the unlabeled data.


Some applications of semi-supervised machine learning are
Internet Content Classification: There are million and millions of webpages. It is practically impossible to label all the webpages if you need to. Semi supervised machine learning helps here to classify the webpages.
Audio/ Video analysis: We have an overwhelming amount of audio and video files all over. Labeling them is a massive task, if not unfeasible. Semi supervised learning comes handy in audio/ video analysis.",Analysis; Audio; Classification; Dataset; Fraction; Image; Information Threat; Internet; Machine Learning Algorithm; Semi-supervised Machine Learning; Supervised Learning; Supervised Machine Learning; Time Series; Unsupervised Learning; Unsupervised Machine Learning; Video

Grade 6th on Khan Academy: By the 6th grade, you're becoming a sophisticated mathemagician. You'll be able to add, subtract, multiply, and divide any non-negative numbers (including decimals and fractions) that any grumpy ogre throws at you. Mind-blowing ideas like exponents (you saw these briefly in the 5th grade), ratios, percents, negative numbers, and variable expressions will start being in your comfort zone. Most importantly, the algebraic side of mathematics is a whole new kind of fun! And if that is not enough, we are going to continue with our understanding of ideas like the coordinate plane (from 5th grade) and area while beginning to derive meaning from data! (Content was selected for this grade level based on a typical curriculum in the United States.)

What is Deep Learning?
Deep learning can be considered as a subset of machine learning. It is a field that is based on learning and improving on its own by examining computer algorithms. While machine learning uses simpler concepts, deep learning works with artificial neural networks, which are designed to imitate how humans think and learn. Until recently, neural networks were limited by computing power and thus were limited in complexity. However, advancements in Big Data analytics have permitted larger, sophisticated neural networks, allowing computers to observe, learn, and react to complex situations faster than humans. Deep learning has aided image classification, language translation, speech recognition. 

Simplilearn‚Äôs Deep Learning course will transform you into an expert in deep learning techniques using TensorFlow, the open-source software library designed to conduct machine learning & deep neural network research.

MongoDB Tutorial for Beginners in Hindi. First, we will see the difference between MongoDB vs SQL then What is MongoDB in Hindi? MongoDB is an open-source document-based database management tool that stores data in JSON-like formats. It is a highly scalable, flexible and distributed NoSQL database.

Why MongoDB in Hindi?
MongoDB language is to implement a data store that provides high performance, high availability, and automatic scaling. MongoDB is extremely simple to install and implement. MongoDB uses JSON or BSON documents to store data.

MongoDB Course Content
1: SQL VS NoSQL 
2: Introduction & Installation MongoDB in Hindi
3: create, drop MongoDB Database 
4: create, drop collections in MongoDB in Hindi
5: CRUD operations in MongoDB in Hindi
6: MongoDB Comparison Operators in Hindi
7: MongoDB Logical Operators in Hindi
8: Mongo Shell Methods  
9:  Relationships in MongoDB in Hindi.
 

MongoDB CRUD operations create, read, update, and delete documents.

MongoDB Create Operations in Hindi
Create or insert operations add new documents to a collection. If the collection does not currently exist, insert operations will create the collection.

MongoDB provides the following methods to insert documents into a collection:

db.collection.insertOne() New in version 3.2
db.collection.insertMany() New in version 3.2

MongoDB Read Operations in Hindi 
Read operations retrieves documents from a collection; i.e. queries a collection for documents. MongoDB provides the following methods to read documents from a collection:

db.collection.find()

MongoDB Update Operations
Update operations modify existing documents in a collection. MongoDB provides the following methods to update documents of a collection:

db.collection.updateOne() New in version 3.2
db.collection.updateMany() New in version 3.2
db.collection.replaceOne() New in version 3.2
In MongoDB, update operations target a single collection. All write operations in MongoDB are atomic on the level of a single document.

‚úÖWhat is C++ Programming? 
C++ is an enhanced and extended version of C programming language, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979 as part of his Ph.D. project. Bjarne developed what he called ‚ÄòC with Classes‚Äô (later renamed C++) because he felt limited by the existing programming languages that were not ideal for large scale projects. He used C to build what he wanted because C was already a general-purpose language that was efficient and fast in its operations.

‚úÖC++ Career Prospects:
With just C++ programming expertise, you will have excellent job opportunities, salaries, and career prospects. However, for a career based on programming languages such as Java and Python (which are in more demand than C++) or for careers based on front-end, back-end, and full-stack development, you will go a lot further with C++ expertise. Furthermore, in development domains such as software testing, you are expected to know C++.

What Is R Programming?
R is an open-source programming language used for statistical computing. It is one of the most popular programming languages today. R was inspired by S+, which is similar to the S programming language. R has various data structures and operators. It can be integrated with other programming languages like C, C++, Java, and Python.

Time series is any data set where the values are measured at different points in time. Many times series are uniformly spaced at a specific frequency. Time series can also be irregularly spaced and sporadic. A time series is a sequence of data being recorded at specific time intervals. The past values are analyzed to forecast a future that is time-dependent. Compared to other forecast algorithms, with time series we deal with a single variable that is dependent on time.

What is Power BI?
Power BI is a technology-driven business intelligence tool provided by Microsoft for analyzing and visualizing raw data to present actionable information. It combines business analytics, data visualization, and best practices that help an organization to make data-driven decisions. In February 2019, Gartner confirmed Microsoft as Leader in the ""2019 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Analytics and Business Intelligence Platform"" as a result of the capabilities of the Power BI platform. Power BI is a business analytics service provided by Microsoft that lets you visualize your data and share insights. It converts data from different sources to build interactive dashboards and Business Intelligence reports.

Power BI Architecture:
Power BI architecture is a service built on top of Azure. There are multiple data sources that Power BI can connect to. Power BI Desktop allows you to create reports and data visualizations on the dataset. Power BI gateway is connected to on-premise data sources to get continuous data for reporting and analytics. Power BI services refer to the cloud services that are used to publish Power BI reports and data visualizations. Using Power BI mobile apps, you can stay connected to their data from anywhere. Power BI apps are available for Windows, iOS, and Android platforms.

What is a Power BI Dashboard?
A single page visualization with multiple charts and graphs to tell a story is called a Power BI dashboard. This one-page visualization in a dashboard is also known as a Canvas. The Power BI dashboard is a feature only available in Power BI Service. Since a Power BI dashboard is limited to one page, it only contains the highlights of a story. You cannot create a dashboard on Power BI Desktop. In a dashboard, visualizations are generated from reports, and each report is based on one dataset. The visualizations present on the dashboard are called tiles, and report designers pin these tiles to the dashboard.

Enabling deep learning frameworks ...",28.0,SPARK,"Data processing and deep learning are often split into two pipelines, one for ETL processing, the second for model training. Enabling deep learning frameworks to integrate seamlessly with ETL jobs allows for more streamlined production jobs, with faster iteration between feature engineering and model training. The newly introduced Horovod Spark Estimator API enables TensorFlow and PyTorch models to be trained directly on Spark DataFrames, leveraging Horovod‚Äôs ability to scale to hundreds of GPUs in parallel, without any specialized code for distributed training. With the new accelerator aware scheduling and columnar processing APIs in Apache Spark 3.0, a production ETL job can hand off data to Horovod running distributed deep learning training on GPUs within the same pipeline.

This breaks down the barriers between ETL and continuous model training. Operational and management tasks are lower, and data processing and cleansing is more directly connected to model training. This talk covers an end to end pipeline, demonstrating ETL and DL as separate pipelines, and Apache Spark 3.0 ETL with the Horovod Spark Estimator API to enable a single pipeline. We will demonstrate 2 pipelines ‚Äì one using Databricks with Jupyter notebooks to run ETL and Horovod, the second on YARN to run a single application to transition from ETL to DL using Horovod. The use of accelerators across both pipelines and Horovod features will be discussed.

11:44 Income statement analysis summary

Here is Walmart‚Äôs income statement, or profit and loss statement (P&L) for the fiscal years ended January 31st, 2017, 2016 and 2015. 2017 is on the left, 2015 on the right. The income statement can be found in the annual report. There is a lot of information here, we need to set priorities on which items we are going to dive into, to get the most valuable use of our analysis time.

My proposal would be to first dive into the revenue performance, which seems to have dropped from 2015 to 2016, and then has come back up in 2017. What are the main drivers for revenue?

Next I would look into the margin performance. How have gross margin, operating margin, and net income developed in relation to the fluctuations in revenue?

As #retail is traditionally a fairly low margin industry, every penny counts. Net Income is almost 9 billion dollars lower than Operating Income, let‚Äôs review what is going on in the interest and tax lines.

Philip de Vroe (The Finance Storyteller) aims to make strategy, #finance and leadership enjoyable and easier to understand. Learn the business vocabulary to join the conversation with your CEO at your company. Understand how #financialstatements work in order to make better stock market investment decisions.

Machine learning is quickly becoming a powerful tool for solving complex modeling problems across a broad range of industries. It is enabling engineers and scientists to develop models which learn from data and can be deployed as a part of packaged applications that can run efficiently on embedded systems as well as cloud infrastructure. The benefits of machine learning are being realized in applications everywhere, including predictive maintenance, health monitoring, financial portfolio forecasting, and advanced driver assistance.  However, successfully applying machine learning in practice presents several challenges. It is not always clear which data is going to be the most useful for prediction, and tuning machine learning hyperparameters can consume a large amount of time.

In this webinar, you will learn how machine learning tools in MATLAB address these challenges. We will demonstrate:

Working with large out-of-memory data using the MATLAB ‚Äútall‚Äù framework
Reducing dimensionality and identifying import features using advanced feature selection techniques
Best practices for tuning hyperparameters to optimize the performance of your model
How to deploy models for use in production IT systems or embedded devices",Embedded System; Feature Selection; Forecasting; Information Technology (IT); MATLAB; Machine Learning; Modelling; Simulink; Video

kdlIlIIHCz0,"C++ for C programmers -- lesson 1 (classes, constructors, methods, templates, is it efficient?)",Bisqwit,https://youtube.com/watch?v=kdlIlIIHCz0,2014-10-01T20:00:43Z,"Are you familiar with C, or with languages based on C? This video gives a quick introduction to C++: a very small core set of things that are new in C++ ...",48.0,C++,"Are you familiar with C, or with languages based on C? This video gives a quick introduction to C++: a very small core set of things that are new in C++ compared to C. [Subtitles/Captions available]

Topics covered, in order:
- Bidirectional linked list in C
- What is a class (it is a struct)
- Methods
- Struct is a type (typedef is not needed)
- Constructing and destructing
- Template classes
- std::list is already in STL (C++ standard library)
- performance impact (none at all)

Twitter: https://twitter.com/RealBisqwit
Patreon: https://patreon.com/Bisqwit (alternatives at https://iki.fi/bisqwit/donate.html)
Twitch: https://twitch.tv/RealBisqwit
Homepage: https://iki.fi/bisqwit/

Things I forgot to mention:
- methods (member functions) do not increase the size of the struct/class at all. They literally work just the same way as the original C code in this video works, even though they're defined in between the struct's { and }. Memory usage per class instance is not increased (and scalability is not hurt), no matter how many methods the class defines.

Topics intentionally omitted for clarity and brevity, even though they would be good style for this program:
- copy constructor / assign operators
- member initialization in constructor
- public and private
- std::string rather than const char*
- const references rather than T verbatim
- exception safety

It's been a while since I last published videos containing English speech. I think I've taken a step backwards towards robotic speech, due to lack of practice. Sorry about that. English is still not my native language!

Database Management Systems (In Tamil )  ‚ÄìThis video explains DBMS history and needs of DBMS. 

Database Management Systems  :

            A database-management system (DBMS) is a computer-software application that interacts with end-users, other applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze data. A general-purpose DBMSallows the definition, creation, querying, update, and administration of databases.

                  A DBMS makes it possible for end users to create, read, update and delete data in a database. The DBMS essentially serves as an interface between the database and end users or application programs, ensuring that data is consistently organized and remains easily accessible.

              The DBMS is perhaps most useful for providing a centralized view of data that can be accessed by multiple users, from multiple locations, in a controlled manner. A DBMS can limit what data the end user sees, as well as how that end user can view the data, providing many views of a single database schema. End users and software programs are free from having to understand where the data is physically located or on what type of storage media it resides because the DBMS handles all requests.

Warren Buffett is one of the richest men in the world. One of the key components to his multi-billionaire success has been his ability buy companies with a sustainable competitive advantage. Think Coca-Cola, Moody‚Äôs or See‚Äôs Candy. For this video, we are going to see if we can mimic his success on how to make money, by learning how to identify companies with such a sustainable competitive advantage. More specifically, we are going to learn how to do this by analysing a stock market company‚Äôs financial statements ‚Äì the income statement, the balance sheet and the cash flow statement. This is a top 5 takeaways video of ‚ÄúWarren Buffett and the interpretation of financial statements‚Äù, written by Mary Buffett and David Clark.

Top 5 takeaways from Warren Buffett and the Interpretation of Financial Statements:

01:25 1. Consistency is King
03:32 2. What Warren Buffett is Looking for in an Income Statement
05:40 3. What Warren Buffett is Looking for in a Balance Sheet
08:00 4. What Warren Buffett is Looking for in a Cashflow Statement
09:50 5. When to Sell

TL;DW:

- When you are looking for a business with a durable competitive advantage, the keyword is consistency
- In the income statement, look for consistently growing net earnings and profit margins that consistently beat the competitors
- When observing the balance sheet, remember that the superior business has a high return on capital, that it seldom requires a lot of debt, and that retained earnings typically shows a steady growth
- In the cash flow statement, you want to make sure that the business is producing money for its shareholders, by examining its capital expenditures
- Even a fantastic business should be sold if you need money elsewhere, its competitive advantage is at stake, or if the price tag is at a crazy level

My goal with this channel is to help you make more money and improve your personal finances. How to become a millionaire? There are many ways to get there ‚Äì investing in the stock market, becoming a stock trader, doing real estate investing, or why not becoming an entrepreneur? But whether you are interested in how to invest in stocks or investing strategies for creating passive income with rental properties ‚Äì I hope to be able to provide you with a solution (or at least an idea) here. Warren Buffett - the greatest investor of our time - says that you should fill your mind with competing ideas and then see what makes sense to you. This channel is about filling your mind with those ideas. And in the process ‚Äì upgrading your money-making toolbox.",.NET Framework; Accounting; Balance Sheet; Cash-flow Statement; Finance; Financial Statement; Income Statement; Real Estate; Stock Market; Trade; Video

lGzT91ETgFk,Should you learn C++ in 2020 - What &amp; Why to learn c++? (Mastering C++ - Part 1),Dot Net,https://youtube.com/watch?v=lGzT91ETgFk,2020-07-19T08:24:58Z,"Because C++, like the PC, is hardly replaceable.

The most popular OS, Windows, have their kernels written in C ground up, alongside with C++ with the more advance feature. Try telling the Kernel dev team to replace their C/C++ base code to the very thing they invented, C#.

Sounds like a good idea? Except C# is not build directly on top of Assembly like how C is. And we all know C++ is built directly on top of C. The issue with these modern high level language is, they are really volatile. They are made 'cleaner' on the surface because they try to hide away the 'ugly' sides of code like C/C++. Programmers think that pointers are a hassle to keep track of? They try to make it automatic. Memory management? Introduce this magical thing call the garbage collector. Try to question these programmers who use language that have garbage collector on what exactly IS the garbage collector. I can strongly affirm that most of them can only give you a vague answer of what it is. Because the these language is designed to not want people to question it.

We still learn C++ till date because we still want controls over the machine that we are using. If it's just a simple UI software to do high level stuff? Sure, go ahead and use Java and C#. But we will always need engineers to learn C/C++ to maintain the roots of how everything begins. And we be glad that those languages are more readable than Assembly, which till date, is still learned for further optimization of the current C/C++.

I also seen newly trained game developers, think C++ is dying. ‚ÄúLook at how powerful Game Engine like Unity and Unreal is now! You don't need C++ to develop games anymore!‚Äù He said. My reply, ‚ÄúKid‚Ä¶ you have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. These beloved engines you are using, are all written and maintained in C++.‚Äù That's how ignorant some people could be just because they only look at the tip of the iceberg.

What is Artificial Intelligence?
Artificial Intelligence is the process of building intelligent machines from vast volumes of data. Systems learn from past learning and experiences and perform human-like tasks. It enhances the speed, precision, and effectiveness of human efforts. AI uses complex algorithms and methods to build machines that can make decisions on their own. Machine Learning and Deep learning forms the core of Artificial Intelligence. 

What is Deep Learning?
Deep learning can be considered as a subset of machine learning. It is a field that is based on learning and improving on its own by examining computer algorithms. While machine learning uses simpler concepts, deep learning works with artificial neural networks, which are designed to imitate how humans think and learn. Until recently, neural networks were limited by computing power and thus were limited in complexity. However, advancements in Big Data analytics have permitted larger, sophisticated neural networks, allowing computers to observe, learn, and react to complex situations faster than humans. Deep learning has aided image classification, language translation, speech recognition. It can be used to solve any pattern recognition problem and without human intervention.

Why Learn Hadoop?

Big Data! A Worldwide Problem?

According to Wikipedia, ""Big data is collection of data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional data processing applications."" In simpler terms, Big Data is a term given to large volumes of data that organizations store and process. However, it is becoming very difficult for companies to store, retrieve and process the ever-increasing data. If any company gets hold on managing its data well, nothing can stop it from becoming the next BIG success!

The problem lies in the use of traditional systems to store enormous data. Though these systems were a success a few years ago, with increasing amount and complexity of data, these are soon becoming obsolete. The good news is - Hadoop, which is not less than a panacea for all those companies working with BIG DATA in a variety of applications and has become an integral part for storing, handling, evaluating and retrieving hundreds of terabytes, and even petabytes of data.

Opportunities for Hadoopers!

Opportunities for Hadoopers are infinite - from a Hadoop Developer, to a Hadoop Tester or a Hadoop Architect, and so on. If cracking and managing BIG Data is your passion in life, then think no more and Join Edureka's Hadoop Online course and carve a niche for yourself!

Customer Review:

Michael Harkins, System Architect, Hortonworks says: ‚ÄúThe courses are top rate. The best part is live instruction, with playback. But my favorite feature is viewing a previous class. Also, they are always there to answer questions, and prompt when you open an issue if you are having any trouble. Added bonus ~ you get lifetime access to the course you took!!! Edureka lets you go back later, when your boss says ""I want this ASAP!"" ~ This is the killer education app...

Why learn Java?

Java is a general-purpose, class-based, object-oriented computer programming language that was designed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems in 1995.

Key Highlights of Java:
Platform Independent: This allows programmers to develop applications that can run on any operating system.

Usability of Java: Java is most widely used programming language. It is present everywhere. It really doesn't matter which domain you are working in, you will surely come across Java sooner or later!

Open Source: The good news is that Java is available for free! All the development tools and the environment (JRE & JDK) that is used to develop Java applications are absolutely free of cost.

Android: Irrespective of the fact that you are tech savvy or not, most of us are badly bitten by the Android bug! Android is in great demand today and fortunately you need Java for Android development. Hence, the importance of Java has increased even more.

Hadoop: Hadoop is one of the most trending framework for processing Big Data. It has been designed and developed in Java.

In spite of having a tough competition on the server side from Microsoft and other companies, Java is doing extremely well on mobile platforms, thanks to Android! It has also been the primary language for Hadoop Developers.

Why Learn Hadoop?

Big Data! A Worldwide Problem?

According to Wikipedia, ""Big data is collection of data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional data processing applications."" In simpler terms, Big Data is a term given to large volumes of data that organizations store and process. However, it is becoming very difficult for companies to store, retrieve and process the ever-increasing data. If any company gets hold on managing its data well, nothing can stop it from becoming the next BIG success!

The good news is - Hadoop has become an integral part for storing, handling, evaluating and retrieving hundreds of terabytes, and even petabytes of data.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

Opportunities for Hadoopers!

Opportunities for Hadoopers are infinite - from a Hadoop Developer, to a Hadoop Tester or a Hadoop Architect, and so on. If cracking and managing BIG Data is your passion in life, then think no more and Join Edureka's Hadoop Online course and carve a niche for yourself!

A study we conducted suggests that this new paradigm can be an effective teaching tool. We found that for all of the four pairs we studied users could understand the unfamiliar visualization method either fully or at least significantly better after they observed or interacted with a series of transitions from the familiar counterpart.

Why Learn Hadoop?

Big Data! A Worldwide Problem?

According to Wikipedia, ""Big data is collection of data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional data processing applications."" In simpler terms, Big Data is a term given to large volumes of data that organizations store and process. However, it is becoming very difficult for companies to store, retrieve and process the ever-increasing data. If any company gets hold on managing its data well, nothing can stop it from becoming the next BIG success!

The problem lies in the use of traditional systems to store enormous data. Though these systems were a success a few years ago, with increasing amount and complexity of data, these are soon becoming obsolete. The good news is - Hadoop has become an integral part for storing, handling, evaluating and retrieving hundreds of terabytes, and even petabytes of data.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

Opportunities for Hadoopers!

Opportunities for Hadoopers are infinite - from a Hadoop Developer, to a Hadoop Tester or a Hadoop Architect, and so on. If cracking and managing BIG Data is your passion in life, then think no more and Join Edureka's Hadoop Online course and carve a niche for yourself!

Unlike some of the ...,16.0,Reinforcement,"Reinforcement learning is particularly useful in situations where we want to train AIs to have certain skills we don‚Äôt fully understand ourselves. Unlike some of the techniques we‚Äôve discussed so far, reinforcement learning generally only looks at how an AI performs a task AFTER it has completed it. And when an AI completes that task figuring out when and how to reward an AI, called credit assignment,  is one of the hardest parts of reinforcement learning. So today, we‚Äôre going to explore these ideas, introduce a ton of new terms like value, policy, agent, environment, actions, and states and we‚Äôll show you how we can use strategies like exploration and exploitation to train John Green Bot to find things more efficiently next time.

A/B: Create two or more variations of your website by changing the headline, button, image, or any other elements in a webpage. After you create your website variations, VWO divides your website traffic among all variations to help you find out the one with the best conversion rate.

Multivariate: Modify multiple elements across your website pages and test the variations simultaneously. After you implement all changes across your website, VWO combines all the changes you make and generate resulting designs automatically. Test each element you modified to find the most optimal design.

Split URL: Test multiple versions of your website hosted on different URLs by splitting traffic among each version. Track test reports to determine the version that gets you maximum conversions. VWO only splits the traffic between previously hosted URLs for variations. You will not be able to implement any changes inside VWO.

Hello everyone. Now that you are familiar with the two basic clustering techniques, let us discuss an important step in processing data that we should apply before performing clustering.

Why do we need to prepare data for clustering?

Imagine a situation where you have a set of variables with incomparable units - such as the dimensions of a product and its price.

Even if variables have the same unit, they may be significantly different in terms of their scales and variances. For instance, the amount that one may spend on an inexpensive item like cereals is low as compared to traveling expenses.

If we use data in this raw form, the results of clustering may be biased.

The clusters formed may be dependent on one variable significantly more than the other.

How do we account for these issues, then? We use a process called normalization.

What is normalization of data? 

It is a process by which we rescale the values of a variable with respect to standard deviation of the data. The resultant standard deviation post normalization is 1.

The process of normalization is simple and achieved through dividing a value by its standard deviation.

Let us look at its implementation in Python. A normalization library is available on the SciPy package, using the whiten method of the vq class. 

First, we initiate the data to be normalized in a list and then use the whiten method, to transform. The array may be one or multi dimensional. 

Note that, in the example, we use a one dimensional list. In case of a multi dimensional array or list of lists, whiten divides each value by the standard deviation of the column. The result of the whiten method is an array of the same dimensions.

Let us look at a plot using the matplotlib library in Python to compare the results of the normalization process.

First, you need import the pyplot class of the matplotlib library in Python. We initialized the two lists which contain the original and scaled data points. By default, pyplot plots line graphs. 

Next, we enable the legend in the graph and then display the plot. Let us see how the plot looks like.

The original and scaled lists have been plotted in blue and orange colors, respectively. The serial number of the points is in the x axis, whereas the value of the original and scaled data points is in the y axis. As you can see, the variation in the scaled data has been toned down from the original data. Interestingly, the trends remain similar to the original data though.

With this, we come to the end of this demonstration. It is time for you get familiar with the normalization process by writing some code of your own.

Learning path on Power BI?

Power Query:
Power Query is a self-service ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tool which runs as an Excel add-in. 

Power Pivot is an in-memory data modeling component that enables highly-compressed data storage and extremely fast aggregation and calculation.

Who needs Power Pivot and why?

1. Data sets that stretch the capacity of traditional Excel (file size, re-calculation speed etc).

2. Writing a lot of VLOOKUP (or INDEX/MATCH) formulas to join data from different tables so you can analyze in a Pivot Table.

3. Send hours rebuilding the report when asked for a different view of the data (e.g. Sales for Same Month Previous Year vs. Previous Month)

4. Start using Power BI¬†at Intermediate to Advanced level

So far in this series, we've mostly focused on how AI can interpret images, but one of the most common ways we interact with computers is through language - we type questions into search engines, use our smart assistants like Siri and Alexa to set alarms and check the weather, and communicate across language barriers with the help of Google Translate. Today, we're going to talk about Natural Language Processing, or NLP, show you some strategies computers can use to better understand language like distributional semantics, and then we'll introduce you to a type of neural network called a Recurrent Neural Network or RNN to build sentences.

This video's topic on my blog: http://javaprogrammingforbeginners.com/learn-java-programming-fast/

About Me: http://javaprogrammingforbeginners.com/index.php/about-me/

____________________________________________________________________

Now, there are a lot of skills that you‚Äôd need if you want to be a successful software developer, but in today's dynamic environment, learning programming for Java can be very beneficial.

Most university courses and AP Computer Science courses are taught in the programming language of Java...

...I know this from experience since I learned Java and Android with Treehouse and my AP Computer Science class was a breeze.

You can continue on to do android app development with your java skills or just build java applications alone.

This is particularly important if you want to start off your professional path as soon as possible.

Anyway, looking back to when I learned Java and Android development I made a lot of mistakes that I believed would speed up my learning process...

...but they actually slowed down my learning and impeded my growth as a coder overall.

Here are 4 tips that you can use to learn java programming fast as a complete beginner while avoiding common mistakes:

1.) Don‚Äôt Rush To Learn Programming

Even though it might sound a bit confusing ‚Äì this is absolutely critical.

If you want to learn java fast, you need to take your time in understanding the overall coding logic.

Kind of contradictory, but the more you take your time, the faster you will learn the very basis of the programming language.

If you manage to handle this and actually understand how things are aligned logically, you will be able to learn java fast.

If you rush through the first few lessons, thinking that this is easy, you will have trouble later on as your foundation won‚Äôt be solid.

Also, when learning java online as a beginner, you must...

2.) Pay Attention to Mistakes

Small mistakes accumulate overtime...
If reading this you have likely never coded before or you are a beginner to programming in general.

In order to understand how to learn java online, you need to make sure that you take your time.

It is natural to overlook the ""small"" mistakes you make at first when learning, but they soon snowball into great deficiencies

You will make a lot of mistakes ‚Äì a lot of them. This doesn‚Äôt need to discourage you or something of the kind ‚Äì it needs to motivate you. Every single mistake is a lesson that you need to learn from.

This doesn‚Äôt need to discourage you ‚Äì it needs to motivate you.

Every single mistake is a lesson that you need to learn from and fix properly so that you have reinforced the lesson in your mind.

Make sure that when you learn to code java (or any programming language) that you...

Do you remember your hands feeling cold, your legs shaking and sometimes your voice even trembling? Well, presentations are important to everyone, whether at school, university, when looking for a job, while at a job, when starting a business and when seeking investment or financing. It is one of the essential skills in any career whether you are an academic, a doctor or a business person. Therefore, improving your presentation skills is vital to be able to convey your message to others with full confidence and clarity.

Presentation skills are vital to everyone for the following 5 reasons:

1. Individual and Business Success: The first ‚Äòreal‚Äô presentation an individual normally goes through is a Job Interview. How well you present yourself doesn‚Äôt guarantee success but certainly improves your chances of success. Also career growth, promotion and business progress all depend on good presentation skills.
2. Time Management: Great presenters use the most effective techniques to communicate their message across in less time focusing on the key elements.
3. Leadership: Great leaders are known for their effective ways in expressing their inspiring thoughts to their team, community and sometimes even to the public.
4. Public Image: You will be judged according to how you deliver your message. By conveying your topic clearly, you set a good image not only of yourself but also on behalf of your team or organization.
5. Stress Reduction: Miscommunication is the biggest cause of work related stress. Good presenters reduce miscommunication in their environment.

As explained, presentation skills are important for a number of reasons so, start working on improving them. Becoming a better presenter is becoming a better communicator and thus, becoming a more successful individual!

So, why do I tell people not to learn it?

There are multiple reasons for this, but the biggest is that Python doesn't provide a path to success. It is a tool and can be used for many things, but it is not ideal if you are a new programmer.

New programmers should pick a path, especially the paths I list in this video.

If you want to know WHAT you should learn in 2021 as a new programmer, watch it!

A #graph in this context is made up of vertices (also called nodes or points) which are connected by edges (also called links or lines). A distinction is made between undirected graphs, where edges link two vertices symmetrically, and directed graphs, where edges link two vertices asymmetrically; see Graph (discrete mathematics) for more detailed definitions and for other variations in the types of graph that are commonly considered. Graphs are one of the prime objects of study in discrete mathematics.

sjGjoDiD2F8,Java Tutorial for Absolute Beginners: Learn Java in 3 hours,Rock the JVM,https://youtube.com/watch?v=sjGjoDiD2F8,2020-06-24T14:55:19Z,"Java tutorial for beginners - Become a Java programmer.

If you don't have any background into programming (or Java), this video is made for you.

Download this here: https://rockthejvm.com/p/java-tutorial-for-beginners

This video might look a bit weird and vertical, don't worry! I made this so you can follow along more easily: just take the video on half of your screen, and use your code editor on the other half, so you don't need too go back and forth between your code and the video.

- On Windows and some Linux OSes: drag this window until the mouse hits the left or right edge of the screen. It should resize to half the screen.
- On Mac: Make the video and your code editor fullscreen and then in the multi-desktop view, just drag one onto the other (see around 3.00).

In this Java tutorial, you will install Java 14 and your first development environment and you will learn to write your first Java applications. You will:
- understand how Java works on many platforms and why it's so popular
- create variables in Java, of various types
- compute any expressions you want, on different types
- make the computer do different things based on conditions
- make the computer automatically repeat instructions
- define your own data types with classes
- customize your data types with fields and methods
- understand the difference between access modifiers public and private
- write class-level fields and methods with the static modifier
- understand how a Java application runs

By the end of this Java tutorial, you will create your first chatbot - we'll call it Rock - which will greet you politely by your name, and will compute your age based on the information you give it. After that, it will perform a repetitive task very, very fast.

Table of contents:

In this series we're going to take a look at the important role statistics play in our everyday lives, because statistics are everywhere! Statistics help us better understand the world and make decisions from what you'll wear tomorrow to government policy. But in the wrong hands, statistics can be used to misinform. So we're going to try to do two things in this series. Help show you the usefulness of statistics, but also help you become a more informed consumer of statistics. From probabilities, paradoxes, and p-values there's a lot to cover in this series, and there will be some math, but we promise only when it's most important. But first, we should talk about what statistics actually are, and what we can do with them. Statistics are tools, but they can't give us all the answers.

‚≠êWhy MongoDB is important?
MongoDB stores data in a JSON document format. This allows you to throw whatever data you want from it without worrying about the relations of the data. The fact that it is a JSON store also means that information can be retrieved very quickly. Things that would take minutes for relational databases to find can be found in MongoDB in mere seconds. Basically, in any situation where the data isn‚Äôt relational and needs to be processed quickly, MongoDB is the database you should be choosing. This is why in most big data workplaces, you will find MongoDB (or a similar database) being used instead of the databases we are used to.

‚≠êWhy should you opt for a MongoDB career?
If you want to fast-track your career then you should strongly consider MongoDB. The reason for this is that it is one of the fastest growing technology. There is a huge demand for MongoDB. The salaries for MongoDB is fantastic.There is a huge growth opportunity in this domain as well.

You can use these policies to implement controllers and decision-making algorithms for complex applications such as resource allocation, robotics, and autonomous systems.

The toolbox lets you represent policies and value functions using deep neural networks or look-up tables and train them through interactions with environments modeled in MATLAB¬Æ or Simulink. You can evaluate the single- or multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms provided in the toolbox or develop your own. You can experiment with hyperparameter settings, monitor training progress, and simulate trained agents either interactively through the app or programmatically. To improve training performance, simulations can be run in parallel on multiple CPUs, GPUs, computer clusters, and the cloud (with Parallel Computing Toolbox‚Ñ¢ and MATLAB Parallel Server‚Ñ¢).

Through the ONNX‚Ñ¢ model format, existing policies can be imported from deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow‚Ñ¢ Keras and PyTorch (with Deep Learning Toolbox‚Ñ¢). You can generate optimized C, C++, and CUDA¬Æ code to deploy trained policies on microcontrollers and GPUs. The toolbox includes reference examples to help you get started.

Natural Language Processing, popularly known in its abbreviated form NLP, is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that deals with the interaction between humans and computers using the natural language. Its ultimate objective is to meet, understand, and make sense of the human language. NLP is that branch of AI that helps computers to interpret, understand and manipulate the human language. NLP helps developers to structure and organize information to perform tasks such as speech recognition, translation, summarization, relationship extraction, etc. NLP is a way for computers to understand, analyze, and derive meaning from human languages.

As Africa‚Äôs biggest classroom, we are committed to helping kids become life-long learners through fun educational content delivered via the technologies they have access to in the languages they speak. During the current global health crisis, we are offering our learning resources for free to families across Africa and the diaspora and we are working hard to create more resources that meet the needs that kids have now - specifically, to continue to learn safely at home in local languages.

Over 1.2 billion kids and youth have been affected by the global health crisis, but while the majority of developed countries have effectively implemented national distance learning programs, only 30% of low-income countries-especially in Africa- have been able to do so. This, coupled with the fact that over 80% of learners in sub-Saharan Africa do not have access to the internet or digital learning devices like computers means that there are millions of kids right now missing out on an education.

The ONLY way to reach the majority of Africa‚Äôs kids right now is via accessible technologies like radio, TV and basic mobile phones. Support Ubongo‚Äôs #Learning4All fund to reach these kids and keep them learning.

---

Hi, my name is Ryan and I will be your instructor for this course on customer analytics and A/B Testing. This is a fascinating subject, and I'm looking forward to the opportunity to explore it with you.

The primary focus of this course is A/B testing. A/B testing is a tool that allows you to test two or more different ideas against each other in the real world, and to see which one empirically performs better.

Because you are running this test in the real world, there is no guessing. You get to know which idea is better under the conditions that matter most. Beyond that, it has many other benefits. It can provide accurate answers quickly, allowing companies to rapidly iterate on ideas. At its core, it is one of the only statistically sound ways to establish causal relationships.
We will dive into all of this later in the course.

Simply speaking, A/B testing works by exposing unique randomly assigned groups of users to each of the ideas you want to test. Then you can observe these users, and by measuring how they behave, untangle the impact of each of your ideas ultimately determining which is best.

If you have users and ideas, then chances are you can run an A/B test. It is utilized in fields as diverse as pharmaceutical companies testing the impact of different drugs to mobile games trying to incentivize users to spend more, and subscription services working to drive user growth, as well as many more use cases beyond these.

Before you can perform an A/B test you must first understand what is worth testing and optimizing for. The first chapter will cover this topic in detail. Once we understand these metrics we discuss exploratory data analysis in chapter 2, which leads naturally to the bulk of the course, on how to design and analyzing A/B tests in practice. These topics will be covered thoroughly in the final two chapters of the course.

We will finish off this lesson by briefly discussing KPIs.

Typically, A/B tests are run to improve Key Performance Indicators or KPIs. These are the metrics that are most important to the business or organization you are a part of. For a drug company, these may be remission rates of cancer, or the likelihood of a particular side-effect. For a mobile game, it may be something like revenue or playtime per user.

Identifying the right KPIs requires a combination of experience, domain knowledge, and exploratory data analysis. Experience and knowledge will tell you what is likely to be an important driver of the business, and analysis allows you to uncover relationships that reveal which metrics truly measure these drivers.

Starting in the next video, we will dive headfirst into exploring a customer data set, and begin to work through an example to identify which metrics are meaningful and which are not. We will explore this in a way that interleaves the mechanics of doing the analysis with the art that makes up much of data exploration.

We will continue with similar examples throughout the course to show how the A/B testing process grows out of the ideas of KPIs & exploratory data analysis.

Now let‚Äôs work through some exercises on the high-level A/B testing material we just covered. From there we will dive into some live data and code. Good luck!

This Machine Learning basics video will help you understand what is Machine Learning, what are the types of Machine Learning - supervised, unsupervised & reinforcement learning, how Machine Learning works with simple examples, and will also explain how Machine Learning is being used in various industries. Machine learning is a core sub-area of artificial intelligence; it enables computers to get into a mode of self-learning without being explicitly programmed. When exposed to new data, these computer programs are enabled to learn, grow, change, and develop by themselves. So, put simply, the iterative aspect of machine learning is the ability to adapt to new data independently. This is possible as programs learn from previous computations and use ‚Äúpattern recognition‚Äù to produce reliable results. 

Below topics are explained in this Machine Learning basics video:
1. What is Machine Learning? ( 00:21 )
2. Types of Machine Learning ( 02:43 )
2. What is Supervised Learning? ( 02:53 )
3. What is Unsupervised Learning? ( 03:46 )
4. What is Reinforcement Learning? ( 04:37 )
5. Machine Learning applications ( 06:25 )

Probability and statistics on Khan Academy: We dare you to go through a day in which you never consider or use probability. Did you check the weather forecast? Busted! Did you decide to go through the drive through lane vs walk in? Busted again! We are constantly creating hypotheses, making predictions, testing, and analyzing. Our lives are full of probabilities! Statistics is related to probability because much of the data we use when determining probable outcomes comes from our understanding of statistics. In these tutorials, we will cover a range of topics, some which include: independent events, dependent probability, combinatorics, hypothesis testing, descriptive statistics, random variables, probability distributions, regression, and inferential statistics. So buckle up and hop on for a wild ride. We bet you're going to be challenged AND love it!

About the ML Master's Program

Edureka‚Äôs Machine Learning Masters Program makes you proficient in techniques like Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning and Natural Language Processing. It includes training on the latest advancements and technical approaches in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning such as Deep Learning, Graphical Models and Reinforcement Learning.

----------------------

Why Learn Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is a concept which allows the machine to learn from examples and experience, and that too without being explicitly programmed. So instead of you writing the code, what you do is you feed data to the generic algorithm, and the algorithm/machine builds the logic based on the given data.

Imagine you're a retail company with global stores working in local currencies. Using an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline in Node.js would be a great tool to standardize and analyze revenue. ETL is a process of extracting data from one location, transforming it in some way, and then loading it somewhere else. We can use this process to convert large amounts of data in Node.js from one format to another.

By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:

 -Understand the different steps of an ETL pipeline, and why it‚Äôs useful to break the process up in this manner
 -Identify when we might need to use an ETL pipeline
 -List different examples of an ETL pipeline

We use helpful analogies to explain a high-level overview of spreadsheets, tables, and database management systems. The logic and concepts in this tutorial will make it easier to understand the more technical aspects of database architecture and Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD).

When it comes to organizing data, we often start by compiling everything into a single spreadsheet (or table). But that approach isn't scalable. As more data floods the system, a single table will result in misleading information, duplicate data, and errors.

A better method is to split your data up into smaller tables that have a narrower focus. These tables organize your data in a more efficient way and come together via relationships to form a database. And a database management system is the software that handles the storage, retrieval, and updating of that database.

Database Management Systems are closely related to Entity Relationship Diagrams. If you've spent any time in a database management system, you know that they typically don‚Äôt give you the best options for visualizing your database. It‚Äôs all in the programming language and it‚Äôs hard to see where the connections are. That‚Äôs where Entity Relationship Diagrams come in. It‚Äôs a visual way of looking at your database structure. Each table translates into an entity. And your columns in each table are listed as attributes in their respective entity. Finally, the programmed connections between your tables are visualized through relationship lines.

Lucidchart is a visual productivity platform that can help you visualize your Database Management System. Our ERD import and export tool make it easy to translate your database into a diagram that helps you spot database errors, find potential improvements, and onboard others to your database.

What Exactly is Machine Learning?
A good start at a Machine Learning definition is that it is a core sub-area of Artificial Intelligence (AI). ML applications learn from experience (well data) like humans without direct programming. When exposed to new data, these applications learn, grow, change, and develop by themselves. In other words, with Machine Learning, computers find insightful information without being told where to look. Instead, they do this by leveraging algorithms that learn from data in an iterative process.

What is Artificial Intelligence?
Artificial Intelligence is a method of making a computer, a computer-controlled robot, or software think intelligently like the human mind. AI is accomplished by studying the patterns of the human brain and by analyzing the cognitive process. The outcome of these studies develops intelligent software and systems.

Heatmaps enable the viewers to take powerful decisions, instantly just by taking a glimpse at the graph.

In order to Plot a Heatmap in Tableau, I will be using the Superstore Data, the demo data came with Tableau Desktop. I will create a Heatmap of profit distributed over Category, Subcategory and Segments of Superstore Data. For that, I have Dragged and Dropped Category and Subcategory to the Rows Field of Tableau and Segment to the Columns Field. It will create a basic structure of the visualization but will not display any value. 

For the values, I will Drag and Drop the Profit Measure of Superstore Data to the Label Marks of Tableau; Now we can see Digits in the Plot. In order to Make the Heatmap, just do the same and drop the Profit value to Color Marks of Tableau. At this point, we are just one step behind success; now in the Graph Field of Tableau Marks, Select Square. Ta-Da! You have got a fine looking Heatmaps with Values to it; if you are not comfortable with the Digits, just remove the Label Marks.

Hope you liked the tutorial. You can send you thoughts to me, which will inspire me to create more tutorials on Tableau and other Business Intelligence and Data Science related tools.

What‚Äôs more, most available machine learning toolboxes (e.g. scikit-learn) are limited to the tabular setting, and cannot easily be applied to time series data.

In this tutorial, you‚Äôll learn how to apply common machine learning techniques to time series and how to extend available toolkits. This is a beginner-friendly tutorial: we assume familiarity with scikit-learn, but no prior experience with time series.

To start, you‚Äôll learn how to distinguish between different kinds of temporal data and associated learning tasks, such as forecasting and time series classification. You‚Äôll then learn how to solve these tasks with machine learning techniques specific to time series data, including:

State-of-the-art algorithms for time series classification and regression, Reduction strategies, i.e. solving a complex learning tasks by decomposing it into simpler tasks, e.g. solving forecasting via regression, Composite strategies like ensembling and pipelining, as well as data transformations like detrending and feature extraction. We‚Äôll work through all of them step by step and make use of interactive Jupyter notebooks and sktime, a new scikit-learn compatible toolbox for machine learning with time series: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/sktime

Hello Friends,
            In this video, we are going to learn Correlation and Regression with the help of practical examples In Excel.
            As seen in the last video, we can use scatter plots to understand the relationships between variables, but it is applied only for obvious relationships like Temperature and Viscosity. Sometimes, it is impossible to only comment on the relationship between variables only by looking at the graph. In such a case, Correlation and Regression come into the picture.
            The ‚ÄúCORRELATION & REGRESSION‚Äù are very important mathematical concepts to define the relationship between variables. 
            This video consists of the following points:
‚úÖIntroduction: Why Correlation and Regression are needed?
‚úÖCorrelation
‚úÖCorrelation Analysis
‚úÖCorrelation Coefficient
‚úÖCalculation of Correlation Coefficient
‚úÖCorrelation Coefficient In Excel
‚úÖRegression
‚úÖRegression In Excel
‚úÖR-Square value 
‚úÖSignificance F and P-value
‚úÖCoefficients
‚úÖResiduals
‚úÖConclusion

financial reports are usually issued on a quarterly and annual basis. this is different from management reporting, which is financial information that is disclosed to those inside the company to be used to make decisions within the company. Financial reports are included in a public company's annual report.

financial reporting serves two primary purposes. first, it helps management to engage in effective decision-making concerning the company's objectives and overall strategies. the data disclosed in the reports can help management discern the strengths and weaknesses of the company, as well as its overall financial health.

second, financial reporting provides vital information about the financial health and activities of the company to its stakeholders including its shareholders, potential investors, consumers, and government regulators. It's a means of ensuring that the company is being run appropriately. You should note that if a company is publicly traded, it is subject to some very strict reporting regulations enforced by the securities and exchange commission (SEC).

C++ is a general purpose, middle level, compiled, object oriented programming language by using which we can write computer programs / software's.

it is created by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979.
initially called as ""C with Classes"" 
Later in 1983 name was changed to c++

It began as the expanded version of c language and the creators added the object oriented programming approach to it.

C++ is an efficient language and it is reliable and runs fast. it is widely used for developing games, compilers, operating systems, gui application and many other areas.

In this part, we're going to focus on Q-Learning.

Q-Learning is a model-free form of machine learning, in the sense that the AI ""agent"" does not need to know or have a model of the environment that it will be in. The same algorithm can be used across a variety of environments.

For a given environment, everything is broken down into ""states"" and ""actions."" The states are observations and samplings that we pull from the environment, and the actions are the choices the agent has made based on the observation. For the purposes of the rest of this tutorial, we'll use the context of our environment to exemplify how this works.

We will ...",17.0,NOSQL,"Learn how NoSQL databases work and learn when NoSQL is a better option than standard relational databases, and just as importantly when it‚Äôs not. We will also walk through some of the popular forms of NoSQL databases and how you can access them for your applications in this NoSQL Tutorial for Beginners.

So first and foremost: what are NoSQL databases and why should I care about them? The easiest way to understand the definition is that NoSQL databases are not SQL databases. Standard relational SQL databases such as Oracle‚Äôs SQL server or MySQL have a tabular structure, similar to what you‚Äôd see in an Excel spreadsheet. Whereas NoSQL databases have various types of formats and can therefore be more flexible.

For example, imagine that you had to build an application where users were able to define their own fields, such as a survey application where one user may create a survey with two fields and another may create a survey with a hundred fields, and they need to have the ability to be named on the fly. Technically it would be possible to implement this with a relational database, however it would be very clunky. However NoSQL databases could handle this easily, by allowing the fields to be created dynamically and then each record would could be stored with its unique characteristics.

It‚Äôs important to note that one of the greatest strengths of NoSQL, it‚Äôs flexibility, also presents its greatest challenge. Imagine that you are building out an inventory application that has fields that need to connect to other tables, such as a user table for the employee entering the information, a vendor table, and a tax table to calculate depreciation. If you were to attempt to implement a NoSQL database for this inventory option you‚Äôd end up having to work very hard to map the values between the models and it would also make for a very difficult application to maintain. In this case study a relational database (rdms) would work perfectly.

So when you‚Äôre trying to decide on NoSQL database design, it really comes down to what the requirements of the application are. If you wanted to chop a tree down you wouldn‚Äôt use hammer, you‚Äôd use an axe because it‚Äôs basic common sense to utilize the right tool for the right job. And it‚Äôs the same way with software development, I don‚Äôt believe in the SQL vs NoSQL debate, they are both tools and they are the most effective when used in an application that works well with their strengths.

A good rule of thumb is to simply follow the guidelines given by the names themselves:

- If you have data that relies heavily on relationships then it‚Äôs probably the best fit to utilized a relational SQL database.

- If you have an unstructured data set that needs flexibility, than it may be the best option to go with a database that is Not SQL, such as a NoSQL database.

With an insider's view of the mind of the master, Mary Buffett and David Clark have written a simple guide for reading financial statements from Warren Buffett's succccessful perspective.

Buffett and Clark clearly outline Warren Buffett's strategies in a way that will appeal to newcomers and seasoned Buffettologists alike. Inspired by the seminal work of Buffett's mentor, Benjamin Graham (The Interpretation of Financial Statements, 1937), this book presents Buffett's interpretation of financial statements with anecdotes and quotes from the master investor himself.

Potential investors will discover:

‚Ä¢ Buffett's time-tested dos and don'ts for interpreting an income statement and balance sheet
‚Ä¢ Why high research and development costs can kill a great business
‚Ä¢ How much debt Buffett thinks a company can carry before it becomes too dangerous to touch
‚Ä¢ The financial ratios and calculations that Buffett uses to identify the company with a durable competitive advantage -- which he believes makes for the winning long-term investment
‚Ä¢ How Buffett uses financial statements to value a company
‚Ä¢ What kinds of companies Warren stays away from no matter how cheap their selling price

Once readers complete and master Buffett's simple financial calculations and methods for interpreting a company's financial statement, they'll be well on their way to identifying which companies are going to be tomorrow's winners -- and which will be the losers they should avoid at all costs.

Destined to become a classic in the world of investment books, Warren Buffett and the Interpretation of Financial Statements is the perfect companion volume to The New Buffettology and The Tao of Warren Buffett.",Balance Sheet; Financial Statement; Income Statement; Investment; Research and Development (R&D)

From spam filters and self-driving cars, to cutting edge medical diagnosis and real-time language translation, there has been an increasing need for our computers to learn from data and apply that knowledge to make predictions and decisions. This is the heart of machine learning which sits inside the more ambitious goal of artificial intelligence. We may be a long way from self-aware computers that think just like us, but with advancements in deep learning and artificial neural networks our computers are becoming more powerful than ever.
